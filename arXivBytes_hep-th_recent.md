## 0. The Classical Super-Phaserotation Infrared Triangle

**Authors:** Sangmin Choi, Alok Laddha, Andrea Puhm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16149v1)

**Summary:**

The universality of the logarithmic soft photon theorem in four dimensions can be traced to an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts as a local phase rotation on matter. Here we extend our earlier results for the charges associated to these superphaserotations to all orders in the coupling. We furthermore generalize the formulae for the associated electromagnetic displacement memory and its tail from particles to scalar matter fields. This completes the classicalsuperphaserotation infrared triangle.

## 1. Quantitative classicality in cosmological interactions during inflation

**Authors:** Yoann L. Launay, Gerasimos I. Rigopoulos, E. Paul S. Shellard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the classical and quantum evolution of inflationary cosmological perturbations from quantum initial conditions. We calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order bispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by the on-shell evolution. The insights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying the validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations in inflation. We also show how stochastic dynamics can emerge as a sufficient approximation to the full quantum evolution.

## 2. The Classical Super-Rotation Infrared Triangle

**Authors:** Sangmin Choi, Alok Laddha, Andrea Puhm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16142v1)

**Summary:**

In four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes the infinite enhancement of translations, extending the Poincar\'e group to the BMS group, is the symmetry underlying Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and the gravitational displacement memory effect. Beyond this leading infrared triangle, loop corrections alter their nature by introducing logarithms in the soft expansion and late time tails to the memory, and this persists in the classical limit. In this work we give the first complete description of an `infrared triangle' where the long-range nature of gravitational interactions is accounted for.

## 3. Borel singularities and Stokes constants of the topological string free   energy on one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds

**Authors:** Simon Douaud, Amir-Kian Kashani-Poor

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16140v1)

**Summary:**

We study the Borel plane of the topological string free energy on all hypergeometric one-parameter Calabi-Yau models close to singular points in moduli space. We find that in models which exhibit massless D-branes at a singular point, the central charge of the D- brane close to the singular point coincides with the location of the leading Borel singularity. We also find that the Donaldson-Thomas invariant associated to the charge, in as far as its value is known, corresponds with the Stokes constant.

## 4. Henneaux-Teitelboim Form of the Generalized Unimodular Gravity Action

**Authors:** Dmitry Nesterov, Ksenia Lyamkina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16139v1)

**Summary:**

We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG) The central feature of this formulation is the consistent incorporation of time reparameterization. This enhances the gauge structure and reveals a spatial nonlocality hidden in the original formulation. We identify a subset of GUMG models for which the alternative formulation preserves manifest locality. We show that the gauge symmetry in the gravitational sector is extended by a functionally incomplete symmetry, as occurs in the unimodularity gravity. We examine the resulting dynamics, emphasizing the effects of spatial non Locality.

## 5. Asymptotic T-duality in three dimensions

**Authors:** Stéphane Detournay, José Figueroa, Alejandro Vilar López

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16136v1)

**Summary:**

In (super)gravity theories, T-duality relates solutions with an exact isometry which can have wildly different asymptotic behaviors. A well-known example is the duality between BTZ black holes and (non-extremal) three-dimensional black strings. Using this dual pair, we show how the knowledge of a phase space which includes one set of solutions can be used to obtain a dual set. On the way, we find a large algebra of symmetries for the black string phase space.

## 6. Full S-matrices and Witten diagrams with (relative) L-infinity algebras

**Authors:** Luigi Alfonsi, Leron Borsten, Hyungrok Kim, Martin Wolf, Charles Alastair Stephen Young

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16106v1)

**Summary:**

The $L_\infty$-algebra approach to scattering amplitudes elegantly describes the nontrivial part of the $S$-matrix but fails to take into account the trivial part. We argue that the trivial contribution should be accounted for by another, complementary $L-Algebra. This construction reproduces Witten diagrams that arise in AdS/CFT including, in particular, the trivial Witten diagram corresponding to CFT two-point functions. We also discuss Chern-Simons theory and Yang-Mills theory on manifolds with boundaries using this approach.

## 7. One-loop corrections to near extremal Kerr thermodynamics from   semiclassical Virasoro blocks

**Authors:** Paolo Arnaudo, Giulio Bonelli, Alessandro Tanzini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16057v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse in detail four-dimensional Kerr black hole and show that in the near-extremal limit a branch of long-lived modes arises. We prove that the contribution of these modes accounts for a correction to the entropy for massless particles of spin $s=1,2$. In the full calculation performed in the exact Kerr background the leading contribution actually is sourced by theNear-horizon region only, and as such has a universal validity for any asymptotic behavior at infinity.

## 8. Functional renormalization of QCD in $1 + 1$ dimensions: four-fermion   interactions from quark-gluon dynamics

**Authors:** Eric Oevermann, Adrian Koenigstein, Stefan Floerchinger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16051v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum Chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions is investigated with the Functional Renormalization Group. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work.

## 9. Generalized Wilson lines and the gravitational scattering of spinning   bodies

**Authors:** Domenico Bonocore, Anna Kulesza, Johannes Pirsch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16049v1)

**Summary:**

A generalization of Wilson line operators at subleading power in the soft expansion has been recently introduced as an efficient building block of gravitational scattering amplitudes for non-spinning objects. Building on the well-studied worldline model with supersymmetry, in this work we extend the generalized Wilson line (GWL) approach to the case of spinning gravitating bodies. At the quantum level we derive from first-principles a representation for the spin $1/2$ GWL that is relevant for the all-order factorization of next-to-soft gravitons.

## 10. Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moiré bilayer graphene

**Authors:** Jan Biedermann, Lukas Janssen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042v1)

**Summary:**

Moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric DiracSemimetal ground state.

## 11. Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D   Integrals

**Authors:** Matthew Reinhard, Zachary Slepian, Jiamin Hou, Alessandro Greco

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037v1)

**Summary:**

Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. We investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field.

## 12. Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw

**Authors:** Jingtao You, Linghao Song, Hong-Jian He, Chengcheng Han

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033v1)

**Summary:**

The neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. The inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right- handed neutrines that respects the shift symmetry. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrini seesaw mechanism. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 13. Fuzzy-Space Engineering

**Authors:** Paul Schreivogl, Riachard Schweiger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16011v1)

**Summary:**

We study the representation of fuzzy surfaces using these techniques. This involves constructing graphs and writing their coordinates and connectivity into matrices. A script generates the three matrices from the graphs. These matrices are then processed in Wolfram Mathematica to calculate the zero modes of the Dirac operator. Our first result shows the quantization of a two-dimensional Trefoil knot. Additional examples illustrate various properties and behaviors of this process. This work contributes to advancing the understanding of visualization aspects in fuzzy geometry.

## 14. Ti and Spi, Carrollian extended boundaries at timelike and spatial   infinity

**Authors:** Jack Borthwick, Maël Chantreau, Yannick Herfray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we provide a definition for a notion of extended boundary at time and space-like infinity. This definition applies to asymptotically flat spacetime in the sense of Ashtekar--Romano and we wish to demonstrate, by example, its pertinence in a number of situations. Ti and Spi are both naturally equipped with (strong) Carrollian geometries which, under mild assumptions, enable to reduce the symmetry group down to the BMS group or to Poincar\'e in the flat case.

## 15. Feynman Integral Reduction without Integration-By-Parts

**Authors:** Ziwen Wang, Li Lin Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15962v1)

**Summary:**

We present an interesting study of Feynman integral reduction that does not employ integration-by-parts identities. We find that the integration contour can take a more general form than that given by the Cheng-Wu theorem. We apply this idea to one-loop integrals, and derive universal reduction formulas that can be used to efficiently reduce any one- loop integral. We expect that this approach can be useful in the reduction of multi-loopintegrals as well. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 16. Effective Metric Description of 2+1 Dimensional Quantum Black Holes

**Authors:** Stefan Hohenegger, Mikolaj Myszkowski, Mattia Damia Paciarini, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960v1)

**Summary:**

We develop an effective metric description of 2+1 dimensional black holes. It describes deviations from the classical Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. The effective metric is constrained by imposing the black hole symmetries and asymptotic classical behavior. We show how to recast the information encoded in a specific model of quantum BTZ known as quBTZ black hole in terms of the effective metric coefficients. This allows us to further derive the general form of the corrected Hawking temperature.

## 17. The QCD moat regime and its real-time properties

**Authors:** Wei-jie Fu, Jan M. Pawlowski, Robert D. Pisarski, Fabian Rennecke, Rui Wen, Shi Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15949v1)

**Summary:**

Dense QCD matter may exhibit crystalline phases. Their existence is reflected in a moat regime, where mesonic correlations feature spatial modulations. This gives rise to a characteristic peak in the spectral function of the pion at nonzero momentum. This peak can be interpreted as a new quasi particle, the moaton. In addition, our framework also allows us to directly test the stability of the homogeneous chiral phase against the formation of an inhomogeneous condensate in QCD. The formation of such a phase is highly unlikely for baryon chemical potentials.

## 18. Entanglement harvesting in quantum superposed spacetime

**Authors:** Anwesha Chakraborty, Lucas Hackl, Magdalena Zych

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15870v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15870v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the phenomenon of entanglement harvesting for a spacetime in quantum superposition. We use two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum scalar field. We find that it reaches its maximum when we condition the final spacetime superposition state to match the initial spacetime state. Our results demonstrate that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance entangler for both twisted and untwisted field. For the twisted field, the parameter region without entanglements exhibits a significant deviation from that observed in classical Minkowski space or a single quotient Minksowski space.

## 19. On the relation between fractional charge and statistics

**Authors:** T. H. Hansson, Rodrigo Arouca, Thomas Klein Kvorning

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes. We also show that the standard relation between fractionsal charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.

## 20. Conductivities and excitations of a holographic flavour brane Weyl   semimetal

**Authors:** Haruki Furukawa, Sacha Ployet, Ronnie Rodgers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15827v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15827v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the electrical conductivities at non-zero frequency in a top-down holographic model of a Weyl semimetal. The conductivities develop peaks and troughs as functions of real frequency at low temperatures and for $m/b$ close to the phase transition. We compute the poles of the conductivities as function of complex frequency, finding poles with small imaginary part at low temperature and close to a phase transition in the model. The model exhibits a first-order phase transition between a Weyler semmetal phase at small $m /b$ and an insulating phase at large $m/.

## 21. Free fall in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity

**Authors:** Nivaldo A. Lemos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15805v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15805v1)

**Summary:**

 modified symmetric teleparallel gravity does not obey the equivalence principle in the sense of Weinberg. In this theory, minimum length geodesics are distinct from autoparallel geodesICS. The structure of the theory makes it inevitable that a freely falling test particle follows a shortest path, a geodesic of the metric. This also has bearing on whether, under appropriate conditions, this theory is fully equivalent to general relativity. The equations that govern the motion of a freely Falling test particle involve the Levi-Civita connection, not some other connection.

## 22. Pure connection formalism and Plebanski's second heavenly equation

**Authors:** Kirill Krasnov, Arthur Lipstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15779v1)

**Summary:**

Plebanski's second heavenly equation reduces the problem of finding a self-dual Einstein metric to solving a non-linear second-order PDE for a single function. We provide a new simple derivation of both versions of the PlebanskiSecond heavenly equation. Our derivation relies on the `pure connection' description of self- dual gravity. Our results also suggest a new interpretation to the kinematic algebra of self.dual Yang-Mills theory. The Lie algebra of (0,1) vector fields on a R4 endowed with a complex structure.

## 23. Heat and work in black hole thermodynamics via holography

**Authors:** Tomohiro Shigemura, Keito Shimizu, Sotaro Sugishita, Daichi Takeda, Takuya Yoda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15697v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15697v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a formulation of black hole thermodynamics that incorporates the notions of heat and work. This formulation relies on holography, but not on energy conditions on the gravity side. We also argue that the second law serves as a necessary criterion for the UV completeness of gravitational theories. We construct a thermodynamic framework for composite black hole systems that encompasses both heat and Work. We then translate the resulting thermodynamics into the AdS gravity language. We conclude that the thermodynamics of holographic CFTs is consistent with quantum theory and the CFT correspondence.

## 24. Non-linear effects on the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background   anisotropies

**Authors:** Alina Mierna, Sabino Matarrese, Nicola Bartolo, Angelo Ricciardone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15654v1)

**Summary:**

The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anis tropies at large scales. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbation are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect.

## 25. Dynamics of the order parameter in symmetry breaking phase transitions

**Authors:** Fumika Suzuki, Wojciech H. Zurek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568v1)

**Summary:**

The formation of topological defects in second-order phase transitions can be investigated by solving partial differential equations. The temporal evolution of the order parameter predicts the essence of the adiabatic-impulse scenario, including the scaling of the freeze-out time. The spatial part of the evolution, in turn, leads to the characteristic size of domains that choose the same broken symmetry. The finding enables the exploration of Kibble-Zurek scaling using ordinary differential equations over a large range of quench timescales.

## 26. Algebras and states in super-JT gravity

**Authors:** Geoff Penington, Edward Witten

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549v1)

**Summary:**

In bosonic JT gravity, minimally coupled to bulk matter, there exists a single, delta-function-normalisable state in each $SL(2,R)$ representation of the matter QFT for any pair of positive energies $E_L, E_R$ at the left and right boundaries. Projecting the algebras of boundary observables onto these zero-energy states leads to a Type II$_1$ von Neumann factor at each boundary that contains a single operator for each supersymmetric matter boundary primary with sufficiently small R-charge.

## 27. Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the   observer-dependence of gravitational entropy

**Authors:** Julian De Vuyst, Stefan Eccles, Philipp A. Hoehn, Josh Kirklin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent, according to the authors. The entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. We also describe anantisemiclassical regime, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy. In this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. The authors conclude that gravitational entropy is a significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy.

## 0. A Pathway to Decay and Fission of Orthosymplectic Quiver Theories

**Authors:** Craig Lawrie, Lorenzo Mansi, Marcus Sperling, Zhenghao Zhong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15202v1)

**Summary:**

We present an algorithm to extract the Coulomb branch Hasse diagram of orthosymplectic 3d quiver gauge theories. The algorithm systematically predicts all descendant theories arising from Coulomb Branch Higgsing. We validate our algorithm via the 3d mirror of 4d theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ of such type. We benchmark our method via Higgssing 6d D-type orbi-instanton theories, predicting novel patterns involving products of interacting fixed points.

## 1. A Central Charge for sub-AdS Holography

**Authors:** Abir Ghosh, Chethan Krishnan, Adinath Mahalingam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15201v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15201v1)

**Summary:**

We associate a central charge to sub-AdS scales of AdS x $X$ geometries. The AdS length is the length of the long string in a stack of $N$ $backreacted$ D-branes. Our proposal applies in general dimensions, connects with and refines previous ideas about sub-matrix deconfinement & long strings. Some of our arguments draw intuition from separating branes, and have natural connections to (heating up) the Coulomb branch of the gauge theory.

## 2. On the New Factorizations of Yang-Mills Amplitudes

**Authors:** Yong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15198v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15198v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we prove the new factorization pattern for tree-level Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes proposed in a companion paper. This pattern reveals a decomposition of amplitudes into a sum of gluings of lower-point amplitudes under specific kinematic constraints. This work not only conclusively validates the proposed factorization but also provides new insights into the geometric and algebraic organization of YM amplitudes within the Cachazo-He-Yuan framework.

## 3. From black hole interior to quantum complexity through operator rank

**Authors:** Alexey Milekhin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15183v1)

**Summary:**

It has been conjectured that the size of the black hole interior captures the quantum gate complexity of the underlying boundary evolution. In this short note we aim to provide a further microscopic evidence for this by directly relating the area of a certain codimension-two surface traversing the interior to the depth of the quantum circuit. Our arguments are based on establishing such relation rigorously at early times using the notion of operator Schmidt rank and then extrapolating it to later times by mapping bulk surfaces to cuts in the circuit representation.

## 4. Capturing the Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics of Black Holes in   Quantum Computers

**Authors:** Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Kwangmin Yu, Muhammad Asaduzzaman, Raza Sabbir Sufian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15180v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15180v1)

**Summary:**

The current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. We employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure theEntanglement entropy ofHawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. We establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entangled entropy of complex quantum systems.

## 5. Primordial Gravitational Wave Probes of Non-Standard Thermal Histories

**Authors:** Annet Konings, Mariia Marinichenko, Oleksii Mikulenko, Subodh P. Patil

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15144v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial gravitational waves propagate almost unimpeded from the moment they are generated to the present epoch. Given the paucity of probes of the early universe physics before nucleosynthesis, it is useful to classify how deviations from the standard thermal history can be constrained from observations of the late time stochastic background. We survey phenomenologically motivated scenarios of early matter domination, kination, and late time decaying particles as representative non-standard thermal histories. We elaborate on their late time Stochastic Background, and discuss constraints on different model scenarios.

## 6. Circle compactifications of Minkowski$_D$ solutions, flux vacua and   solitonic branes

**Authors:** Niall T. Macpherson, Paul Merrikin, Ricardo Stuardo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15102v1)

**Summary:**

G-structure techniques are used to construct broad classes of circle compactifications of Mink$_{D+1}$ solutions. Under a certain assumptions we show that the conditions that imply supersymmetry for Mink $_2$ imply those of the Mink Mink$_1$ solution. We apply our results to construct some simple Minkowski flux vacua. We then turn our attention to "solitonic branes" which are generalisations of the AdS soliton. This realises an off shell solution generating technique for supersymmetric solutions or a "supersymmetry generating" technique.

## 7. Monodromic transparency of axion domain walls

**Authors:** Simone Blasi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15085v1)

**Summary:**

The standard linear coupling to photons is generally insufficient to accurately describe the interaction of light with the defects. We take this into account in evaluating the friction experienced by axion domain walls moving in a thermal bath of photons, as well as in deriving the birefringent properties of the walls. This clarifies some results in the literature dealing with a special cancellation that takes place for the QCD axion with the electromagnetic and color anomaly as predicted by minimal Grand Unified Theories. It also explains the effects related to the breaking of the axion shift symmetry including the well-known mixing with meson states.

## 8. Islands, Double Holography, and the Entanglement Membrane

**Authors:** Hanzhi Jiang, Mike Blake, Anthony P. Thompson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15070v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as theEntanglement membrane. We show that the entangler dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglements membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi- classical gravity and a chaotic quantumMany-body system calculation of the Page curve.

## 9. Inflation in non-local hybrid metric-Palatini gravity

**Authors:** Flavio Bombacigno, Mariaveronica De Angelis, Carsten van de Bruck, William Giarè

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15064v1)

**Summary:**

The theory is based on a hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. We incorporate non-localities introduced via the inverse of the d'Alembert operators acting on the scalar curvature. We examine how the non-minimal kinetic couplings between the fields influence the number of e-folds and the field trajectories. To clarify the physical interpretation of our results, we draw analogies with benchmark single-field inflation scenarios that include spectator fields. The study was published in the journal of Theoretical Physics.

## 10. Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories

**Authors:** Baptiste Filoche, Stefan Hohenegger, Taro Kimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048v1)

**Summary:**

$A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle. A surface defect breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. We discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit.

## 11. Gravitational quasinormal modes in quadratic gravity

**Authors:** Georgios Antoniou, Leonardo Gualtieri, Paolo Pani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15037v1)

**Summary:**

We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massivespin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same.

## 12. Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays

**Authors:** Alison Warman, Fan Yang, Apoorv Tiwari, Hannes Pichler, Sakura Schafer-Nameki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024v1)

**Summary:**

Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. We propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry. We outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.

## 13. Field-dependent diffeomorphisms and the transformation of surface   charges between gauges

**Authors:** Luca Ciambelli, Marc Geiller

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14992v1)

**Summary:**

Weyl charge vanishes in the Bondi-Sachs gauge but not in the Fefferman-Graham gauge. This indicates that the gauge-dependent Weyl charge differs fundamentally from charges like mass and angular momentum. This interpretation is reinforced by two key observations: the Weyl conformal factor does not satisfy any flux-balance law, and the associated charge arises from a corner term in the symplectic structure. These properties justify assigning the Wey charge a kinematical status.

## 14. The Line operators in the G2HDM model

**Authors:** Rui Yang, Jiaming Guo, Linghai Li, Tzu-Chiang Yuan, Xun Xue

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14949v1)

**Summary:**

We describe the global structure of a particle model with dark matter called G2HDM. We also describe how the electric and magnetic charges depend on the gauge group of such model. Finally, we describe the minimal charges that arise after electroweak symmetry breaking for any choice of $G$ and $Gamma$ We conclude with an ambiguity that it may actually be $G= \tilde{G} / {\Gamma} \;$, where $G' is a subgroup of its center.

## 15. Linking disks, spinning vortices and exponential networks of   augmentation curves

**Authors:** Kunal Gupta, Pietro Longhi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14901v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14901v1)

**Summary:**

Quivers are obtained by studying M2 branes wrapping holomorphic disks with Lagrangian boundary conditions on an M5 brane. They are identified with a distinguished sector of BPS kinky vortices in the 3d-3d dual QFT. We propose a mirror derivation of the quiver description of open topological strings known as the knots-quivers correspondence. This is based on enumerative invariants of augmentation curves encoded by exponential networks. It suggests that holomorphic disk with boundary conditions are mirror to calibrated 1-chains on the associated augmentation curve, whose intersections encode the linking of boundaries.

## 16. Dilaton Weyl multiplets for $N = 3$ conformal supergravity in four   dimensions

**Authors:** Soumya Adhikari, Aravind Aikot, Madhu Mishra, Bindusar Sahoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14874v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $N = 3$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. The R-symmetry of the multiplet is $SU(2) \times U(1) $ We couple an on-shell vector multiplet to the standard Weyl. We gauge fix one of the two $U( 1)$ symmetries and rewrite the result for the dilaton multiplet with $SU (2)    $ R-Symmetry. We use the field equations of the vectors to replace some of the components of the auxiliary fields.

## 17. Diagrammatic Derivation of Hidden Zeros and Exact Factorisation of Pion   Scattering Amplitudes

**Authors:** Yang Li, Tianzhi Wang, Tomáš Brauner, Diederik Roest

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14858v1)

**Summary:**

Pion scattering amplitudes were recently found to vanish on specific kinematic loci. We propose a diagrammatic representation of pion amplitudes that makes their vanishing on the loci manifest diagram by diagram. We provide evidence that there is a closed-form expression that generalises the near-zero factorisation in an exact manner. Our approach crucially relies on a novel formulation of the effective field theory of pions, in which tree-level scattering Amplitudes are extracted from classical field equations for a set of currents and emergent composite gauge fields.

## 18. $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal gravitino in harmonic superspace

**Authors:** Evgeny Ivanov, Nikita Zaigraev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14822v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitino supermultiplet is described by unconstrained analytic prepotentials. We present the harmonic superspace formulation of the Gravitino multiplet. We speculate on the possible origin of the additional coordinates, including their relationship with supertwistors. We observe that, at cost of introducing new auxiliary coordinates, the gravitinos acquire a nice geometric interpretation as extra veilbeins of the covariant harmonic derivative of the Wess-Zumino gauge. We construct the covarianant and invariant superfield actions and sketch their component contents.

## 19. Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model

**Authors:** Marta Bucca, Márk Mezei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14799v1)

**Summary:**

The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it.

## 20. Holographic subregion complexity in a moving strongly coupled plasma

**Authors:** Mohammad Mahdi Daryaei Goki, Mohammad Ali-Akbari, Mahsa Lezgi, Vahid Esrafilian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14755v1)

**Summary:**

We study holographic subregion complexity in a moving strongly coupled plasma in dimensions d = 2, 3, 4. The proposal we employ is the one that identifies the complexity of a mixed state by the volume of codimensional-one hypersurface enclosed by Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi surface. Using the finite difference method, the numerical calculations reveal that temperature, velocity, and subregion length all have an increasing effect on holographicsubregion complexity. For arbitrary values of temperature and sub Region length, as velocity approaches its relativistic upper limit, holographicSubregion complexity exhibits a divergence.

## 21. New Modes for Vector Bosons in the Static Patch

**Authors:** Adel A. Rahman, Leonard Susskind

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14749v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a massive vector Boson in a static patch of $D$-dimensional de Sitter space (dS$_D$). We argue that this field is controlled by an effective physical (squared) mass. In $D = 3$ spacetime dimensions, the $s$-wave sector of our theory remarkably simplifies. We conjecture that the theory remains well-defined in the naively tachyonic Lagrangian mass range of $-2(D-1) < 0.

## 22. Quantum aspects of heterotic $G_2$ systems

**Authors:** Xenia de la Ossa, Magdalena Larfors, Matthew Magill, Eirik E. Svanes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14715v1)

**Summary:**

 Compactifications of the heterotic string give rise to three-dimensional supergravity theories that admit Minkowski and AdS ground states. Such vacua correspond to critical loci of a real superpotential $W$. We perform a perturbative study around a supersymmetric vacuum of the theory. We determine infinitesimal moduli and their obstructions in terms of related cohomology groups. Finally, by interpreting $W$ as an action, we compute the one-loop partition function of the $G_2$ system.

## 23. On the geometry of Lagrangian one-forms

**Authors:** Vincent Caudrelier, Derek Harland

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14700v1)

**Summary:**

Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation. We also show that our new framework easily extends to non-commuting flows corresponding to nonabelian Lie groups. Thus Hamiltonian Lie group actions can be derived from a Variational principle.

## 24. Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes

**Authors:** Goncalo Araujo-Regado, Philipp A. Hoehn, Francesco Sartini, Bilyana Tomova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548v1)

**Summary:**

Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Here, we show that there is an arguably more interesting relationship. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical reference frames for dressing subregion variables. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We anticipate that core insights extend to Yang-Mills theory andgravity.

## 25. Transformer models are gauge invariant: A mathematical connection   between AI and particle physics

**Authors:** Leo van Nierop

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14543v1)

**Summary:**

In particle physics, the fundamental forces are subject to symmetries called gauge invariance. It is a redundancy in the mathematical description of any physical system. In this article I will demonstrate that the transformer architecture exhibits the same properties. I show that the default representation of transformers has partially, but not fully removed the gauge invariance from the system. I also show that it is possible to use a different architecture to achieve the same result in a different way.

## 26. Fractionalization of flux tubes in 3d and screening by emergent electric   charges in 2d

**Authors:** Mendel Nguyen, Mithat Ünsal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14532v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a class of 3d theories with a magnetic symmetry in which confinement is generated by charge $n$ clusters of monopoles. Such theories naturally arise in quantum antiferromagnets in 2+1, QCD-like theories on $U(1)$ lattice theory with restricted monopole sums. We show that large Wilson loops are completely/partially screened for even/odd $n$, even when the compactification scale is much larger than the Debye length. We end with some remarks on screening vs. confinement.

## 27. Deformations of AdS and exact sequences

**Authors:** Andrei Mikhailov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14455v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14455v1)

**Summary:**

We give some examples of Ext groups relevant to computations in the AdS supergravity, using the pure spinor formalism. Our main examples are deformations of $AdS_5\times S^5$ transforming in finite-dimensional representations of the superconformal algebra. In the study of correlation functions, it is important to compute the resolution of BRST-exact products of vertex operators. The resolution is typically non-covariant, because of cohomological obstacles.

## 28. Anomalous Continuous Translations

**Authors:** Nathan Seiberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14434v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories. The Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry is broken to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.
