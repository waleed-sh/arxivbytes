## 0. Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of   vacuum decay

**Authors:** Alexander C. Jenkins, Hiranya V. Peiris, Andrew Pontzen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829v1)

**Summary:**

Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. These boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory.

## 1. Quantum maximally symmetric space-times

**Authors:** Pedro Meert, Andrea Giusti, Roberto Casadio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02786v1)

**Summary:**

We show that 4-dimensional maximally symmetric spacetimes can be obtained from a coherent state quantisation of gravity. A possible connection with the central charge in the AdS/CFT correspondence is also noted. We show that geometries that approach the Minkowski vacuum exponentially away from the radius of curvature. We also show that a 4- dimensional maximally symmetry-rich spacetime can be created from a 3-dimensional symmetric Spacetime. We conclude that the 4-D Spacetimes are the most symmetric 4-dimensions.

## 2. Interpreting gravitational fields of Topologically Massive Gravity using   geodesic deviation

**Authors:** Matus Papajcik, Jiri Podolsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02772v1)

**Summary:**

We study relative motion of nearby test particles in Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) in three spacetime dimensions. We show that, in a suitable reference frame, the influence of any gravitational field can be decomposed into transverse, longitudinal, and Newtonian components. The influence of the cosmological constant manifests itself as an isotropic effect. We also discuss the physical interpretation of spacetimes of specific algebraic types and influence of various matter fields, namely pure radiation, perfect fluid, and electromagnetic field.

## 3. Is the CMB revealing signs of pre-inflationary physics?

**Authors:** Suddhasattwa Brahma, Jaime Calderón-Figueroa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02746v1)

**Summary:**

We point out the possibility of reconciling fundamental particle-physics models of inflation with data by considering non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions for primordial density perturbations. Given the latest observational constraints coming from the joint analyses of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the Planck Satellite and other missions, we point out that it is possible to reconcile the two models at the same time. We will publish our findings in a forthcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 4. Symmetry protected topological wire in a topological vacuum

**Authors:** Subrata Pachhal, Adhip Agarwala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02745v1)

**Summary:**

Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. We show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase.

## 5. Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic   topological order

**Authors:** Shang-Qiang Ning, Yang Qi, Chenjie Wang, Zheng-Cheng Gu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02736v1)

**Summary:**

Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities. The origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO) This could offer potential insights into the origins of parityviolation in the standard model. We also discuss a general framework to study theESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.

## 6. Complex Langevin Simulations of Supersymmetric Theories

**Authors:** Anosh Joseph, Arpith Kumar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02660v1)

**Summary:**

Complex Langevin Method (CLM) is a stochastic quantization technique designed to address the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions. Review examines the applications of CLM across a range of models, including zero- and two-dimensional systems, supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and the IKKT matrix model, a candidate for non-perturbative string theory. Future directions, including higher-dimensional applications and benchmarking against quantum simulations, underscore the potential ofCLM to advance both theoretical understanding and computational methodologies.

## 7. The early universe is $\textit{ACT}$-ing $\textit{warm}$

**Authors:** Arjun Berera, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Zizang Qiu, Rudnei O. Ramos, Gabriel S. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02655v1)

**Summary:**

Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. We argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. We show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms.

## 8. Black Holes, Moduli Stabilisation and the Swampland

**Authors:** Matilda Delgado, Sébastien Reymond, Thomas Van Riet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02645v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02645v1)

**Summary:**

In theories with moduli, extremal black holes behave such that for generic initial conditions, the distance traveled by the scalars from infinity to the horizon can grow with the size of the black hole. This, in turn, implies that larger black holes can probe more of the UV ingredients of the theory, in contrast with (naive) EFT expectations. We relate this discrepancy to the lack of cosmological moduli stabilisation. We are led to speculate that needing UV physics to allow for non-local effects near the horizon of large black holes is at odds with having a rigid compactification.

## 9. One-loop correction to primordial tensor modes during radiation era

**Authors:** Markus B. Fröb, Dražen Glavan, Paolo Meda, Ignacy Sawicki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02609v1)

**Summary:**

The ability to infer properties of primordial inflation relies on the conservation of the superhorizon perturbations between their exit during inflation, and their re-entry during radiation era. Any considerable departure from this property would require reinterpreting the data. We model the plasma by free photons in a thermal state and compute the one-loop correction to the power spectrum. This correction grows in time and is not suppressed by any small parameter. The result is not reliable because it invalidates perturbation theory, it signals potentially interesting effects that should be investigated further.

## 10. Unified Equation for Massless Spin Particles and New Spin Coefficient   Definitions

**Authors:** Zhong-Heng Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02592v1)

**Summary:**

The field equations for massless particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2 in arbitrary black hole spacetimes can be described by a single unified equation. This is the first discovery that these spin coefficients are interconnected through a generating function. The work will inevitably prompt a re-examination of the shared characteristics among various types of particles in black holespacetimes. It lays a solid foundation for studying the behavior of massless spin particles in any black hole background.

## 11. Generating Function of Loop Reduction by Baikov Representation

**Authors:** Chang Hu, Wen-Di Li, Xiang Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02573v1)

**Summary:**

The Baikov formalism offers a more structured and transparent framework, especially well suited for analyzing the reduction problem. In a variety of nontrivial cases the generating functions can be explicitly computed in closed form, often involving hypergeometric or elementary functions. These analytic expressions signifi cantly simplify the determination of reduction coefficients and enhance their interpretability. The results demonstrate the practicality and potential of this approach, suggesting that it can serve as a powerful and flexible tool in modern Feynman integral reduction.

## 12. Gravitational Wave with Domain Wall Dominance

**Authors:** Sungwoo Hong, Sung Mook Lee, Qiuyue Liang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02462v1)

**Summary:**

 Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken. Long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources.

## 13. All-loop effective potential for arbitrary scalar models in curved   space-time

**Authors:** V. A. Filippov, R. M. Iakhibbaev, D. M. Tolkachev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02418v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02418v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we calculate the leading divergences of the effective potential for an arbitrary scalar theory on a curved spacetime background. Based on the recurrence relation between the leading poles following from the locality condition, we obtain a system of generalised renormalisation-group equations that can be studied numerically or analytically in some special cases. We study the simplest effective potentials for power-like models and give a comparison of them in the framework of cosmological phenomenology.

## 14. Quantization of massive fermions in vacuum and external fields

**Authors:** Maxim Dvornikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02365v1)

**Summary:**

We study massive Majorana neutrinos in background matter. Representing these particles in terms of Weyl spinors, we carry out their quantization. The propagators of these fields are also constructed. Then, we apply the Hamilton dynamics based formalism to describe these neutrino in matter on the classical level. Finally, we study a classical Dirac particle in vacuum, described with $c$-number variables, within the Hamiton formalism. Such a Dirac field is also canonically quantized.

## 15. Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory

**Authors:** Sourav Chatterjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348v1)

**Summary:**

Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Timelike field theory is a version of Liouville where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign. This makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) LiouVILLE field theory. Such a theory is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition"

## 16. An exact five dimensional Weyl-Geometry Gauss-Bonnet Black Hole

**Authors:** Sebastian Bahamonde, Máximo Bañados

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02230v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02230v1)

**Summary:**

Euclidean sector defines a fully regular metric coupled to the Weyl vector field. The Euclidean action and entropy are computed, with the latter following the simple $A/4$ form plus a term linear in the horizon radius. We present a new exact black hole solution of a 5-dimensional Weyl-geometry Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity. It is based on the theory of gravitational waves, which has been used to explain the universe's curvature.
