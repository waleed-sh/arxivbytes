## 0. Response of Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum to deformations of rugby-ball   compact space

**Authors:** Hajime Otsuka, Yutaka Sakamura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13736v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the response of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass spectrum to various deformations of the rugby-ball background in 6-dimensional supergravity. We find that the mass-splitting between bosonic and fermionic modes is much smaller than the deviation from the values of the supersymmetric mass eigenvalues. We clarify some qualitative features of the spectrum deformation for some perturbations ofThe rugby- ball background. We derived the mode equations that contain the 3-dimensional scale factor and the lapse function. We numerically evaluate the KK masses for a bulk scalar and a spinor.

## 1. A new scale anomaly in Dirac matter

**Authors:** Matteo Baggioli, Maxim N. Chernodub, Karl Landsteiner, Alessandro Principi, María A. H. Vozmediano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13712v1)

**Summary:**

In 3D materials, Coulomb interactions induce a conformal anomaly associated to the charge renormalization already known in quantum field theory. The anomaly modifies the propagation speed of hydrodynamic sound waves, alters the thermodynamic equation of state, and induces a non-vanishing bulk viscosity proportional to the beta function of the Fermi velocity. We analyze the anomaly and explore its thermodynamic and hydrod dynamic consequences. The case of graphene is particularly interesting, we say.

## 2. On the Sign of the Casimir Force Between Two Bodies Coupled to a Dirac   field

**Authors:** Aitor Fernández, César D. Fosco, Guillermo Hansen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13682v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13682v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the result of Kenneth and I. Klich, Phys. Rev. Lett.97, 160401 (2006) to derive a theorem for two objects coupled to a Dirac field. We demonstrate that a sufficient condition for the Casimir interaction to be repulsive, is for their geometric configuration to be odd under the same reflection operation considered in that work. We show that this condition is the same as the one for the Dirac interaction. We conclude that this is the reason for the repulsive interaction.

## 3. Noncommutative effective field theories and the large $N$ correspondence

**Authors:** Alastair Hamilton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13678v1)

**Summary:**

We integrate the notion of an effective field theory, as described by Costello, with the framework of noncommutative symplectic geometry. We explain how in this setting, the large $N$ correspondence discovered by 't Hooft appears as a relation between noncommuttative and commutative effective field theories. As an example, we apply this framework to study a noncommUTative analogue of Chern-Simons theory. We provide a definition for the renormalization group flow in noncommotative geometry that is defined through the use of ribbon graphs.

## 4. Proton Structure Functions from Holographic Einstein-Dilaton Models

**Authors:** Ayrton da Cruz Pereira do Nascimento, Henrique Boschi-Filho, Jorge Noronha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13649v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13649v1)

**Summary:**

We study the proton structure functions $F_1$ and $F-2$ in the context of holography. We develop a general framework that extends previous holographic calculations. We focus on a choice of the dilaton potential that leads to a holographic model able to reproduce known lattice QCD results for the glueball masses at zero temperature and pure Yang-Mills thermodynamics above deconfinement. We introduce probe fermionic and gauge fields in the bulk to determine the corresponding structure functions.

## 5. On the Present Status of Inflationary Cosmology

**Authors:** Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13646v1)

**Summary:**

We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory. We discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors. We describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data. We also describe the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s]$ and $r$..

## 6. Spectrum of BPS black holes in $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$

**Authors:** Matthew Heydeman, Xiaoyi Shi, Gustavo J. Turiaci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13618v1)

**Summary:**

We uncover novel features in the spectrum of BPS and near-BPS states in asymptotically $AdS_3 $ spacetimes. This follows from a careful analysis of semiclassical and quantum black holes in this theory. We construct a family of non-extremal supersymmetric black holes that contribute to a supersymmetry index yet possess a temperature-dependent free energy. Analogous results apply to six-dimensional black holes with near-horizon geometries constructed in M-theory compactifications.

## 7. Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes

**Authors:** Minjae Cho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13609v1)

**Summary:**

We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. We formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positive and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model.

## 8. String-Membrane-Nets from Higher-Form Gauging: An Alternate Route to   $p$-String Condensation

**Authors:** Pranay Gorantla, Abhinav Prem, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Dominic J. Williamson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13604v1)

**Summary:**

We show that gauging a 1-form symmetry in 3+1D that is generated by Abelian anyons in isotropic stacks of 2-1D topological orders naturally results in a $p$-string condensed phase. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly in both field theories and lattice models. This perspective naturally generalizes to spatial dimensions $d \geq 2$ and provides a step towards building an algebraic theory of $p $-string condensation. We present a new perspective on the $ p$- string condensation procedure for constructing 3+ 1D fracton phases.

## 9. Constraints are not enough

**Authors:** Gary T. Horowitz, Donald Marolf, Jorge E. Santos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13600v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13600v1)

**Summary:**

The Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action is well-known to be unbounded below. A variety of works since the late 1980's have suggested that this problem disappears when one fixes a foliation of the spacetime and imposes the corresponding gravitational constraints. We show that this approach fails with various classes of boundary conditions imposed on the foliation. We also discuss the idea of fixing the scalar curvature and Wick-rotating the conformal factor, and show that it also fails to produce an action bounded from below.

## 10. Magnetised Bounds for Conformal Field Theories

**Authors:** Christopher P. Herzog, William H. Pannell, Biswajit Sahoo, Andreas Stergiou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13592v1)

**Summary:**

Aspects of parity-preserving, three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with a global $U(1)$ symmetry are investigated. A local effective action is constructed to four-derivative order, based on an assumption that the magnetic field drives the theory into a gapped phase. Dispersive arguments are developed and shown to impose powerful constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the effective action. These general results are further examined through explicit calculations in the free complex scalar, free Dirac fermion, and a holographic Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell model.

## 11. Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Samuel Sánchez López, José Jaime Terente Díaz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum. The spectrum could provide information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. The spectral density may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational wave experiments. It is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. The potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.

## 12. Constraining Reheating Temperature, Inflaton-SM Coupling and Dark Matter   Mass in Light of ACT DR6 Observations

**Authors:** Rajesh Mondal, Sourav Mondal, Ayan Chakraborty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13387v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13387v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the phenomenological implications of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 observations. By solving the Boltzmann equations, we derive bounds on key reheating parameters, including the reheating temperature. We analyze dark matter (DM) production through purely gravitational interactions during reheating. Our results highlight the constraining power of next-generation CMB datasets on inflationary dynamics, reheating, and the DM parameter space. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 13. Principal 3-Bundles with Adjusted Connections

**Authors:** Gianni Gagliardo, Christian Saemann, Roberto Tellez-Dominguez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13368v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the notion of adjusted connection for principal 3-bundles. These connections appear in a number of context within high-energy physics. We define a notion of categorified torus that forms an adjusted 2-crossed module, which we hope to be useful in lifting T-duality to M-theory. We list local examples arising in gauged supergravity and a global example arising in various contexts in string/M-Theory. Our primary motivation, however, stems from U-dualism.

## 14. Signature change as phase transition in holography

**Authors:** Marcelo Botta Cantcheff

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13349v1)

**Summary:**

In holographic quantum gravity, Euclidean pieces of the spacetime appear in the large N limit as representing semi-classical states of the theory. In this essay, we argue that the duals of entangled states are spacetime geometries that contain Euclideans regions in order to preserve classical connectivity. Thereby, the proposal is to extend the ER-EPR conjecture to regimes whether wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridges) become unstable but the entangled structure of the dual state persists.

## 15. Monoidal categorification of genus zero skein algebras

**Authors:** Dylan G. L. Allegretti, Hyun Kyu Kim, Peng Shan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13332v1)

**Summary:**

We prove a conjecture of the first and third named authors relating the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a genus zero surface with boundary to a quantized $K$-theoretic Coulomb branch. As a consequence, we see that our algebra arises as the Grothendieck ring of the bounded derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima variety of triples. We thus give a monoidal categorification of the skewin algebra, partially answering a question posed by D. Thurston.

## 16. Polarization modes of gravitational waves in general symmetric   teleparallel gravity

**Authors:** Yu-Qi Dong, Xiao-Bin Lai, Yu-Zhi Fan, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13298v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the polarization modes of gravitational waves within the most general symmetric teleparallel gravity theory. We consider both scenarios where test particles either carry or do not carry a hypermomentum charge. The study reveals that, within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework, it is crucial to assume that matter fields are independent of the connection, as any dependence would lead to unphysical results. We also analyze the polarization mode in two widely studied special theories: $f-Q theory and quadratic non-metricity theory.

## 17. Black Holes with Global Monopoles in 4D Noncommutative Einstein Gauss   Bonnet Gravity

**Authors:** B. Hamil

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13286v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we construct an exact spherically symmetric black hole solution with a global monopole in the context of noncommutative Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We also analyze thermodynamics and thermal stability by computing the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. The heat capacity exhibits divergences that signal second-order phase transitions. Finally, we analyze quasinormal modes or scalar perturbations, we compute them via the 6th-order WKB method, and compare them to the shadow radius methods in the eikonal limit.

## 18. Topology and the Infrared Structure of Quantum Electrodynamics

**Authors:** J. Gamboa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13247v1)

**Summary:**

We study infrared divergences in quantum electrodynamics using geometric phases and the adiabatic approximation in quantum field theory. Unlike the Faddeev--Kulish formalism, which employs perturbative dressing with coherent states, our approach reformulates the effective action in terms of Berry connections in field space. This yields finite, gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes without requiring a sum over soft-photon emissions. As an application, we study the formation of positronium in the infrared regime and argue that the dressed \(S\)-matrix exhibits a functional singularity at 4 m_e^2.

## 19. Multiple-Order Tensor Field Theory: Enumeration of unitary invariant   observables

**Authors:** Joseph Ben Geloun, Arnauld Solente

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13236v1)

**Summary:**

In Tensor Field Theory (TFT), observables are defined through tensor field contractions. Traditionally, these observables were constructed using tensor fields of a fixed order $d$. Here, we propose an extended theoretical framework for TFT. We then establish a comprehensive group-theoretic formalism that enables the systematic enumeration of these complex TFT observables. This approach encompasses existing counting methods and therefore recovers known results in specific limiting cases. We provide computational tools to facilitate the enumerations of these invariants.

## 20. Finite $N$ Bulk Hilbert Space in ETH Matrix Model for double-scaled SYK

**Authors:** Masamichi Miyaji, Soichiro Mori, Kazumi Okuyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13194v1)

**Summary:**

The chord number in the strict large $N$ DSSYK model is known to correspond to the discrete length of the Einstein-Rosen bridge in the gravity dual. At finite $N$, these chord number states can be constructed but form an overcomplete basis of the non-perturbative Hilbert space. The structure of the inner product gets significantly modified due to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem: There are infinitely many null states. The constructed chord number operator depends on the reference chord number state, it realizes approximate $q$-deformed oscillator algebra and reproduces semiclassical bulk geometry.

## 21. Hypergeometric Discriminants

**Authors:** Saiei-Jaeyeong Matsubara-Heo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13163v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a hypergeometric system associated with a flat family of very affine locally complete intersection varieties. It is proven that the Euler discriminant locus is its singular locus and is purely one-codimensional unless it is empty. Of particular interest is a family ofvery affine hypersurfaces. We coin the termhypergeometric discriminant for the characteristic variety of the hypergeometrical system. We establish a formula in terms of likelihood equations to explain the system.

## 22. On consistency of the interacting (anti)holomorphic higher-spin sector

**Authors:** A. V. Korybut

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13125v1)

**Summary:**

In the recently proposed generating systems for the (anti)holomorphic sector of the 4d higher spin theory, locality was achieved due to a peculiar limiting star product. Even though the generating systems exhibit all-order locality, the product itself encounters uncertainties when functions from specific classes are multiplied. This fact leads to the absence of the Leibniz rule for the differential operator acting on the auxiliary variables $z$ and, hence, its ambiguous definition in the generating equations. Nonetheless considered generating systems are perfectly consistent as shown by direct computations on the resulting vertices.

## 23. Fermionic sub-GeV Dark Matter from evaporating Primordial Black Holes at   DarkSide-50

**Authors:** The DarkSide-50 Collaboration, :, P. Agnes, I. F. Albuquerque, T. Alexander, A. K. Alton, M. Ave, H. O. Back, G. Batignani, K. Biery, V. Bocci, W. M. Bonivento, B. Bottino, S. Bussino, M. Cadeddu, M. Cadoni, R. Calabrese, F. Calaprice, A. Caminata, N. Canci, M. Caravati, N. Cargioli, M. Cariello, M. Carlini, P. Cavalcante, S. Chashin, A. Chepurnov, M. Chianese, D. D'Angelo, S. Davini, S. De Cecco, A. V. Derbin, M. D'Incecco, C. Dionisi, F. Dordei, M. Downing, G. Fiorillo, D. Franco, F. Gabriele, C. Galbiati, C. Ghiano, C. Giganti, G. K. Giovanetti, A. M. Goretti, G. Grilli di Cortona, A. Grobov, M. Gromov, M. Guam, M. Gulino, B. R. Hackett, K. Herner, T. Hessel, F. Hubaut, E. V. Hungerford, A. Ianni, V. Ippolito, K. Keeter, C. L. Kendziora, M. Kimura, I. Kochanek, D. Korablev, G. Korga, A. Kubankin, M. Kuss, M. La Commara, M. Lai, X. Li, M. Lissia, O. Lychagina, I. N. Machulin, L. P. Mapelli, S. M. Mari, J. Maricic, A. Messina, R. Milincic, J. Monroe, M. Morrocchi, V. N. Muratova, P. Musico, A. O. Nozdrina, A. Oleinik, F. Ortica, L. Pagani, M. Pallavicini, L. Pandola, E. Pantic, E. Paoloni, K. Pelczar, N. Pelliccia, S. Piacentini, A. Pocar, M. Poehlmann, S. Pordes, S. S. Poudel, P. Pralavorio, D. Price, F. Ragusa, M. Razeti, A. L. Renshaw, M. Rescigno, J. Rode, A. Romani, D. Sablone, O. Samoylov, S. Sanfilippo, C. Savarese, N. Saviano, B. Schlitzer, D. A. Semenov, A. Shchagin, A. Sheshukov, M. D. Skorokhvatov, O. Smirnov, A. Sotnikov, S. Stracka, Y. Suvorov, R. Tartaglia, G. Testera, A. Tonazzo, E. V. Unzhakov, A. Vishneva, R. B. Vogelaar, M. Wada, H. Wang, Y. Wang, S. Westerdale, M. M. Wojcik, X. Xiao, C. Yang, G. Zuzel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13093v1)

**Summary:**

We present a search for boosted dark matter from Primordial Black Holes (PBH) evaporation using the DarkSide-50 ionization-signal-only dataset. The absence of a signal enables setting complementary limits to those derived from cosmological observations and direct detection searches for cosmic ray-boosted dark matter. We focus on PBHs with masses in the range [$10^{14},\,10^{16}$] g producing Dirac fermionic dark matter particles with sub-GeV kinetic energy.

## 24. Thermodynamic parameters of fluids on conformally connected spacetimes

**Authors:** Bhera Ram, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13084v1)

**Summary:**

Local thermal equilibrium generally implies the absence of heat flux within a fluid. We find the relations between a set of thermodynamic variables of a fluid on a general spacetime and those defined on a conformally connected spacetime. The scaling relations appear to be consistent with Dicke's heuristic argument and the previous analysis done on the basis of various restrictions. These relations are further shown to preserve the geometric structure of thermodynamics, known as geometrothermodynamics. This provides an alternative consistency check as well as a distinct geometric interpretation of the relations.

## 25. RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves

**Authors:** Katsuya Hashino, Daiki Ueda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. We revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalized uncertainties.

## 26. Hamiltonian renormalisation IX. U(1)**3 quantum gravity

**Authors:** M. Rodriguez Zarate, T. Thiemann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13037v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonian renormalisation of the U(1)**3 model for Euclidian general relativity in four spacetime dimensions which is self-interacting. The Hamiltonian flow needs as an input a choice of *-algebra and corresponding representation thereof or state on it at each resolution scale. If one uses as input the algebras and states that were used in the recent exact solutions of this model, then one finds that the flow is rapidly fixed pointed. In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormisation of free field theories in all spacetime Dimensions.

## 27. Hamiltonian renormalisation VIII. P(Phi,2) quantum field theory

**Authors:** M. Rodriguez Zarate, T. Thiemann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13030v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the self-interacting scalar field in two spacetime dimensions with polynomial potential. We consider only the finite volume case. The P(Phi,2) theory is one of the few interacting QFT's that can be rigorously constructed non-perturbatively. We find that our Hamiltonianrenormalisation flow finds this theory indeed as a fixed point. In previous works in this series we focussed on the renormalization of free field theories in all spacetime Dimensions.

## 28. Holographic Einstein Ring of AdS Reissner Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m Black Holes   with Euler Heisenberg Nonlinear Electrodynamics

**Authors:** Abhishek Baruah, Prabwal Phukon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13018v1)

**Summary:**

This study employs wave optics methods to investigate the Einstein ring structure of quantum corrected AdS Reissner Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black holes. A wave source placed on the AdS boundary yields a response function on the antipodal side, from which a virtual optical system with a convex lens reconstructs the holographic image. As the observer's position varies, the image transitions from a complete ring to an arc and eventually to a single bright point. The results highlight how nonlinear electromagnetic effects and bulk field configurations manifest in observable boundary features.

## 29. Stark Energy Shifts due to Quantum Gravity in RGUP Algebra

**Authors:** Gaurav Bhandari, S. D. Pathak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12985v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the Stark effect in the hydrogen atom under an external electric field. We incorporate relativistic generalized uncertainty principle (RGUP) corrections within Minkowskian spacetime. The perturbed Hamiltonian, modified by RGUP, enfold quantum gravitational effects. These findings reduce to standard Stark effect results and non-relativistic GUP frameworks in the limits of the GUP framework. We establish our model as a generalized framework for analyzing minimal length effects in quantum systems.

## 30. Experimental Particle Physics Priorities 2025: A String Phenomenology   Perspective

**Authors:** Jonathan DeMont, Alon E. Faraggi, Mark Goodsell, Marco Guzzi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12965v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12965v1)

**Summary:**

String theory provides a perturbatively consistent framework for quantum gravity. String phenomenology aims to connect between string theory and observational data. We propose that the experimental particle physics priority is the nature of the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. An ideal facility in the near future to study this sector is a hadron collider at 50--60 TeV that utilises contemporary magnet technology and can be built in 10--15 years from decision.

## 31. On Folding Calabi-Yau Diagrams in M-theory Black Brane Scenarios

**Authors:** Adil Belhaj, Abderrahim Bouhouch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12948v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we reconsider the study of five-dimensional supersymmetric black branes in the context of the M-theory compactification. Combining colored graph theory and outer-automorphism group action techniques, we approach the tetra-quadric Calabi-Yau diagram leading to new features. Using a procedure referred to as folding, we show that the compactifications can be reduced to known compactifications with lower dimensional K\"{a}hler moduli spaces.

## 32. Basis light-front quantization approach to deuteron

**Authors:** Chandan Mondal, Satvir Kaur, Jiatong Wu, Siqi Xu, Xingbo Zhao, James P. Vary

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12889v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12889v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain the deuteron's wave functions as eigenstates of the light-front quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Hamiltonian using a fully relativistic and nonperturbative approach based on light- front quantization. This highlights the significant role of hidden color components in the QCD description of nuclear structure. Our results reveal that while the singlet-singlet state is present, the hidden color states collectively dominate, contributing a larger probability to thedeuteron wave function.

## 33. AdS-GNN -- a Conformally Equivariant Graph Neural Network

**Authors:** Maksim Zhdanov, Nabil Iqbal, Erik Bekkers, Patrick Forré

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12880v1)

**Summary:**

Conformal symmetries, i.e. coordinate transformations that preserve angles, play a key role in many fields, including physics, mathematics, computer vision and (geometric) machine learning. Here we build a neural network that is equivariant under general conformal transformations. We employ message-passing layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient framework. We validate our model on tasks fromComputer vision and statistical physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities, and the ability to extract conformal data from the trained network.

## 34. What Price Fiber Bundle Substantivalism? On How to Avoid Holes in Fibers

**Authors:** Philipp Berghofer, Jordan François, Lucrezia Ravera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876v1)

**Summary:**

Gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories are formulated in a framework based on the differential geometry of connections on principal bundles. After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories. It formally implements the point- coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (d dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.

## 35. On classification of (self-dual) higher-spin gravities in flat space

**Authors:** Mattia Serrani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12839v1)

**Summary:**

There is a great number of higher-spin gravities in $3d$ that can have both finite and infinite spectra of fields and can be formulated as Chern-Simons theories. It was believed that this is impossible in higher dimensions, where higher- Spin fields do have propagating degrees of freedom. We show that there are infinitely many higher- spin theories in the $4d$ flat space featuring nontrivial local interactions. We classify all one- and two-derivativehigher-spin theories by solving the holomorphic constraint in the light-cone gauge obtained by Metsaev.

## 36. Holographic composite Higgs model and gravitational waves produced   during first order phase transition

**Authors:** Andrey A. Shavrin

**Summary:**

The soft-wall holographic composite Higgs model assumes first-order phase transition from the dynamical inner symmetry breaking. This research focuses on the implications of the semi-analytical perturbative solution of the dual 5-dimensional theory. We clarify the thermodynamical description and gravitational waves spectrum produced during the phase transition, which were previously numerically estimated. Besides, we investigate the limits of the applicability of our solution within the thin-wall approximation and quasiclassical approach.

## 37. Super-entropic black holes in gravity's rainbow and determining   constraints on rainbow functions

**Authors:** Behzad Eslam Panah, Narges Heidari, Mana Soleimani, Maryam Kaveh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13555v1)

**Summary:**

This paper is motivated by the application of the inverse isoperimetric inequality to establish constraints on the parameters of gravity's rainbow. We investigate the thermodynamic (in)stability conditions for $d-$dimensional energy-dependent black holes. By considering a constraint on the rainbow function, we show that these black holes satisfy the super-entropic condition. We assess the physical and stable regions by utilizing these thermodynamic quantities alongside the inverting isoperiative inequality, aiming to determine constraints on rainbow functions.

## 38. Spin-weighted spherical harmonics as total angular momentum eigenstates   for massless particles and their role in obstructing spin-orbital   decompositions

**Authors:** Eric Palmerduca, Hong Qin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12765v1)

**Summary:**

We show that for massless particles of helicity $h$, the angular momentum eigenstates are given in an appropriate coordinate system by the spin-weighted spherical harmonics. The resultant angular momentum multiplet structure is quite different than that of massive particles, with $|h|$ acting as a lower bound on $J^2$ and at most one multiplet for each angular momentum $j$. This illustrates the obstruction to a spin-orbital decomposition of the angular Momentum.

## 39. A Charged and Neutral Spin-$4$ Currents in the Grassmannian-like Coset   Model

**Authors:** Changhyun Ahn, Minsu Kang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12708v1)

**Summary:**

Primary charged spin-$4$ current occurs at the first order pole of this OPE for generic parameters. We determine the OPE between the charged Spin-$2$ current and the chargedspin-$3$ current. The infinity limit of the level $k$ (one of the parameters) is also given for this O PE. We also check that the above primary charged and neutral Spin-$4 $ currents occur at the second order poles of the O PE for fixed parameters. For example, the primary neutral spin-$3 $ current is found to occur in the second place of the operator product expansion (OPE)
