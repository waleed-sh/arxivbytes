## 0. Topological Quantum Dark Matter via Global Anomaly Cancellation

**Authors:** Juven Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21319v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21319v1)

**Summary:**

Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number. We propose anomalous sectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. Key implications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via discrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with gapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological leptogenesis.

## 1. The quantum Newton's bucket: Active and passive rotations in quantum   theory

**Authors:** Augusto Facundes da Silva, Kayman Jhosef Goncalves, Giorgio Torrieri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21298v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the difference between "active'' and "passive" rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory. We conclude with a look at the implications of our findings for the theory of heavy ion collisions in the quantum world. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 2. Reconstruction of spider system's observables from orbital period   modulations via the Applegate mechanism

**Authors:** Vittorio De Falco, Amodio Carleo, Alessandro Ridolfi, Alessandro Corongiu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21283v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21283v1)

**Summary:**

Redback and black widow pulsars are two classes of peculiar binary systems. Long-term timing revealed systematic but unpredictable variations in the orbital period. This can most likely be explained by the so-called Applegate mechanism. This relies on the magnetic dynamo activity generated inside the companion star and triggered by the pulsar wind, which induces a modification of the star's oblateness (or quadrupole variation) This, in turn, couples with the orbit by gravity, causing a consequent change in the orbit.

## 3. Quantum information elements in Quantum Gravity states and processes

**Authors:** Daniele Oriti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21234v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum gravity states and processes share a purely combinatorial and algebraic language, and a discrete geometric interpretation. We emphasize how, in this context, entanglement is a seed of topological and geometric properties. A pre-geometric, discrete notion of quantum causality can be implemented, as well as some recent results on the conditions for information transmission and holographic behaviour in quantum gravity states. Together, these features indicate that quantum information concepts and tools play a key role in defining the fundamental structure of quantum spacetime.

## 4. The momentum-space conformal bootstrap in 2d

**Authors:** Marc Gillioz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21227v1)

**Summary:**

A new bootstrap equation in 2-dimensional conformal field theory is derived starting from the momentum-space representation of the correlation functions. Since Wightman functions are not crossing-symmetric, the analyticity properties of the commutator are leveraged instead to obtain a relation between two distinct operator product expansions. The procedure requires evaluating a 4-point function with two light-like momenta. The result is an asymmetric equation valid for arbitrary theories in 1d and 2d.

## 5. $SO(10)$ theory on the plateau: the importance of being renormalizable

**Authors:** Anca Preda, Goran Senjanović, Michael Zantedeschi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21180v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21180v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit a minimal renormalisable $SO(10)$ grand unified theory. We find that it allows for the Left-Right symmetric scale to be accessible even at the LHC. The Quark-Lepton unification scale as low as its phenomenological limit around $10^5\,$GeV. We also discuss a recently raised issue of the fine-tuning of the light Higgs mass and its potential conflict with low intermediate mass scales. The paper is published by Oxford University Press.

## 6. Spinning boson stars in nonlinear sigma models and Universal Relations

**Authors:** Christoph Adam, Jorge Castelo Mourelle, Alberto García Martín-Caro, Andrzej Wereszczynski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923v1)

**Summary:**

Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions.

## 7. Constraining Anisotropic Universe Through Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: A   Case Study of The Bianchi Type-I Universe

**Authors:** Jiwon Park, Sourav Mridha, Dukjae Jang, Mayukh R. Gangopadhyay, Myung-Ki Cheoun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20893v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20893v1)

**Summary:**

The isotropy and homogeneity of our Universe are the cardinal principles of modern cosmology. The presence of anisotropy, inhomogeneity, or both are allowed in the metrics defined as the Bianchi type I and V metrics. In this letter, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism, and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on the global an isotropy offered in the Bian Chi type I metrics. This will provide a new path to explore in the background of global anIsotropy.

## 8. Hamiltonian Neural Networks approach to fuzzball geodesics

**Authors:** Andrea Cipriani, Alessandro De Santis, Giorgio Di Russo, Alfredo Grillo, Luca Tabarroni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20881v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations, say the researchers. The study looked at planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. The research was published in the open-access journal, Theoretical Physics.

## 9. Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter

**Authors:** Mayank, K. Hari, Subhajit Barman, Dawood Kothawala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874v1)

**Summary:**

The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe with "effective" acceleration $q. However, no such mapping generically exists for theEntanglement between probes. We obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes.

## 10. Solitonic vortices and black holes with vortex hair in AdS$_3$

**Authors:** Roberto Auzzi, Stefano Bolognesi, Giuseppe Nardelli, Gianni Tallarita, Nicolò Zenoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20822v1)

**Summary:**

We study soliton and black hole solutions with scalar hair in a theory with a Maxwell field and a charged scalar field with double trace boundary conditions. We investigate the phase diagram as a function of the temperature $T$ and of the double trace coupling $kappa$ We find a rich pattern of phase transitions, which can be of the Hawking-Page kind or can be due to the condensation of the order parameter. The Little-Park periodicity is realized for the dual of the black hole solution with hair as a shift in the winding number and in the gauge field.

## 11. Is chiral supersymmetry emanant or emergent?

**Authors:** Yu Nakayama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20815v1)

**Summary:**

Extended Majorana Nicolai model is one of the simplest models of supersymmetry realized on a fermionic chain in $1+1$ dimensions. Within a certain parameter region, the extended theory breaks the supers asymmetry spontaneously, but it has a distinguished feature that the general counting rule of the Nambu-Goldstone mode does not apply. We observe twice as many low-energy degrees of freedom than the broken lattice symmetry. We argue that the extra degrees offreedom originate from the spontaneous breaking of the emergent chiral supersymmetric.

## 12. Performing integration-by-parts reductions using NeatIBP 1.1 + Kira

**Authors:** Zihao Wu, Janko Böhm, Rourou Ma, Johann Usovitsch, Yingxuan Xu, Yang Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20778v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20778v1)

**Summary:**

A Kira interface is included. It allows the user to reduce the integration-by-parts (IBP) identity systems generated by NeatIBP using Kira in a highly automated way. This new version also implements the so-called spanning cuts method, which helps reduce the total computational complexity of IBP reduction for certain hard problems. Another important feature of this new version is an algorithm to simplify the solution module of the syzygy equations hinted by the idea of maximal cuts. We introduce a new version v1.1 of Neat IBP.

## 13. On the nonlinearity of Four-Dimensional Conformal Transformations in   spinor representation

**Authors:** Zhi-Peng Wang, X. X. Yi, Hai-Jun Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20776v1)

**Summary:**

Nonlinearity of the conformal group is an essential factor that ruins the global conformal invariance for interacting material fields. In this paper we attempt to track such nonlinearity from spacetime transformations to spinor representations. To this end we rederive the spinor representation by generalizing the linear fractional transformation from two dimensions to four dimensions via replacing complex numbers with biquaternions. These two transformations do not lead to nonlinear terms in Yukawa term, but do in vector-spinor interaction. And the non linear terms would definitely cause $CP$ violation.

## 14. Classification of Modular Symmetries in Type IIB Flux Landscape

**Authors:** Keiya Ishiguro, Takafumi Kai, Tatsuo Kobayashi, Yuichi Koga, Hajime Otsuka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20743v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study modular symmetries in type IIB flux landscape by investigating symplectic basis transformations of period vectors on toroidal orbifolds. To fix explicit cycles of a third-cohomology basis regarding the untwisted complex structure modulus, which is necessary to construct the period vectors, we find that the following two symmetry are required for the period vector. We also explore type IIb flux vacua on toroid orientifolds and flux transformations under the modular symmeetries of theperiod vectors.
