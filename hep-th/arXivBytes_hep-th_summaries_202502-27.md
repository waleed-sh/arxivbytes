## 0. Boundary Modes in String Field Theory

**Authors:** Carlo Maccaferri, Riccardo Poletti, Alberto Ruffino, Jakub Vošmera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19373v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the construction of boundary contributions to free string field theory actions in the context of the bosonic string. We show that it is generally possible to obtain a well-defined variational principle by adding a simple boundary term to the original bulk action. By writing down a gauge-invariant action for the first massive level of the open string, we provide evidence that an analogous construction should be possible for the full tensilestring field theory. Our results reproduce linearized general relativity with the Gibbons-Hawking-York term and provide similar gauge-Invariant actions for the infinite tower of massless higher-spin gauge theories for all Regge trajectories.

## 1. The chiral SYK model in three-dimensional holography

**Authors:** Alexander Altland, Dmitry Bagrets, Nele Callebaut, Konstantin Weisenberger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19370v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19370v1)

**Summary:**

A celebrated realization of the holographic principle posits an approximate duality between the quantum mechanical SYK model and two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. We here propose a generalization of this correspondence to one dimension higher. We derive a reduction to the Alekseev-Shatashvilli (AS)-action, a minimal extension of the Schwarzian action. In the bulk, we show how the same action describes fluctuations around the Euclidean BTZ black hole configuration, the dominant stationary solution of three-dimensional gravity.

## 2. Particle production induced by a Lorentzian non-commutative spacetime

**Authors:** A. A. Araújo Filho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19366v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we examine particle production, evaporation, and greybody factors for a Lorentzian non-commutative black hole. We describe Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand metric representation. In this context, we identify the presence of a remnant mass when the black hole reaches the final stage of its evapration. Overall, compared to the Schwarzschild case ($\Theta = 0$), the absence of the non-Commutative parameter $Theta$ lowers the Hawking temperature and reduces the particle creation density.

## 3. Quantum-Corrected Gravitational Interaction Incorporated with a   Non-inertial Cosmic String Spacetime

**Authors:** M. Baradaran, L. M. Nieto, S. Zarrinkamar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19332v1)

**Summary:**

 scalar bosons are considered in a cosmic-string spacetime and in a non-inertial framework. They are involved in a generalized gravitational interaction containing both relativistic and quantum corrections. Solutions for the quantum-corrected gravitational interaction for an arbitrary state are reported in a quasi-exact manner. A discussion of the structure of the problem, whose special case appears in double confluent Heun form, is given. The results are motivated by the great interest in studying quantum and gravitational phenomena in a unified way.

## 4. Topological Susceptibility in the Superconductive Phases of Quantum   Chromodynamics: a Dyson-Schwinger Perspective

**Authors:** Fabrizio Murgana, Giorgio Comitini, Marco Ruggieri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19327v1)

**Summary:**

We test non-perturbative gluon propagators recently studied in the literature. We use the topological susceptibility of the superconductive phases of Quantum Chromodynamics at high density. We discuss implications of the results for the axion mass in superdense phases ofQuantum Chromodynamics. We complete the model by adding a $U(1)_A$-breaking term whose coupling is fixed perturbatively at large quark chemical potential. We then use the effective potential to compute $\chi$ in the super Conductive phases.

## 5. Wormhole geometries in $f\left(R,T^2\right)$ gravity satisfying the   energy conditions

**Authors:** Nailya Ganiyeva, João Luís Rosa, Francisco S. N. Lobo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19323v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19323v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the properties of traversable wormhole spacetimes within the framework of energy-momentum squared gravity. We demonstrate the existence of a wide range of wormhole solutions that satisfy all of the energy conditions without requiring fine-tuning of the model parameters. We extend our analysis to more intricate dependencies on $T^2$, demonstrating that the methodology remains applicable as long as no mixed terms between $R$ and $T ^2$ are introduced. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results.

## 6. Bosonisation and BTZ Black Hole Microstates

**Authors:** Suvankar Dutta, Shruti Menon, Aayush Srivastav

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19322v1)

**Summary:**

When the boundary dynamics of gravity is governed by the collective field theory Hamiltonian, its asymptotic symmetry algebra becomes the centerless Kac-Moody algebra. We quantize this system using the quantum bosonization of relativistic free fermions and relate these to the dynamical fields of gravity. This leads to a correspondence where different bulk configurations correspond to distinct states (particle-hole pair excitations) in the fermionic Hilbert space. This mapping allows us to construct BTZ black hole microstates.

## 7. Cosmological Magnetic Fields from Ultralight Dark Matter

**Authors:** Robert Brandenberger, Jürg Fröhlich, Hao Jiao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19310v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a mechanism for the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales. An essential ingredient is an instability (of parametric resonance type) of the electromagnetic field driven by an oscillating pseudo-scalar dark matter field. We find that magnetic fields larger than the observational lower bounds can be generated soon after recombination on scales of $1 {\rm{Mpc}}$. The mechanism is described in the article "Magnetic Fields on Cosmological Scales" published by The Astrophysical Journal.

## 8. Self-Similar Structure of Loop Amplitudes and Renormalization

**Authors:** Kang-Sin Choi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19300v1)

**Summary:**

A renormalized amplitude can be regarded as an effective coupling that recursively appears within another loop. It is a scale-dependent, finite, parametrically small and observable quantity appearing in the S-matrix. Replacing a constant coupling with a loop amplitude provides a systematic method of generating high-order loop amplitudes, guaranteeing no subamplitude divergence. This approach also provides an alternative bottom-up method to the traditional top-down recursive renormalization of general amplitudes.

## 9. The Roberge-Weiss transition for QCD in a magnetic background

**Authors:** Massimo D'Elia, Lorenzo Maio, Kevin Zambello, Giuseppe Zanichelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19294v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19294v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate how a magnetic background field influences the location and the nature of the Roberge-Weiss (RW) finite temperature transition for $N_f = 2+1$ QCD with physical quark masses. We find that the magnetic field turns the RW transition from second order to first order, with a tri-critical magnetic field in-between 1 and 2.4 GeV$^2. The drop of the chiral condensate, which signals chiral symmetry restoration, leads also to the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis above the transition.

## 10. A Tropical Look at Coisotropic Branes and Quantization

**Authors:** Emil Albrychiewicz, Andrés Franco Valiente, Vi Hong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19246v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19246v1)

**Summary:**

The tropical limit naturally decomposes conventional A-branes into two distinct classes: tropical Lagrangian branes and tropical coisotropic branes. By carefully analyzing the modified boundary conditions emerging from the tropological sigma models, we construct these tropical branes explicitly. We demonstrate their utility in an example where we quantize a symplectic manifold through the use of a tropical version of brane quantization.

## 11. Black hole solutions of three dimensional E$_{6}$-gravity

**Authors:** R. Sammani, E. H Saidi, R. Ahl Laamara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19241v1)

**Summary:**

This paper aims to construct exceptional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black holes. The black holes carry E$6$ charges as solutions to the 3D higher spin Anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity. The linear-exceptional and the ortho-exception BTZ solutions result from splitting the extremal nodes in the Tits-Satake diagram. And with the help of Hasse diagram visualizations, we study the ensuing higher spin spectrums.

## 12. Light dilaton near critical points in top-down holography

**Authors:** Daniel Elander, Antón F. Faedo, Maurizio Piai, Ronnie Rodgers, Javier G. Subils

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19226v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19226v1)

**Summary:**

A class of UV-complete, strongly coupled, confining three-dimensional field theories exhibit a novel stabilisation mechanism for the mass of the lightest scalar composite state. The theories admit a holographic dual description in terms of regular backgrounds in eleven-dimensional supergravity. Their phase diagram includes a line of first-order phase transitions ending at the critical point, where the transition becomes of second order. We identify this state as the dilaton, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance.

## 13. Chiral symmetry breaking and restoration by helical magnetic fields in   AdS/CFT

**Authors:** Martí Berenguer, Javier Mas, Masataka Matsumoto, Keiju Murata, Alfonso V. Ramallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19197v1)

**Summary:**

Helical magnetic fields can counteract uniform-field-induced symmetry breaking, driving the system towards symmetry restoration. We also find an effect analog to the chiral magnetic effect whereby the current is parallel to the magnetic field. We further study the massive case, and find that the helical configuration is less effective in erasing the first order phase transition that is present in the case of a constant magnetic field in the AdS/QCD framework. The study was conducted using the D3/D7-brane model.

## 14. Higher derivative holography and temperature dependence of QGP   viscosities

**Authors:** Thomas Apostolidis, Umut Gürsoy, Edwan Préau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19195v1)

**Summary:**

Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories. We determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data.

## 15. Proper Effective Temperature and Order Parameters in Relativistic   Non-Equilibrium Steady States

**Authors:** Shin Nakamura, Fuminori Okabayashi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19157v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the concept of temperature in non-equilibrium steady states. Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature. Our results suggest that the propereffective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativists.

## 16. Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond   Horndeski Gravity

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155v1)

**Summary:**

We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity. We argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. We discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities. Back to the page you came from.

## 17. Firewall boundaries and mixed phases of rotating quark matter in linear   sigma model

**Authors:** Sergio Morales-Tejera, Victor E. Ambruş, Maxim N. Chernodub

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19087v1)

**Summary:**

Numerical results on chiral symmetry breaking in rotating plasmas of interacting fermions reveal surprisingly close correspondence in predictions between rigorous bounded and formal unbounded approaches. We adopt three consecutive levels of approximation to the ground state of the system that feature a uniform (model 1) and weakly-inhomogeneous (model 2) and fully inhomogeneus (model 3) condensates. Models 1 and 2 that do not take into account spatial gradients of the condensate, show agreement with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law.

## 18. Plebanski complex

**Authors:** Kirill Krasnov, Adam Shaw

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19027v1)

**Summary:**

We define and study properties of what we call the Pleba\'nski complex. This is a differential complex that arises by linearisation of the equations implying that a Riemannian 4-manifold is hyper-K\"ahler. We also show that, as in the case with instanton equations, the full Einstein equations also fit into this framework. Supplemented by suitable adjoints, operators assemble into an elliptic operator that squares to the Laplacian and is given by the direct sum of two Dirac operators.

## 19. The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter

**Authors:** Romuald A. Janik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity.

## 20. Calogero-Sutherland-type quantum systems, generalized hypergeometric   functions and superintegrability for integral chain

**Authors:** Fan Liu, Rui Wang, Jie Yang, Wei-Zhong Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18921v1)

**Summary:**

We reinvestigate the Calogero-Sutherland-type (CS-type) models and generalized hypergeometric functions. We construct the generalized CS operators for circular, Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel cases and establish the generalized Lasselle-Nekrasov correspondence. We analyze the superintegrability for the $\beta$-deformed integrals, where the measures are associated with the corresponding ground state wave functions of CS models. We present their $O$-representations in terms of the $\hat O$- operator.

## 21. Interplay of ALP Couplings at a Muon Collider

**Authors:** So Chigusa, Sudhakantha Girmohanta, Yuichiro Nakai, Yufei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18912v1)

**Summary:**

Axion-like particles can couple to Standard Model gluons, electroweak gauge bosons, and massive fermions. A future multi-TeV muon collider provides a favorable environment to probe axion- like particles through multiple production channels. We explore how different axions-like particle couplings shape its production and decay modes, revealing a rich and intricate phenomenological landscape. The study was motivated by the quality issue of the QCD axion, and we focus on axions with masses and decay constants around the TeV scale.

## 22. Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to   Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling

**Authors:** Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. It could help devise quantum engines, the authors say. The work statistics of many-body systems can be challenging to calculate explicitly, they say.
