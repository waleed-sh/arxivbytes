## 0. Symplectic Grassmannian description of the Coulomb branch three and four   point amplitudes

**Authors:** Veronica Calvo Cortes, Yassine El Maazouz, Subramanya Hegde, Amit Suthar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03705v1)

**Summary:**

We present a formulation of the three- and four-point amplitudes on the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM. We demonstrate that their kinematic spaces are equivalent to symplectic Grassmannians SpGr(n,2n) We also express the six-dimensional N = (1,1) SYM amplitude in terms of four-dimensional variables in a form that makes its Grassmannian structure manifest. We show that the integral yields the amplitude up to a known kinematics factor.

## 1. Topological Manipulations On $\mathbb{R}$ Symmetries Of Abelian Gauge   Theory

**Authors:** Burak Oğuz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03700v1)

**Summary:**

Performing topological manipulations is a fruitful way to understand global aspects of Quantum Field Theory. Such modifications are controlled by the notion of Topological QFT (TQFT) coupling across different codimensions. For the TQFT coupling with $U(1)$ valued conjugate field, we demonstrate a $2\pi \mathbb{Z} \subset \Mathbb{R}$ subgroup gauging, which we connect to the results obtained from SymTFT recently.

## 2. The integrand form of infrared singularities of two-loop QCD scattering   amplitudes

**Authors:** Piotr Bargiela

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03684v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we express the singular part of a scattering amplitude in terms of Feynman integrals compatible with topologies appearing in the bare amplitude. In two-loop massless QCD, we find such a representation of the amplitude singularities using a systematic ansatz reconstruction of the integrand from a predicted integrated form. As an example application, we write the finite part of an amplitude for the digluon production in quark annihilation for some helicity configurations as manifestly locally finite.

## 3. A Centrality-independent Framework for Revealing Genuine Higher-Order   Cumulants in Heavy-Ion Collisions

**Authors:** Zhaohui Wang, Xiaofeng Luo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03666v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel centrality definition-independent method for analyzing higher-order proton cumulants, specifically addressing the challenge of volume fluctuations that dominate in low-energy heavy-ion collisions. This method reconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with parameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and Bayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model simulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including centrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that the proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained using number of participant nucleon observables.

## 4. Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from Intersecting   D6-Branes on Rigid Cycles

**Authors:** Adeel Mansha, Mudassar Sabir, Tianjun Li, Luyang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03664v1)

**Summary:**

Intersecting D6-brane models without discrete torsion typically suffer from unstabilized open string moduli. These moduli generate additional massless adjoint fields, obstructing the realization of negative beta functions necessary for asymptotic freedom unless they are decoupled around string scale. In this work, we present a class of consistent three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models. We provide detailed particle spectra, analyze their phenomenological implications, and discuss the decoupling of exotic states through strong dynamics.

## 5. Supermassive black hole in NGC 4649 (M60) with a dark matter halo:   Impact on shadow measurements and thermodynamic properties

**Authors:** Francisco S. N. Lobo, Jorde A. A. Ramos, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03661v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate black hole (BH) solutions embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo. The DM density profile is constrained by Hubble Space Telescope data, stellar dynamics, and globular cluster (GC) measurements of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60) Using this profile, we construct two distinct spacetime solutions characterized by the black hole mass ($M$), critical velocity ($V_c$), and core radius ($a$) These results underscore the role of DM in shaping both geometric and thermodynamic aspects of BHs.

## 6. Consequences of non-minimal coupling for mass mixing in spontaneous   baryogenesis

**Authors:** Mattia Dubbini, Orlando Luongo, Marco Muccino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03644v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the impact of a non-minimal Yukawa-like coupling between curvature and inflaton field within the baryogenesis background. We demonstrate that this coupling leads to a significant enhancement in particle production, even for small values of the coupling constant. As a further outcome, we find that the non-Minimal Yukwa coupling also leads to the renormalization of the inflaton mass and weakly influences the bounds over the gravitational constant. Since the fermionic fields appear not to be mass eigenstates, we specialize the mass-mixing between them only. To this end, we thus include the effects of mass- mixing and cosmic expansion into our calculations.

## 7. Keeping the relation between the Starobinsky model and no-scale   supergravity ACTive

**Authors:** Ioannis D. Gialamas, Theodoros Katsoulas, Kyriakos Tamvakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03608v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an additional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term. We analyze the inflationary predictions of the model and find that the modified model is in full agreement with the recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. For a range of $e$-folds, $N_\star = 50-60$. We find that for $-4.2 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lessSim -1.9 \times 8.9$.

## 8. Soft Theorems from Higher Symmetries

**Authors:** Jonah Berean-Dutcher, Maria Derda, Julio Parra-Martinez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03566v1)

**Summary:**

We describe the connection between spontaneously-broken higher symmetries and soft theorems for scattering amplitudes of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Our main result is a new sub-leading double soft pion theorem. We also provide a novel derivation of the leading soft photon theorem from the Ward identity of an emergent 1-form global symmetry in effective field theories where antiparticles are integrated out. We use the algebra of spacetime currents and do not rely on asymptotic symmetry or diagrammatic arguments.

## 9. Blobbed topological recursion and KP integrability

**Authors:** Alexander Alexandrov, Boris Bychkov, Petr Dunin-Barkowski, Maxim Kazarian, Sergey Shadrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03545v1)

**Summary:**

We revise the notion of the blobbed topological recursion. We show that the so-called non-perturbative differentials form a special case of this revisited version. We prove the KP integrability of the differentials for input data that include KP-integrable blobs. This result generalizes, unifies, and gives a new proof of the KP integration of nonperturbable differentials conjectured by Borot--Eynard and recently proved by the authors.

## 10. Cosmic strings and domain walls of the QCD quark condensate with and   without a hidden axion

**Authors:** Gia Dvali, Lucy Komisel, Anja Stuhlfauth

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03542v1)

**Summary:**

The chiral quark condensate of QCD spontaneously breaks the anomalous axial symmetry. This gives rise to axionic type global string-wall systems. If a Peccei-Quinn type axion exists in the theory, the axionic strings are in general accompanied by winding. Depending on the axion model the winding can proceed either in the $\eta'$ or in the pion direction. This determines the structure of fermionic zero modes and the anomaly inflow which has important astrophysical consequences.

## 11. Analytical solution for QCD $\otimes$ QED evolution

**Authors:** Daniel de Florian, Lucas Palma Conte

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03520v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03520v1)

**Summary:**

We present an analytical solution for the evolution of parton distributions incorporating mixed-order QCD QED corrections. Using the Altarelli-Parisi kernels extended to mixed order, we solve the DGLAP equations exactly in Mellin $N$-space. Our analytical approach not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the precision of theoretical predictions relevant to current and future phenomenological applications. We present the Wilson coefficients for the polarized structure function $g_1$. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work.

## 12. Non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged WZW models

**Authors:** José M Figueroa-O'Farrill, Girish S Vishwa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03462v1)

**Summary:**

We construct non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged Wess--Zumino--Witten models. Lie groups with a bi-invariant galilean structure can be seen as the quotient by a null central subgroup. We use a particular free field realisation of the Nappi --Witten current algebra to compute the Virasoro BRST cohomology of the gauge WZW model. This results in a closed string theory reminiscent of the bosonic Gomis--Ooguri string, but whose spectrum differs between the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors.

## 13. Universal Cosmologies

**Authors:** Paul Marconnet, Dimitrios Tsimpis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03449v1)

**Summary:**

Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema. These models generally possess many desirable features, including parametric control of e-folds and late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universalcosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential for an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature) to include other types of supergravity. We show that these models can be repackaged as solutions of 4d models.

## 14. Joyce structures and poles of Painlevé equations

**Authors:** Tom Bridgeland, Fabrizio Del Monte

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03429v1)

**Summary:**

Joyce structures are a class of geometric structures that first arose in relation to Donaldson-Thomas theory. We study two Joyce structures of this type using the isomonodromic systems associated to the Painlev\'e II and III$_3$ equations. The systematic treatment gives a blueprint for the study of more general Joyce structures associated to meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere. We show that the behaviour of the Joyce structure near the zero-section can be studied analytically through poles of Painlev’s equations.

## 15. Effective Field Theory of Superconductivity

**Authors:** Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, Hanwool Song

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03370v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03370v1)

**Summary:**

A field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.

## 16. Notes on su$(1,2)\oplus$u$(1)$ Chern-Simons theory and Torsional   Newton-Cartan gravity

**Authors:** Yang Lei, Dong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03322v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate three-dimensional torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) gravity. We construct its action using the Chern-Simons theory. This TNC exhibits novels features, including the fact that the gauge fields associated with both dilatation and rotation symmetries transform non-trivially under Galilean boosts. This theory also reproduces the Schr\"odinger gravity acquired by gauging the extended $z=2$ Schr\'odinger algebra via $1/c$ expansion.

## 17. Generalization of Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Gravity Effective Action

**Authors:** Aleksandar Mikovic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03305v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) formulation of quantum mechanics to the case of quantum gravity (QG) This is done by replacing the dBB equations of motion with the effective action equations ofmotion. In this way one avoids the violations of the Heisenberg uncertainity relations and the absence of the classical trajectories for stationary bound states. The proposed QG generalization is natural for Bohmiam mechanics because a dBB wavefunction is really a wavefunction of the Universe.

## 18. Deep learning spinfoam vertex amplitudes: the Euclidean Barrett-Crane   model

**Authors:** Hanno Sahlmann, Waleed Sherif

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255v1)

**Summary:**

Spinfoam theories propose a well-defined path-integral formulation for quantum gravity. However, it is computationally hard to calculate spinfoam amplitudes. We explore a data-driven approach to acceleratingspinfoam computations. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression task. Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude is zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The trained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for future work.
