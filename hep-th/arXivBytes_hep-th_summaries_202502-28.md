## 0. Mechanics on flag manifolds

**Authors:** Andrew Kuzovchikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20397v1)

**Summary:**

We study the connection between spin chains and one-dimensional sigma models on flag manifolds. Using this connection, we calculate the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and geodesics for a particular class of metrics on a manifold of complete flags in $\mathbb{C}^3$. We conclude that this connection leads to a more general theory of spin chains on flag manifold magnets. We also show that this theory can be generalized to a manifold with more complete flags.

## 1. Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization   group study

**Authors:** Sk Asrap Murshed, Sanjib Kumar Das, Bitan Roy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394v1)

**Summary:**

In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials are doped.

## 2. Positivity of the Veneziano Amplitude in Ten Dimensions

**Authors:** Gareth Mansfield

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20372v1)

**Summary:**

The Veneziano amplitude describing the tree-level scattering of four open superstrings is expected to be consistent with unitarity in ten spacetime dimensions. While this follows indirectly from the no-ghost theorem, a direct proof at the level of the amplitude has only been found for $D\leq 6$. In this note, we close this gap by providing a complete proof for the partial-wave positivity of this amplitude in $D \leq 10$. We also demonstrate that this proof can be modified to show positivity for a wider family of amplitudes relevant to the $S$-matrix bootstrap.

## 3. Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with   Unruh-DeWitt detectors

**Authors:** Albert Georg Passegger, Rainer Verch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects.

## 4. Dual Non-Lorentzian Backgrounds for Matrix Theories

**Authors:** Chris D. A. Blair, Johannes Lahnsteiner, Niels A. Obers, Ziqi Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20310v1)

**Summary:**

We study properties of non-Lorentzian geometries arising from BPS decoupling limits of string theory that are central to matrix theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We demonstrate that T- and S-duality transformations exhibit novel asymmetric properties. We show how the holographic correspondence involving non-commutative Yang-Mills fits into our framework, from which we further obtain novel holographic examples with non-lorentZian bulk geometry.

## 5. Model spaces as constrained Hamiltonian systems: I. Application to   $\mathrm{SU}(2)$

**Authors:** Glenn Barnich, Thomas Smoes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20267v1)

**Summary:**

We study model spaces and their quantization from the viewpoint of constrained Hamiltonian systems. The analysis sheds some light on the definition and properties of spin-weighted/monopole spherical harmonics. Besides recovering well-known results on the quantum theory of angular momentum from a unified perspective, the analysis also recovers some information about the definition of spherical harmonICS. We work out all details in the simplest case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We conclude with a discussion of the group-theoretical questions relevant to the gravitational setting.

## 6. Homotopy Manin Theories: Generalising Third-Way, Yang-Mills and   Integrable Sigma Models

**Authors:** Alex S. Arvanitakis, Leron Borsten, Dimitri Kanakaris, Hyungrok Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20251v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20251v1)

**Summary:**

Manin theories are non-topological deformations of Chern-Simons theories. They admit localisation despite not being supersymmetric in the usual sense. In this paper, we extend this construction to higher dimensions. This produces a large class of examples of third-way-type theories. The construction naturally yields Yang-Baxter integrable deformations. It also yields gravitational models various dimensions. The results are published in the Journal of Theoretical and Applied Physics (JTPAP)

## 7. Stability of multi-state configurations of fuzzy dark matter

**Authors:** Francisco S. Guzman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20222v1)

**Summary:**

We study the stability properties of multi-state configurations of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system without self-interaction. We show these configurations studied are stable using numerical simulations. The astrophysical implication of this result is that this type of configurations is at least stable and can be considered physically sound in multi- state ultralight bosonic dark matter. The study covers a range of states with monopolar to dipolar mass ratio between 47 and 0.17. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 8. Unveiling Orbital Chaos: The Wild Heart of Fuzzy Dark Matter Structures

**Authors:** Ivan Alvarez-Rios, Francisco S. Guzman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20205v1)

**Summary:**

Study of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure. Core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. No trajectory remains circular, trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps.

## 9. Love numbers beyond GR from the modified Teukolsky equation

**Authors:** Pablo A. Cano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20185v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20185v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain the full set of tidal Love numbers of non-rotating black holes in an effective field theory extension of general relativity. The modified Teukolsky equation proves to be very useful as it allows us to obtain all the different Love numbers in a unified framework. We observe that there are three types of Love numbers: electric, magnetic, and a ``mixing'' type, associated to parity-breaking theories, that we identify here for the first time. The method introduced here paves the way towards the computation of Love number of rotating black holes beyond general relativity, we say.

## 10. Numerical simulations of density perturbation and gravitational wave   production from cosmological first-order phase transition

**Authors:** Jintao Zou, Zhiqing Zhu, Zizhuo Zhao, Ligong Bian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20166v1)

**Summary:**

We conducted three-dimensional lattice simulations to study the density perturbation and generation of gravitational waves (GWs) through first-order phase transition (FOPTs) Our findings reveal that for the case of $\beta/H = 6$, density perturations successfully collapse into PBHs. Our numerical simulations confirm that slow PTs can produce PBH and provide predictions for the GW power spectrum, offering crucial theoretical support for GW detection. We find that for $k^3$ at small wavenumbers, and the simulation results show a slope of $k^{-2}$ at large wavenumber.

## 11. Fundamental Physics and Cosmology with TianQin

**Authors:** Jun Luo, Haipeng An, Ligong Bian, Rong-Gen Cai, Zhoujian Cao, Wenbiao Han, Jianhua He, Martin A. Hendry, Bin Hu, Yi-Ming Hu, Fa Peng Huang, Shun-Jia Huang, Sang Pyo Kim, En-Kun Li, Yu-Xiao Liu, Vadim Milyukov, Shi Pi, Konstantin Postnov, Misao Sasaki, Cheng-Gang Shao, Lijing Shao, Changfu Shi, Shuo Sun, Anzhong Wang, Pan-Pan Wang, Sai Wang, Shao-Jiang Wang, Zhong-Zhi Xianyu, Huan Yang, Tao Yang, Jian-dong Zhang, Xin Zhang, Wen Zhao, Liang-Gui Zhu, Jianwei Mei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20138v1)

**Summary:**

The space-based gravitational wave detector TianQin will tune in to gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency range. It will open a new gravitational wave spectrum window to explore many of the previously hidden sectors of the universe. The plethora of information collected will bring us to new fronts on which to search for the breaking points of general relativity, the possible violation of established physical laws, the signature of possible new gravitational physics and new fundamental fields. The discoveries will improve our knowledge on the expansion history of the universes.

## 12. Radially symmetric scalar field solutions in the presence of cuscuton   term

**Authors:** D. Bazeia, M. A. Marques, R. Menezes, M. Paganelly

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20064v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate radially symmetric solutions in arbitrary dimensions in scalar field models in the presence of the cuscuton term. We introduce a first-order formalism compatible with the equation of motion which supports field configurations engendering minimum energy. The cus cuton term does not induce instabilities in the solutions. To illustrate the general results, we study two distinct classes of models and present analytical solutions and the corresponding energy densities.

## 13. Rotating Casimir Wormholes

**Authors:** Remo Garattini, Athanasios G. Tzikas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19995v1)

**Summary:**

A Casimir Wormhole is a Traversable Wormhole powered by a Casimir energy source within a static reference frame. A natural extension of this system is the inclusion of rotation. We will explore two basic configurations: one with radially varying Casimir plates and another with parametrically fixed plates. In both cases, we will show that rotations do not alter the structure of aCasimir wormhole and the behavior observed in a static frame is reaffirmed. The consistency of the Einstein Field Equations is ensured with the help of an additional source without an accompanying energy density.

## 14. Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius

**Authors:** Jungjai Lee, Yongjun Yun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880v1)

**Summary:**

We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model with a scalar torsion $phi$ under the assumption of no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We show that the accelerating expansion can occur by setting the IR cut-off to the Hubble radius as $L=H^{-1}$ with the Hubble parameter $H$. Motivated by two physical choices based on Friedmann equations and the holographic principle, tellingly, spin-induced torsions occur at non-zero matter density.

## 15. Color-magnetic correlations in SU(N) lattice QCD

**Authors:** Hideo Suganuma, Atsuya Tokutake, Kei Tohme

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19874v1)

**Summary:**

In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations are described by these two quantities. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point correlation. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$. The quadratics term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator.

## 16. Structure of center vortex matter in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory

**Authors:** J. A. Mickley, D. B. Leinweber, L. E. Oxman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19656v1)

**Summary:**

The structure of center vortices is studied in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory for the first time to illuminate the interplay between elementary (center charge $+2$) and doubly charged (charge $pm 1$) Vortices. An algorithm is described to classify every doublycharged chain as one of these three types. A collection of vortex statistics is considered to quantify the vortex structure. Three different lattice spacings are employed to investigate the approach to the continuum limit.
