## 0. How to Falsify String Theory at a Collider

**Authors:** Matthew Baumgart, Panagiotis Christeas, Jonathan J. Heckman, Rebecca J. Hicks

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13192v1)

**Summary:**

The string landscape accommodates a broad range of possible effective field theories. This poses a challenge for extracting verifiable predictions as well as falsifiable signatures of string theory. We consider a phenomenologically well-motivated scenario of a single Majorana particle in a real, $n$-dimensional representation of $SU(2)_L$ with $n \geq 5$ $\textit{and nothing else}$. This scenario is not realized in any known string construction. We recast existing LHC searches for new electroweak states to extract updated bounds.

## 1. Symmetries of the Celestial Supersphere

**Authors:** Adam Tropper

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13113v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13113v1)

**Summary:**

The boundary theory realizes supersymmetry in the spirit of the Green-Schwarz superstring. There is manifest 4d super-Poincar\'e symmetry, but no 2d superconformal symmetry. Nevertheless, we can extend the celestial sphere itself to a supermanifold -- the celestial supersphere. This provides a unified framework for describing key features of celestial holography, including conformally soft theorems, OPEs, and chiral soft algebras.

## 2. DiFfRG: A Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group   flows

**Authors:** Franz R. Sattler, Jan M. Pawlowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13043v1)

**Summary:**

DiFfRG is a C++ framework for solving functional Renormalisation Group flows. It uses Finite Element Methods (FEM) for efficient, easy to set up and reliable computations of field dependences. The framework provides a Mathematica package for automatic code generation of flow equations, finite and zero temperature integration routines with support for GPU hardware and extensive parallelisation capabilities. Detailed examples and tutorials are provided and discussed herein which showcase and introduce the framework to the user. We illustrate the capabilities of DiFf RG with four examples, with the complete codes fully included.

## 3. Baryogenesis from Primordial CP Violation

**Authors:** Venus Keus, Edward W. Kolb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12957v1)

**Summary:**

Baryogenesis is a new type of quantum theory. Baryons are created by an asymmetry of scalars in a three-Higgs doublet model. This asymmetry is translated into baryons through electroweak instantons. The mechanism is described in the book Baryogenesis: A New Theory of Baryonogenesis. The book is published by Oxford University Press and is available on Amazon.com for £8.99.

## 4. Quantum theory of the Lemaitre model for gravitational collapse

**Authors:** Claus Kiefer, Hamid Mohaddes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12947v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the quantum fate of the classical singularities that occur by gravitational collapse of a dust cloud. We find that the singularities can generically be avoided. This is a consequence of unitary evolution in the quantum theory, whereby the quantum dust cloud collapses, bounces at a minimal radius and re-expands. We address the quantization of a model first proposed by Georges Lemaitre in 1933, and find that it can be used to predict the quantum state of a cloud.

## 5. Exact g-function without strings

**Authors:** Yi-Jun He, Yunfeng Jiang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12869v1)

**Summary:**

The approach is based on an integrable lattice regularization of the quantum field theory. The exact $g$-function is encoded in the overlap of theIntegrable boundary state and the ground state on the lattice, which can be computed exactly by Bethe ansatz. This approach bypasses the difficulties of dealing with magnetic excitations for non-diagonal scattering theories in the framework of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. We obtain numerical and analytical results of the exact $ g-function for the prototypical sine-Gordon theory.

## 6. CoLoRFul for hadron collisions: Integrating the counterterms

**Authors:** S. Van Thurenhout, V. Del Duca, C. Duhr, L. Fekésházy, F. Guadagni, P. Mukherjee, G. Somogyi, F. Tramontano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12750v1)

**Summary:**

In order to numerically compute scattering cross sections in QCD, one needs to deal with various kinematic divergences that appear at intermediate stages of the calculation. One way of doing this is by setting up an IR subtraction scheme. In this talk we give an update on the status of extending the CoLoRFul subtracted scheme, which has been successfully used in the past for processes with only final-state hadrons. In particular we discuss the analytic computation of the integrated counterterms.

## 7. Inflation and primordial fluctuations in $f(Q,T)$ gravity

**Authors:** Parviz Goodarzi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12618v1)

**Summary:**

We study slow roll inflation and the generation of primordial density fluctuations within the context of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. By imposing constraints on the parameters of the model, we achieve results that align well with the Planck 2018 data. Interestingly, a model including a $T^2$ dependence showed good agreement with the observational data. We calculate the power spectrum and spectral index for scalar and tensor modes within the $f('Q'', 'T') model.

## 8. Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle   interactions

**Authors:** Hobbes Sprague, Shanmuka Shivashankara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585v1)

**Summary:**

Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. The article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics for any particle interaction. For the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton, the language of relativistic quantum mechanics is used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation. For hard scattering, unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function.

## 9. Breakdown of hydrodynamics in a Galilean quantum Hall crystal

**Authors:** Xiaoyang Huang, Andrew Lucas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12535v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12535v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic effective field theory for Galilean-invariant quantum Hall systems with spontaneously broken translational symmetry. We observe this scaling in numerical simulations of many-body classical Hamiltonian dynamics, in a model of an electronic crystal in the lowest Landau level. Observing this magnetophonon decay rate in a quantum Hall crystal represents a promising setting to detect an analogue of a "fractonic dynamical universality class" in a solid-state system.

## 10. Gravitational Atoms and Black Hole Binaries

**Authors:** Giovanni Maria Tomaselli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12526v1)

**Summary:**

Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new ultralight bosons. This thesis investigates a way to discover such particles through observations of gravitational waves from binary black holes. This is possible through black hole superradiance, which spontaneously creates a "boson cloud" around a rapidly spinning black hole. The predictions can be tested with current and future interferometers, such as LISA, LIGO, DECIGO and TianQin. The most distinctive observational signatures of the cloud are the orbital energy lost through ionization.

## 11. Quantum aspects of non-invertible flavor symmetries in   intersecting/magnetized D-brane models

**Authors:** Shuta Funakoshi, Tatsuo Kobayashi, Hajime Otsuka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12524v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss selection rules of chiral matters in type IIA intersecting and IIB magnetized D-brane models on toroidal orbifolds. The selection rules involve non-trivial fusion rules. We find that the representation of the chiral matter is described by a $D_4$ flavor symmetry for an even number of magnetic fluxes or winding numbers at tree level. We also study non-perturbative effects such as D- brane instantons. We conclude that the selection rules on toroid orbifold models are not very complex.

## 12. Towards Quantizing Null p-branes: Light-Cone Gauge Analysis and Physical   Hilbert Space

**Authors:** S. Dutta, I. M. Rasulian, M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari, H. Yavartanoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12436v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12436v1)

**Summary:**

We study null $p$-branes with a Carrollian $p+1$-dimensional worldvolume embedded in a generic $D$- dimensional flat Minkowski target space. We quantize the theory in the light-cone gauge via canonical quantization and construct the physical Hilbert space by imposing the remaining constraints using sandwich conditions. In addition, we discuss special and interesting case of membranes in four dimensions and examine the physical implications of the quantized null $ p-brane.
