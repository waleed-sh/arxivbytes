## 0. Boundary Witten effect in multi-axion insulators

**Authors:** Giandomenico Palumbo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16919v1)

**Summary:**

We explore novel topological responses and axion-like phenomena in three-dimensional insulating systems with spacetime-dependent mass terms encoding domain walls. Via a dimensional-reduction approach, we derive a newAxion-electromagnetic coupling term involving three axion fields. This term yields a topological current in the bulk and real-space topological defects such as magnetic-like monopoles and hopfions. Our findings reveal rich topological structures emerging from multi-axion theories, suggesting new avenues in the study of topological phases and defects.

## 1. Collinear Corrections to the Cachazo-Strominger Soft Theorem

**Authors:** Eivind Jørstad, Sruthi A. Narayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16903v1)

**Summary:**

Soft theorems describe the behavior of scattering amplitudes when one or several external particles are taken to be energetically soft. The form of the sub-subleading soft graviton theorem was elucidated by Cachazo and Strominger using a BCFW expansion of graviton amplitudes. In this work we show that consistency with results based on asymptotic charges requires a careful treatment of collinear singularities in the amplitude, giving rise to corrections to the usual Cchazo-Strominger soft theorem.

## 2. $SO(4)$ gauged $O(5)$ Skyrmion on $\mathbb{R}^4$

**Authors:** Francisco Navarro-Lerida, D. H. Tchrakian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16859v1)

**Summary:**

We have studied an $SO(4)$ gauged $O(5)$ Skyrmion on $4+1$ dimension. It can be seen as a static soliton in $4-1$ dimensions. This is a sequel of the known $so(D)$ gauge-decoupling soliton. The curvatures of both of these solutions decay as $r^{-3}$, are bounded below by the topological charge, and are localised to an absolute scale. They may have the potential of being interpreted as instantons.

## 3. Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance

**Authors:** Malte Henkel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857v1)

**Summary:**

A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing. This arises in many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $ t_c$. Generalised time- translation-invaryance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries.

## 4. Boundary anomalous dimensions from BCFT: O($N$)-symmetric $φ^{2n}$   theories with a boundary and higher-derivative generalizations

**Authors:** Yongwei Guo, Wenliang Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16844v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the deformations of the O($N$)-symmetric (generalized) free theories with a flat boundary, where $n\geqslant 2$ is an integer. The leading anomalous dimensions of some boundary operators are derived from the bulk multiplet recombination and analyticity constraints. Using the analytic bootstrap, we further verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with boundary crossing symmetry. We find that the $\epsilon^{1/2}$ expansion in the special transition extends to other multicritical cases with larger odd integer $n$.

## 5. Supersymmetric Warped Solutions from Type IIB Orientifold Reduction

**Authors:** S. Maurelli, R. Noris, M. Oyarzo, H. Samtleben, M. Trigiante

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16822v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a family of supersymmetric solutions in Type IIB supergravity of the form. These backgrounds are constructed by uplifting corresponding solutions in the $D=6$ ungauged supergravity. We discuss the relation of these backgrounds to known solutions. We also construct solutions of a 2-parameter deformation of a 3-sphere and a warped anti-de Sitter spacetime in the form of a warped product. We conclude by looking at the relation between these backgrounds and known supergravity solutions.

## 6. Toroidal black holes in four dimensions

**Authors:** Carlos Barceló, Gerardo García-Moreno, Alejandro Jiménez Cano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16790v1)

**Summary:**

Black holes in four dimensional spacetimes can have event horizons with arbitrary topologies. It is only when energy conditions are imposed that the horizon's shape is constrained to be spherical. Exploring exotic horizon topologies remains theoretically intriguing since it allows to unveil structural aspects of General Relativity and gain intuition on energy condition violations. To the best of our knowledge, we present here is the first explicit example of a toroidal black hole solution in four spacetime dimensions that is free of singularities in the external region.

## 7. Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons

**Authors:** Christian Käding

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16784v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16784v1)

**Summary:**

It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino.

## 8. On integrability of tri-vector deformed Type II string

**Authors:** Edvard Musaev, Gleb Zverev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16773v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse dynamics of the closed Type IIA and IIB string on various tri- vector deformed background searching for signatures of integrability. We find that the corresponding Lyapunov exponents decay showing that trajectories do not diverge. Using numerical methods we construct Poincar\'e sections for particular embeddings of the string and show that these are not destroyed under tri-vector deformation. We conclude that the dynamics of a string on a tri-dimensional background can be analysed using numerical methods.

## 9. A Note on the Stability of the Dark Energy Model from Time Crystals

**Authors:** Laura Mersini-Houghton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16764v1)

**Summary:**

In this note, we investigate the stability of the dark energy model from time crystals proposed in [1]. We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the scalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an expanding FRW background. The Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion, grows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these factors also alleviate the stability concern of [1] and [2] We conclude that the model is stable.

## 10. Invertible Orbifolds over Finite Fields

**Authors:** Marco Aldi, Andrija Perunicic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16716v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16716v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of Berglund-Huebsch mirror symmetry, we compute the eigenvalues of the Frobenius endomorphism acting on a p-adic version of Borisov's complex. As a result, we conjecture an explicit formula for the number of points of crepant resolutions of invertible Calabi-Yau orbifolds defined over a finite field. We conclude that this formula can be written in terms of the eigenvalues of Borisov’s complex.

## 11. Hawking-Rényi black hole thermodynamics, Kiselev solution, and cosmic   censorship

**Authors:** Viktor G. Czinner, Hideo Iguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16705v1)

**Summary:**

For every static, spherically symmetric, vacuum black hole space-time, a corresponding black hole solution can be derived. In order to have this Hawking-R\'enyi type thermodynamic property, the black holes must be surrounded by an anisotropic fluid in the form of a Kiselev metric. In the simplest Schwarzschild scenario, the system is found to be thermodynamically unstable, and the 3rd law of thermodynamics seems to play the role of a cosmic censor via placing an upper bound on the black hole's mass.

## 12. More on genuine multi-entropy and holography

**Authors:** Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin, Mitsuhiro Nishida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the construction of genuine multi-entropy for multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2504.01625. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $a. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite Entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartisan entanglements in bulk reconstruction.

## 13. On the zoology of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ dualities gauge theories with   antisymmetric matter

**Authors:** Antonio Amariti, Pietro Glorioso, Chiara Mascherpa, Andrea Zanetti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16544v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we investigate and propose new dualities involving 2d gauge theories with supersymmetry. We provide a 4d origin for a gauge/LG duality that does not descend from any known s-confining duality. In the last part of the paper we focus on dualities for 2d models with antisymmetric Fermi multiplets, obtained from dimensional reduction of 4d parent dualities. In each case we provide evidences of a dual LG description, by matching the 't Hooft anomalies'

## 14. Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local   Thermodynamics

**Authors:** Shuichi Yokoyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517v1)

**Summary:**

A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. The general relativists Poisson equation and the heat conduction one are developed exactly.

## 15. Octonions, complex structures and Standard Model fermions

**Authors:** Kirill Krasnov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16465v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16465v1)

**Summary:**

This article is a write-up of the talk given in one of the mini-symposia of the 2024 European Congress of Mathematicians. I explain some basics of the representation theory underlying Spin(10) and SU(5) Grand Unified Theories. I will also explain the characterisation of the Standard Model gauge group G_SM as a subgroup of Spin( 10) that was developed in [1] The most efficient description of spinors, and in particular pure spinors ofspin(10), is via the octonionic model of the latter. This is how octonions enter the story.

## 16. Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-$k$

**Authors:** Muxin Han

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16367v1)

**Summary:**

This paper develops a framework for the Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory. The approach follows the procedure of combinatorial quantization to construct the operator algebras of quantum holonomies on 2-surfaces. The $*$-representation of the operator algebra is carried by the infinite dimensional Hilbert space. We demonstrate that the physical Hilbert space carries a Fenchel-Nielsen representation, where a set of Wilson loop operators associated with a pants decomposition of $m$ are diagonalized.

## 17. Thawing quintessence and transient cosmic acceleration in light of DESI

**Authors:** Rayff de Souza, Gabriel Rodrigues, Jailson Alcaniz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16337v1)

**Summary:**

Recent analysis of the DESI Collaboration challenges the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model. The results are obtained in the context of generic parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state. The thawing behavior of this EoS outperforms the CPL parameterization. Such a dynamic behavior aligns with theoretical arguments from string theory and offers a way out of the trans-Planckian problem that challenges the ever-accelerated $\Lamb da$CDM paradigm.
