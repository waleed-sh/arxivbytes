## 0. Sphaleron decay on circles

**Authors:** S. Navarro-Obregón, J. Queiruga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11635v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss various sphaleron-like solutions on $\mathbb{S}^1$. These solutions are static, but unstable. We explore possible stabilization mechanisms based on the excitation of internal modes. We observe that, on time scales comparable to the size of the circle, the collapse of large sp Halerons mimics the kink-antikink scattering on the real line. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to the problem of how to make the circle larger and larger.

## 1. Electroweak Symmetry Breaking

**Authors:** J. W. Moffat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11548v1)

**Summary:**

This paper examines the Higgs particle self-coupling and its implications for electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model. It also considers an alternative ultraviolet complete electroweak theory based on finite quantum field theory, which does not require spontaneous symmetry breaking or a non-zero vacuum expectation value. The predictions of this model for particle masses and the stability of the electroweak vacuum are compared to the standard Higgs mechanism. Finally, we review the SM derivation of the W-boson mass, its dependence on radiative corrections and its experimentally determined value.

## 2. Inconsistency of point particle's dynamics on higher-spin backgrounds

**Authors:** Vyacheslav Ivanovskiy, Dmitry Ponomarev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11546v1)

**Summary:**

We use the light-cone gauge formalism to study interactions of point particles with chiral higher-spin fields. We argue that our result implies that Riemannian geometry cannot be extended to spaces with non-trivial higher- Spin fields. In the present paper we focus on a case of a massless particle, while a more technical massive case will be analysed in a companion paper. We conclude that chiral high-spin theories form inevitable closed subsectors of any consistent higher- spin theories in flat space.

## 3. Holographic Description of Bulk Wave Packets in AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$

**Authors:** Norihiro Tanahashi, Seiji Terashima, Shiki Yoshikawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11485v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we extend the study of wave packets from the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. We find that, while the energy still localizes on the light cone, its spatial distribution exhibits momentum dependence. This result is significant as it reflects leading $1/N$ corrections to the generalized free field theory associated with the free bulk theory at $N=\infty$. Our findings are consistent with previous studies on entanglement wedge reconstruction.

## 4. Gravitational form factors in the perturbative limit

**Authors:** Qin-Tao Song, O. V. Teryaev, Shinsuke Yoshida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11316v1)

**Summary:**

The generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) have been paid attention in recent years because of their relation with the energy momentum tensor (EMT) form factors (FFs) In this paper we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit where the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are expressed. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF which breaks the conservation law of EMT for each quark flavor in its hadronic matrix element. In future, the GDAs and EMTFFs studied in this paper can be investigated at Belle II.

## 5. The Fierz-Pauli theory on curved spacetime at one-loop and its   counterterms

**Authors:** Leonardo Farolfi, Filippo Fecit

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11304v1)

**Summary:**

We focus on the Fierz-Pauli theory in a curved spacetime. We apply suitable gauge-fixing procedures to simplify the complicated non-minimal kinetic operators of the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors of the theory. Using standard techniques, we then compute the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients, with particular emphasis on the fourth coefficient, $a_3(D)$, in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. This result constitutes our main contribution, as it has not been previously reported in full generality in the literature.

## 6. Growth of Cosmic Strings beyond Kination

**Authors:** Luca Brunelli, Michele Cicoli, Francisco G. Pedro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11293v1)

**Summary:**

A novel mechanism for the production of a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. In this paper, we generalise the analysis of this growth mechanism by using dynamical system techniques. We find a cosmological growth for fundamental strings even without kination, as in scaling fixed points, and for EFT strings arising from D3- and NS5-branes wrapped around fibration cycles. We then apply this analysis to fundamental strings and EFTstrings obtained from wrapping $p$-brane on $(p-1)$-cycles.

## 7. Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in   Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models

**Authors:** Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274v1)

**Summary:**

The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach. We advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction. The findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos.

## 8. c-theorem and improvement in non-compact conformal field theories

**Authors:** Nanami Nakamura, Yu Nakayama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11188v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11188v1)

**Summary:**

Energy-momentum tensor in general conformal field theories have improvement ambiguity and it can affect the argument in deriving $c$-theorem. When the theory suffers an IR divergence due to the non-compactness, the c-function can be unbounded and may even show non-monotonicity. We find that one of the three-point function sum rule proposed by Hartman and Mathys motivated by the averaged null energy condition is agnostic about the improvement and gives the (effective) Virasoro central charge.

## 9. Connecting Relativistic MOND Theories with Mimetic Gravity

**Authors:** Guillem Domènech, Alexander Ganz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11174v1)

**Summary:**

We find a connection between relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theories and (scalar) mimetic gravity. We first demonstrate that any MOND model featuring a unit-timelike vector field, such as TeVeS, can be embedded within a conformal/disformal-invariant framework. This perspective offers deeper insight into how non-invertible disformal transformations serve as fundamental principles in constructing viable alternatives to dark matter. Lastly, by constructing the fundamental building blocks of a scalar- vector-tensor theory, we establish a new framework for developing MOND theories.

## 10. Gravitational lensing by non-self-intersecting vortons

**Authors:** Leonardus B. Putra, H. S. Ramadhan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11025v1)

**Summary:**

We present exact solutions to the Nambu-Goto equations for thin vortons stabilized by chiral currents. The solutions describe a class of non-self-intersecting, stationary loops with arbitrary shapes. We found that, in general, the vorton's constraints allow for constructing families of solutions with arbitrary harmonic modes. We further investigate the gravitational lensing effects associated with these solutions under the weak-field and thin-lens approximations. The corresponding Einstein ring co-exist alongside an almost undistorted source image.

## 11. Bumblebee gravity: spherically-symmetric solutions away from the   potential minimum

**Authors:** Quentin G. Bailey, Hailey S. Murray, Dario T. Walter-Cardona

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10998v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study a vector model of spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking coupled to gravity. The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source. Finally, we discuss observational constraints on these spacetimes using the resulting orbital behavior.

## 12. Supersymmetric Higher-Spin Gauge Theories in any $d$ and their Coupling   Constants within BRST Formalism

**Authors:** M. A. Vasiliev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10967v1)

**Summary:**

Higher-spin gauge theory is anticipated to possess an infinite number of independent coupling constants. A conjecture that these coupling constants result from the locality restrictions on the elements of the factorisation ideal is put forward. The $osp(1,2)$ invariance and factorisation conditions are formulated within the BRST formalism, that greatly simplifies the form of nonlinear HS equations. To match the list of vertices found by Metsaev, higher-spin gauge  Theory is anticipated to possess an infinite number of independent couplings.
