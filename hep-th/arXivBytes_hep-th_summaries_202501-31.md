## 0. Non-Hermitian catalysis of density-wave orders on Euclidean and   hyperbolic lattices

**Authors:** Christopher A. Leong, Bitan Roy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18591v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18591v1)

**Summary:**

Noninteracting electronic fluids are characterized by a vanishing, a finite, and a diverging density of states near half-filling. We show that on two-dimensional bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices such a non-Hermiticity catalyzes the formation of both charge- density-wave and spin-density-wave orders at weaker (in comparison to the counterparts in conventional or Hermitian systems) NN Coulomb and Hubbard repulsions. These two ordered states correspond to staggered patterns of average electronic density and spin between the NN sites.

## 1. Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings

**Authors:** Mehran Z. Abyaneh, Mehrdad Farhoudi, Mahdi Mashkoori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18573v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. We show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.

## 2. Fractonic self-duality and covariant magnetic fractons

**Authors:** Erica Bertolini, Giandomenico Palumbo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18510v1)

**Summary:**

Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. We find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.

## 3. The EFT Bootstrap at Finite $M_{PL}$

**Authors:** Carl Beadle, Giulia Isabella, Davide Perrone, Sara Ricossa, Francesco Riva, Francesco Serra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18465v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18465v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the impact of loop effects on positivity in effective field theories emerging in the infrared from unitary and causal microscopic dynamics. Focusing on massless particles coupled to gravity, we address the treatment of forward-limit divergences from loop discontinuities. While loop effects remain small, ensuring consistency in our approach leads to a significant impact on bounds, even at tree level. We establish necessary conditions for maintaining computational control in perturbation theory. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 4. Chiral non-Abelian vortex molecules in dense QCD

**Authors:** Sven Bjarke Gudnason, Muneto Nitta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18464v1)

**Summary:**

The color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD admits non-Abelian vortices, that are superfluid vortice with confined color-magnetic fluxes. Vortex solutions were thus far constructed in an axially symmetric Ansatz with common vortex winding in the left- and right-handed diquark condensates. In this paper, we explore vortex solutions without any Ansatz. We find that the axial symmetry is broken in certain parameter regions.

## 5. Asymptotics in the bi-Yang-Baxter Sigma Model

**Authors:** Meer Ashwinkumar, Domenico Orlando, Susanne Reffert, Giacomo Sberveglieri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18458v1)

**Summary:**

Volin's method is a powerful tool to analytically access models that are either strongly coupled or otherwise difficult to solve explicitly. In this note, we apply this method to the bi-Yang-Baxter deformed $SU(2)$ principal chiral model. Our main result is an explicit expression for the free energy density as an asymptotic expansion. We moreover determine the leading non-perturbative effects both via analytic methods and a resurgence analysis. We conclude that Volin's approach is a good way to work in a sector of large charge.

## 6. Optimizers for Stabilizing Likelihood-free Inference

**Authors:** G. Bruno De Luca, Benjamin Nachman, Eva Silverstein, Henry Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18419v1)

**Summary:**

A growing number of applications in particle physics and beyond use neural networks as unbinned likelihood ratio estimators applied to real or simulated data. Precision requirements on the inference tasks demand a high-level of stability from these networks. We show how physics concepts can be used to stabilize network training through a physics-inspired optimizer. We expect that ECD will be a useful tool for wide array of data-limited problems, where it is computationally expensive to exhaustively optimize hyperparameters and mitigate fluctuations with ensembling.

## 7. Global Structure in the Presence of a Topological Defect

**Authors:** Arun Debray, Weicheng Ye, Matthew Yu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18399v1)

**Summary:**

Topological defects wrap a submanifold $F\subset M$ in a quantum field theory. The Pontryagin-Thom construction oversees the interplay between the global structure of $F$ and $M$. We will employ this construction to two distinct mathematical frameworks with physical applications. The first framework is the concept of a characteristic structure, consisting of the data of pairs of manifolds. The second framework uses obstruction theory and the fact that spontaneously broken finite symmetries leave behind domain walls.

## 8. Holographic Correlators of Boundary/Crosscap CFTs in Two Dimensions

**Authors:** Yun-Ze Li, Yunfei Xie, Song He

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18386v1)

**Summary:**

This work explores holographic correlators within the frameworks of two-dimensional Boundary Conformal Field Theory. We compute stress tensor correlators in BCFT, considering both tensionless and tensionful end-of-the-world (EOW) brane scenarios. Extending these results, we investigate the holographic duals of XCFTs, presenting explicit scalar and stress Tensor correlator computations on projective geometries such as $\mathbb{RP}^2$.

## 9. Gaussian-process reconstructions and model building of quintom dark   energy from latest cosmological observations

**Authors:** Yuhang Yang, Qingqing Wang, Chunyu Li, Peibo Yuan, Xin Ren, Emmanuel N. Saridakis, Yi-Fu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18336v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18336v1)

**Summary:**

In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct thecosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations. We divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy. We show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.

## 10. Tensor-network Toolbox for probing dynamics of non-Abelian Gauge   Theories

**Authors:** Emil Mathew, Navya Gupta, Saurabh Kadam, Jesse Stryker, Zohreh Davoudi, Indrakshi Raychowdhury

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18301v1)

**Summary:**

Tensor-network methods are valuable Hamiltonian-simulation methods which enable probing dynamics of strongly-interacting quantum-many-body systems. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state (MPS) ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron (LSH) framework. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.

## 11. Cosmological quantum mechanics on FLRW spacetimes

**Authors:** Edwin Beggs, Shahn Majid

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18295v1)

**Summary:**

We apply our recent formulation of general relativistic quantum mechanics to the case of an FLRW cosmological background. The formalism comes from noncommutative geometry and provides an operator version of the equations of a geodesic. We also show how this is relevant to quantum mechanics on space with respect to time $t$, identifying potentially new physics when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.

## 12. Factorisation schemes for proton PDFs

**Authors:** Stéphane Delorme, Aleksander Kusina, Andrzej Siódmok, James Whitehead

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18289v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18289v1)

**Summary:**

Beyond leading-order, perturbative QCD requires a choice of factorisation scheme to define the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and hard-process cross-section. The modified minimal-subtraction scheme has long been adopted as the default choice due to its simplicity. Alternative schemes have been proposed with specific purposes, including PDF positivity and NLO parton-shower matching. We perform a detailed comparison of their features, both analytically and numerically, and estimate the resulting factorisation-scheme uncertainty for LHC phenomenology.

## 13. Baryon construction with $η^\prime$ meson field

**Authors:** Fan Lin, Yong-Liang Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18159v1)

**Summary:**

In the low-energy regime, baryons with $N_f \geq 2$ have long been constructed as skyrmions or through bag models. Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryon can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\eta'$ domain wall. This could provide a possible link to quark-hadron continuity at high density. In this paper, we review the progress in this development with special interests in the $N-prime$ domain walls dynamics.

## 14. There is Room at the Top: Fundamental Quantum Limits for Detecting   Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Xinyao Guo, Haixing Miao, Zhi-Wei Wang, Huan Yang, Ye-Ling Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146v1)

**Summary:**

The sky of astrophysical gravitational waves is expected to be quiet above $\sim 10{\rm kHz}$, which is the upper limit of characteristic frequencies of dynamical processes involving astrophysical black holes and neutron stars. Ultra-high frequency GWs also provide a window to test topological defects such as domain walls and cosmic strings generated close to the GUT scale. We develop a universal framework for the quantum limit under different measurement schemes and input quantum states, and apply them to several plausible detector configurations. The fundamental limits are expressed as the strength of gravitational wave background at different frequencies.

## 15. New vacuum boundary effects of massive field theories

**Authors:** Manuel Asorey, Fernando Ezquerro, Miguel Pardina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18072v1)

**Summary:**

The Casimir energy in 2+1 dimensions for gauge theories exponentially decays with the distance between the boundaries. The dependence of this exponential decay on the different boundary conditions could help to better understand the infrared behavior of these theories and in particular their mass spectrum. These results will be useful for a comparison with the Casimirenergy in the non-perturbative regime of non-Abelian gauge theories. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysics of Massive Scalar Fields, published by Springer.

## 16. Physics on and off the light cone

**Authors:** Philip D. Mannheim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18068v1)

**Summary:**

We study light-front physics and conformal symmetry, and their interplay both on and off the light cone. We show that there is a light- front structure to both AdS/CFT and the eikonal approximation. While mass generation involves scale breaking mass scales, we show that such mass scales can arise via dynamical symmetry breaking in the presence of scale invariant interactions at a renormalization group fixed point. We discuss the connection of the light-Front approach to the infinite momentum frame approach, and show that vacuum graphs are outside this framework.
