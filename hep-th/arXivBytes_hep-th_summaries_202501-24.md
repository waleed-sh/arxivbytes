## 0. Localization and wall-crossing of giant graviton expansions in AdS$_5$

**Authors:** Giorgos Eleftheriou, Sameer Murthy, Martí Rosselló

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13910v1)

**Summary:**

Super Yang-Mills theory with unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic groups all admit $q$-expansions. We show that the analytic continuation for these giant graviton expansions maps precisely to a wall-crossing phenomenon for the index. Additional terms in the expansion related to the Pfaffian operator arise from topologically stable branes in the bulk dual on AdS$_5. We perform a detailed analysis of the one-loop fluctuations around the maximal giants (the fixed points)

## 1. Scalar field source Teleparallel Robertson-Walker F(T)-gravity solutions

**Authors:** Alexandre Landry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13895v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a scalar field source. The new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications in dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy and quintom models of physical processes. For $k=0$, we find an easy-to-compute $F (T) $ solution formula applicable for any scalarField source. We obtain, for $k=-1$ and $+1$ situations, some new analytical $F('T') solutions, only for specific $n$-parameter values.

## 2. Disclinations, dislocations, and emanant flux at Dirac criticality

**Authors:** Maissam Barkeshli, Christopher Fechisin, Zohar Komargodski, Siwei Zhong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13866v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13866v1)

**Summary:**

Topological quantum numbers specify the action of lattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. We find that disclinations and dislocations -- defects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a certain quantized magnetic flux. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold leading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive numerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and we test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail.

## 3. Rademacher expansion of modular integrals

**Authors:** Marco Maria Baccianti, Jeevan Chandra, Lorenz Eberhardt, Thomas Hartman, Sebastian Mizera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13827v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13827v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a method to evaluate integrals of non-holomorphic modular functions over the fundamental domain of the torus. It proceeds in two steps: first the integral is transformed to a Lorentzian contour, and then we apply a two-dimensional version of the Rademacher expansion. We apply this technique to a variety of examples such as the evaluation of string one-loop partition functions, where it leads to the first analytic formula for the cosmological constants of the bosonic string.

## 4. Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB   Power Spectra

**Authors:** Gabriele Montefalcone, Benjamin Wallisch, Katherine Freese

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13788v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13788v1)

**Summary:**

Neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. We detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements.

## 5. Naked and truly naked rotating black holes

**Authors:** H. V. Ovcharenko, O. B. Zaslavskii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13719v1)

**Summary:**

In some space-times with Killing horizons some curvature components, responsible for tidal forces, become enhanced from the viewpoint of a falling observer. This leads to the notion of so-called naked black holes. Previous results included static spherically symmetric or distorted static metrics. In the present work, we generalized them to include rotation in consideration. We also scrutiny how the algebraic type can change in the vicinity of the horizon due to local Lorentz boost. We analyze the behavior of Weyl scalar for different kinds of observers.

## 6. Effective string description of the reconfined phase in the trace   deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2+1) dimensions

**Authors:** Caludio Bonati, Michele Caselle, Alessio Negro, Dario Panfalone, Lorenzo Verzichelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13684v1)

**Summary:**

We study the behaviour of the flux tube in the reconfined phase of the trace deformed Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. In this phase the Polyakov loop has a vanishing expectation value (and center symmetry is recovered) even at high temperatures. We show that its behaviour is very different from that of usual confining gauge models and shows a remarkable agreement with the predictions of the so called "rigid string" In the limit in which the rigidity term (i.e. a term proportional to the square of the extrinsic curvature of the string) is very large and is the dominant contribution in the action.

## 7. On thermodynamics of charged and accelerating black holes

**Authors:** Tomáš Hale, David Kubizňák, Jana Menšíková, Robert B. Mann, Jiayue Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13679v1)

**Summary:**

We reconsider various C-metric spacetimes describing charged and (slowly) accelerating AdS black holes in different theories of (non-linear) electrodynamics. Focusing first on the Maxwell theory, we find a parametrization of the metric where we can eliminate the non-trivial `normalization' of the boost Killing vector. We also calculate the Euclidean action using i) the standard holographic renormalization and ii) using the topological renormalized.

## 8. Exploring gravitational impulse via quantum Boltzmann equation

**Authors:** Mohammad Sharifian, Moslem Zarei, Nicola Bartolo, Sabino Matarrese

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE) The initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE equation operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Through this procedure, we obtain the leading order of the system's impulse. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.

## 9. Antiquity, Dark Ages and Renaissance of Light-Front Higher Spin Theory

**Authors:** Anders K H Bengtsson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13674v1)

**Summary:**

The text has been in the making for many years. Some of it was written inspired by the Lars Brink 70-fest at The Solvay Institute in Brussels in 2014, but was never finished or published. Parts of the old text has now been replaced by a review of the quite unexpected recent renaissance for light-front higher spin theory. Lars sadly did not live to experience more than the very beginnings of this quite remarkable development. The text was finalized in the spring of 2023.
