## 0. Magnetar field dynamics shaped by chiral anomalies and helicity

**Authors:** Clara Dehman, José A. Pons

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06196v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06196v1)

**Summary:**

The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum chiral anomaly. The magnetic helicity acts as a persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales. Focusing on the neutron star crust, we show that this mechanism reshapes the magnetic field configuration inherited at birth and, within a hundred years, amplifies both toroidal and poloidal large-scale dipolar components (relevant for spin-down) up to $10^{14$ G.

## 1. Noncommutative fields in Reissner-Nordström black hole background

**Authors:** Milorad Bežanić, Marija Dimitrijević Ćirić, Nikola Konjik, Biljana Nikolić, Andjelo Samsarov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06181v1)

**Summary:**

In this short paper we discuss dynamics of noncommutative (NC) matter fields in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole background. We present equations of motion for the NC gravitational field obtained in two different models: $SO(2,3)_\star$ NC gravity and braided NC gravity. The obtained NC gravity equations are the starting point to discuss the propagation of NC gravitational perturbations and the validity of the dual description in terms of the effective metric.

## 2. Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in   D-foamy space-times

**Authors:** Chengyi Li, Bo-Qiang Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121v1)

**Summary:**

The absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated. We show that these constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from supercritical string theory. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases that charged quanta such as electrons do not radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.

## 3. Instantons and Vermas: the Abelian Case

**Authors:** Boan Zhao, Paul Luis Roehl, Chunhao Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06075v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06075v1)

**Summary:**

We study the action of instanton operators on the BPS Hilbert space of 5d maximal super Yang-Mills. We compute the matrix elements ofInstanton operators using supersymmetric localisation on the spacetime C2 times [0, 1] with an omega-background along C2. The computations lead to an uplift of the commutation relationships of instant on operators on equivariant cohomology to K-theory. Finally, we reproduce a U(1) version of the AGT correspondence.

## 4. Scattering Entanglement Entropy and Its Implications for Electroweak   Phase Transitions

**Authors:** Jia Liu, Masanori Tanaka, Xiao-Ping Wang, Jing-Jun Zhang, Zifan Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06001v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06001v1)

**Summary:**

The maximum of the entanglement entropy in scattering amplitudes may serve as a diagnostic for first-order electroweak phase transitions in the early universe. We analyze a simplified extension of the Standard Model consisting of the Higgs boson $h$ coupled to $O(N)$ real singlet scalars $S$ via Higgs portal coupling. We demonstrate that both first- order and strong first-orders of phase transitions are favored in regions of parameter space with large maximum entropy.

## 5. Periodic Kerr solution as an infinite soliton chain

**Authors:** Dmitry Korotkin, Javier Peraza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05698v1)

**Summary:**

The periodic analog of the Schwarzschild solution is known to be regular and exhibit Kasner asymptotic behaviour for an arbitrary size of event horizon not exceeding the period. We apply an efficient numerical approach based on the inverse scattering method, interpreting the periodic Kerr solution as an infinite chain of solitons. This allows to completely describe the existence domain in the space of physical parameters (the period, mass and the angular momentum) We study the dependence of Kasner exponent and the shape of the ergosphere on parameters of the problem.
