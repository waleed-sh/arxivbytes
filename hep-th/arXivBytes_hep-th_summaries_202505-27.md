## 0. Bulk Reconstruction of Scalar Excitations in Flat$_3$/CCFT$_2$ and the   Flat Limit from (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$

**Authors:** Peng-Xiang Hao, Kotaro Shinmyo, Yu-ki Suzuki, Shunta Takahashi, Tadashi Takayanagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20084v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the reconstruction of bulk local states in three-dimensional flat spacetime (Flat$_3$) using states from two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field theories (CCFT$_2$) For massive scalar-type bulk excitations, reconstruction is achieved through states in the induced representation. This method successfully reproduces the bulk massive Scalar spectrum and the bulk-to-bulk propagator. We identify a new flat limit from AdS$_4$ and dS$4$ spacetimes, further validating our proposal for scalar reconstruction.

## 1. Notes on Rindler wave packets in Minkowski spacetime

**Authors:** Shono Shibuya, Sotaro Sugishita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20078v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20078v1)

**Summary:**

We consider wave packets of a massless scalar field that have well-localized Rindler energy. We examine how their energy appears to a Minkowski observer to see how the classical gravitational blue-shift formula is modified quantum mechanically. We derive, by using the saddle point approximation, an analytic expression for the Minksowski momentum distribution. We find a universal lower bound on the uncertainty of Minkswowski momentum. The momentum distribution can never become arbitrarily sharp, we conclude.

## 2. Ultra-Planckian Quark and Gluon Scattering in Agravity

**Authors:** I. F. Cunha, A. C. Lehum

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19957v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks and gluons mediated by graviton exchange. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV- complete extension of general relativity.

## 3. Explicit classes in Habiro cohomology

**Authors:** Stavros Garoufalidis, Campbell Wheeler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19885v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a cycle description of the Habiro cohomology of a smooth variety $X$ over the spectrum $B$ of an \'etale $Z[\lambda]$-algebra. We construct explicit   nontrivial cycles using either the Picard-Fuchs equation on $X/B$   of a hypergeometric motive. Our methods give a unified treatment of   quantum $K$-theory and complex Chern-Simons theory around higher dimensional   critical loci.

## 4. Effective potential of scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics

**Authors:** M. J. Neves

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19881v1)

**Summary:**

The Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is so coupled to a complex scalar field sector in 1+2 dimensions. The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-wick mass. The study of effective potential for the Lee- wick pseudo electrodynamic in one-loop is presented in this letter.

## 5. Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations

**Authors:** Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Haruki Yamashita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861v1)

**Summary:**

We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation. The conventional constant 1/4 is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient with the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator. Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus, thereby generalizing the Arthurs-Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.

## 6. Gauge symmetry breaking with $S^2$ extra dimensions

**Authors:** Kento Asai, Yuki Honda, Hiroki Ishikawa, Joe Sato, Yasutaka Takanishi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19829v1)

**Summary:**

We consider symmetry breaking of arbitrary gauge groups on a six-dimensional space-time. We analyze Kaluza-Klein(KK) modes of the gauge fields and derive the mass spectrum of the KK modes. We find that the gauge field (not) commuting with the background fields (do not) remain symmetry operators in four dimensions. As a result, we obtain a method to break gauge symmetry due to the nontrivial solution for gauge fields which is a unique feature of $S^2$.

## 7. Mirror Symmetry and Spinor-Vector Duality: A Top-Down Approach to the   Swampland Program

**Authors:** Alon E. Faraggi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19817v1)

**Summary:**

Mirror symmetry is one of the celebrated developments in pure mathematics that arose from an initial observation in worldsheet string constructions. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror symmetry that can be readily understood in terms of the moduli parameters of toroidal heterotic-string compactifications. It is conjectured that SVD provides a demarcation line between (2,0) EFTs that possess an ultra-violet complete embedding in string theory versus those that do not.

## 8. Gravitational wave cosmology

**Authors:** Ligong Bian, Rong-Gen Cai, Yu-Qi Dong, Qing Gao, Yungui Gong, Zong-Kuan Guo, Qing-Guo Huang, Zhaofeng Kang, Li Li, Jing Liu, Lang Liu, Yu-Xiao Liu, Xuchen Lu, Zhi-Zhang Peng, Jin Qiao, Puxun Wu, Yue-Liang Wu, Jiang-Hao Yu, Chen Yuan, Chao Zhang, Tao Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19747v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves (GWs) originating from cosmological sources offer direct insights into the physics of the primordial Universe, the fundamental nature of gravity, and the cosmic expansion of the Universe. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive overview of our recent advances in GW cosmology, supported by the national key research and development program of China. We then analyze how GWs are affected by large-scale structure,cosmological perturbations, and possible modifications of gravity on GW propagation.

## 9. Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals   exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points

**Authors:** Ipsita Mandal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19636v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19636v1)

**Summary:**

We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.

## 10. Asymptotic gauge symmetry and UV extension of the nonperturbative   coupling in holographic QCD

**Authors:** Guy F. de Teramond, Arpon Paul, Hans Gunter Dosch, Stanley J. Brodsky, Alexandre Deur, Tianbo Liu, Raza Sabbir Sufian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19545v1)

**Summary:**

We extend our recent analytic study of the strong coupling. We impose rigorous renormalization-group results from asymptotically free gauge theories. For color $SU(3)$, a precise connection is found between the scaling exponent of $\kappa(Q^2)$ in the ultraviolet and the number of flavors in agreement with observations. The nonperturbative analytic model gives an accurate description of theStrong coupling at all scales, up to the highest available data, we say.

## 11. Quantum parameter-mass induced scalarization of qOS-black hole in the   Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19450v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain quantum parameter ($\alpha$)-mass ($M$) induced spontaneous scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the unknown qOS action. We derive Smarr formula which describes a correct thermodynamics for the bald qOS-black hole. This work is considered as the first example to show a close connection between thermodynamics of bald black hole and spontaneous scalerization.

## 12. 2d Cardy-Rabinovici model with the modified Villain lattice: Exact   dualities and symmetries

**Authors:** Nagare Katayama, Yuya Tanizaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19412v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19412v1)

**Summary:**

The Cardy-Rabinovici model is a toy model of the lattice $U(1)$ gauge theories. We reformulate the $2$d version of this model using the modified Villain lattice formalism. We establish the exact periodicity for the Witten effect and the strong-weak duality at the finite lattice spacings. We then study the phase structure of the model based on the duality, symmetry and anomaly, and the perturbative renormalization group.
