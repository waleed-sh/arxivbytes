## Non-local positivity bounds: islands in Terra Incognita

**Authors:** Luca Buoninfante, Long-Qi Shao, Anna Tokareva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08634v1)

**Summary:**

The requirements of unitarity and causality lead to significant constraints on the Wilson coefficients of a EFT expansion. The scope of this work is to clarify the role of locality by deriving generalized positivity bounds under the assumption of exponential boundedness. Our results have far-reaching implications for the question of the uniqueness of string theory as the only consistent ultraviolet completion beyond the framework of local QFT. We show that there exist ETFs that satisfy IR causality and at the same time can admit a non-local UV completion, provided the energy scale of non-locality is of the same order or smaller than the EFT cutoff.

## Primitive asymptotics in $φ^4$ vector theory

**Authors:** Paul-Hermann Balduf, Johannes Thürigen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08617v1)

**Summary:**

A longstanding conjecture in QFT is that primitive graphs dominate the beta function asymptotically at large loop order in the minimal-subtraction scheme. Here we investigate this issue by exploiting additional combinatorial structure coming from an extension to vectors with $O(N)$ symmetry. We find that the leadingAsymptotic growth rate becomes visible only above $approx 25$ loops, while data at lower order is suggestive of a wrong asymPTotics. We give bounds on the degree in $N$ for primitive and non-primitive graphs, and construct the primitive graphs of highest degree explicitly.

## A stress tensor for asymptotically flat spacetime

**Authors:** Jay Bhambure, Hare Krishna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08588v1)

**Summary:**

The stress tensor correctly reproduces the Brown-York charges for the Kerr blackhole i.e. mass and angular momentum. The asymptotic charges can be compared with the Wald-Zoupas method. Our result can be interpreted as the expectation value for the boundary stress Tensor of a gravitational theory in flat spacetime. We also compute the charges associated with these symmetries with the proposed stress tensors. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## pp-Waves and the Hidden Symmetries of Black Hole Quasinormal Modes

**Authors:** Daniel Kapec, Ahmed Sheta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08551v1)

**Summary:**

There are two interesting classes of trapped null geodesics in any black hole spacetime: those that lie on the photon ring and those that generate the horizon. Recent work introduced a "near-ring" scaling limit that exhibits the emergent symmetries of the eikonal quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum. This analysis was reformulated geometrically by Fransen using the Penrose limit, which produces pp-waves fromGeodesics. We elaborate on and generalize various aspects of this construction for the Schwarzschild black hole.

## Thermodynamics and DC conductivity of 2D anisotropic fluids from axion   holography

**Authors:** Alfonso Ballon-Bayona, Jonathan P. Shock, Dimitrios Zoakos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08538v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. We show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the an isotropy parameter. We analyse the DC conductivity of the fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking.

## Invariant Stability Conditions on Certain Calabi-Yau Threefolds

**Authors:** Tom Bridgeland, Fabrizio Del Monte, Luca Giovenzana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08531v1)

**Summary:**

We apply results on inducing stability conditions to local Calabi-Yau threefolds and obtain applications to Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory. We use a result of Dell to construct stability conditions on the derived category of $X$ for which all stable objects can be explicitly described. These stability conditions were first discussed in the physics literature by Closset and del Zotto, and were constructed mathematically by Xiong by a different method. We conclude that they define analytic wall-crossing structures in the sense of Kontsevich and Soibelman.

## Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy

**Authors:** Jiayue Yang, Niayesh Afshordi, Mahdi Torabian, Seyed Akbar Jafari, G. Baskaran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08517v1)

**Summary:**

In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. We compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one.

## Fermions hard scattering from superstrings

**Authors:** Lucas Martin, Martin Parlanti, Martin Schvellinger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08425v1)

**Summary:**

High-energy scattering at fixed angle in the planar limit of non-Abelian gauge field theories from type IIB superstring theory scattering amplitudes. We explicitly calculate some angular integrals of four scalar spherical harmonics on the five sphere leading to selection rules for several scattering processes. In both cases the partonic structure of the scattering cross sections is obtained. The Regge behavior is also obtained. In addition, we study certain related aspects by considering the effective action constructed from IIBsupergravity.

## Particle production in a light-cone gauge fixed Jordanian deformation of   $AdS_5\times S^5$

**Authors:** Riccardo Borsato, Sibylle Driezen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08411v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a string on a Jordanian deformation of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ spacetime. This model belongs to the larger class of Homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations. We discuss this unexpected result in relation to the property of Lax integrability of the sigma-model. We also show that the light-cone gauge-fixed Hamiltonian, under a perturbative field expansion, includes cubic terms that give rise to non-trivial cubic processes for physical particles.

## A new class of semiclassical gravity solutions, gravitational quantum   stealths and regular Cauchy horizons

**Authors:** Benito A. Juárez-Aubry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402v1)

**Summary:**

We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the system is quasi-linear hyperbolic. If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship. We provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassicals gravity without spacetime symmetries.

## Simplex tensor network renormalization group for boundary theory of 3+1D   symTFT

**Authors:** Kaixin Ji, Lin Chen, Li-Ping Yang, Ling-Yan Hung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08374v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08374v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a symmetry-preserving renormalization group (RG) flow for 3D symmetric theories. These theories are expressed as boundary conditions of a symTFT. The boundary is geometrically organized into tetrahedra and represented as a tensor network. By linearly interpolating between three topological fixed-point boundaries, we map the phase transitions characterized by local and non-local order parameters, which respectively detects the breaking of a 0-form and a 2-form symmetry.

## Geodesics, accretion disk, gravitational lensing, time delay, and   effects on neutrinos induced by a non-commutative black hole

**Authors:** A. A. Araújo Filho, N. Heidari, Ali Övgün

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08369v1)

**Summary:**

This paper explores gravitational phenomena associated with a non-commutative black hole. Geodesic equations are derived, and a thin accretion disk is analyzed to model the black hole shadow image. Retrolensing effects are examined to trace photon emission configurations. gravitational lensing is investigated through weak and strong deflection limits, with lensing equations and observables applied to Sagittarius A*. The study also includes calculations of time delay, energy deposition rate from neutrino annihilation, phase and probability of neutrinos oscillation.

## Thermodynamic Behavior of $4D$ Regular Nonminimal Yang-Mills AdS Black   Hole

**Authors:** Mehdi Sadeghi, Faramarz Rahmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08337v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we present the black hole solution of the Einstein-Yang-Mills model incorporating a non-minimal coupling. We then explore the thermodynamic phase transitions of the black Hole within an extended phase space. Our findings reveal that altering the sign of the perturbation coefficient leads to a significant shift in the thermodynamics behavior of theblack hole. The black hole can transition between Van der Waals-like fluid phase transitions and Hawking-Page-like transitions. We present our findings in a paper published in the Journal of Theoretical Physics.

## On AdS$_4$ superspace and supergravity

**Authors:** Chen-Xu Han, Zhao-Long Wang, Yi Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08330v1)

**Summary:**

In the $N=1$ superspace, AdS$_4$ supersymmetry is realized as the non-linear super coordinate transformations. By introducing an auxiliary scalar coordinate, this representation is reformulated as a 5-dimensional linear representation. New linear representations are constructed by tensor products of multiple superspinors. Based on these linear representations, the supergravity action can be reproduced in a manifestly supers asymmetry-covariant way. For more information, see: http://www.fermionic.org/supersymmetry.

## On BRST Lagrangian formulation of massless higher spin fields

**Authors:** I. L. Buchbinder, S. A. Fedoruk, A. P. Isaev, V. A. Krykhtin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08298v1)

**Summary:**

The paper is dedicated to the blessed memory of Professor Vladislav Gavrilovich Bagrov, an outstanding Russian scientist in the area of theoretical and mathematical physics. Two of the authors of this paper (I.L.B and V.A.K) are to one degree or another grateful to Professor V.G. Bagrov for comprehensive support in the initial period of their scientific career. We demonstrate in details the simplicity and clearity of the Lagrangian formulation for free four-dimensional massless higher-spin fields.

## The Vanishing of the Non-linear Static Love Number of Kerr Black Holes   and the Role of Symmetries

**Authors:** L. -R. Gounis, A. Kehagias, A. Riotto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08249v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08249v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the tidal response of Kerr black holes in four-dimensional space-times subjected to external gravitational fields. Using the Ernst formalism and Weyl coordinates, we analyze the non-linear tidal deformation of rotating black holes. We show that their static tidal Love numbers vanish at all orders of the external tidal field. We also show that this result is intimately related to the presence of underlying non- linear symmetries. Our analysis generalizes previous findings for Schwarzschild black holes and confirms the robustness of four- dimensional black holes against tidal forces.

## States and IR divergences in factorization algebras

**Authors:** Masashi Kawahira, Tomohiro Shigemura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08183v1)

**Summary:**

In factorization algebras, we often use a natural augmentation state. In physics, we use a state given by compactification of spacetime. At first glance, the relation between these three states is not so clear. In this paper, propose a definition of compactification method in factorizationAlgebraes and give a way to treat IR divergences in massless theory. As a result, we see the three sates are equivalent both in massive theory and massless Theory.

## On the photon mass generation in Rarita-Schwinger QED

**Authors:** M. Ghasemkhani, G. Soleimani, A. Soto, R. Bufalo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08168v1)

**Summary:**

This work examines the dynamical mass generation for the photon in Rarita-Schwinger QED. The presence of higher-derivative terms is shown as the leading contributions to the $1$PI function at one-loop order. We present some remarks about the renormalizability of this model (in different dimensions) due to the presence ofHigher-Derivative corrections at the one- loop. We study the pole structure of the photon's complete propagator to unveil the main effects of the Raritaswinger fields on the photons mass.

## Effective description of open quantum dynamics in relativistic   scattering

**Authors:** Kaito Kashiwagi, Akira Matsumura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08154v1)

**Summary:**

Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator describes the evolution of the particles. The GKSL generator is characterized by a Lorentz-invariant function of initial momenta. In the pair annihilation process, we show that the probability of pair annihilation varies depending on the superposition state of incident scalar $phi$ particles. This means that the description by the GK SL generator with Poincar\'e symmetry is effective for the asymptotic behavior of open quantum dynamics in the long-term processes.

## Anomalies and D-branes in the Dabholkar-Park background

**Authors:** Hiroki Wada, Satoshi Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08056v1)

**Summary:**

We consider D-branes in the Dabholkar-Park (DP) background, a $9$d orientifold theory obtained by gauging symmetry in the type~IIB string theory compactified on a circle. Using anomalies in the world-sheet theory, we provide physical insights into the classification of stable D- Branes by relative KR-theory. The spectrum of D-Branes characterized by the relative KR -theory is correctly reproduced from the D- brane states.

## Geometric Deformation of Quantum Mechanics

**Authors:** Ivan G. Avramidi, Roberto Niardi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08007v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a novel approach to Quantum Mechanics that we call Curved Quantum Mechanics. In this approach, a state of a quantum system is described by a point in the cotangent bundle of the state manifold. We show that in the case of negative curvature there is a bifurcation at a critical value of the curvature. This means that for small mass all modes are in the quantum regime with the unitary periodic dynamics. For large mass there are classical modes, with not a periodic but rather an exponential time evolution leading to a collapse.

## Geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired spacetime

**Authors:** Douglas M. Gingrich, Saeed Rastgoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08004v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical curvature singularity. In Schwarzschild coordinates, the $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition surface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic congruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $ r = 0$, indicating a repulsive gravitational core.
