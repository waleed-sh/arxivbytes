## 0. A New $\sim 5Ïƒ$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI DR1   and DES-SN5YR observations

**Authors:** Purba Mukherjee, Anjan A Sen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02880v1)

**Summary:**

We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_A) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. We derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts.

## 1. Conservative Dynamics of Relativistic Binaries Beyond Einstein Gravity

**Authors:** Jordan Wilson-Gerow

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02867v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of spinless compact objects in a general effective theory of gravity. We compute the radial action in a post-Minkowskian approximation for scattering orbits, to two-loop order. The result encodes the fully relativistic dynamics of the compact objects, and serves as a generating function for gauge-invariant orbital observables for both bound and unbound binary systems. Where overlapping post-Newtonian results are available, we've verified agreement. We also study a general multi-scalar-tensor theory ofgravity to order $\ell^{4}.

## 2. Four-point correlators with BPS bound states in AdS$_3$ and AdS$_5$

**Authors:** Francesco Aprile, Stefano Giusto, Rodolfo Russo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02855v1)

**Summary:**

We consider heavy-heavy-light-light (HHLL) correlators in AdS/CFT. When $n$ is of order of the central charge, we show that the bulk equation that computes our boundary HHLL correlators is always a Heun equation. Focussing on the AdS$_5$ case, we study the OPE expansion of these multi-particle correlators and show that several consistency relations with known CFT data are non-trivially satisfied.

## 3. Bosonizations and dualities in 2+1 dimensions

**Authors:** Andrea Cappelli, Riccardo Villa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02801v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02801v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss two methods for relating bosonic and fermionic field theories in 2+1 dimensions. The first is primarily a correspondence between topological theories. The second method,flux attachment, gives spin and statistics to charged particles by coupling them to a Chern-Simons theory. We illustrate the two bosonizations with explicit results in a solvable semiclassical conformal theory, and show their differences and interplays with particle-vortex dualities. We employ the so-called loop model, which can describe general infrared critical points in 2-1 dimensions in the semiclassicals limit.

## 4. Vacua, Symmetries, and Higgsing of Chern-Simons Matter Theories

**Authors:** Fabio Marino, Marcus Sperling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02744v1)

**Summary:**

Three-dimensional supersymmetric Chern-Simons Matter (CSM) theories can exhibit enhanced supersymmetry under special conditions. A detailed understanding of the moduli space of CSM theories, however, has remained elusive. This paper addresses this gap by systematically analysing the maximal branches of theModuli space. It is based on the Type IIB brane constructions of the CSM theory, as well as two magnetic quivers for each maximal (hyper-K\"ahler) branch.

## 5. Can Horndeski Genesis be Nonpathological?

**Authors:** Han Gil Choi, Pavel Petrov, Masahide Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02626v1)

**Summary:**

We present a minimal setup within the framework of Horndeski gravity that can describe a nonpathological Genesis scenario. Our setup allows for a fully stable transition to the kination epoch, during which General Relativity is restored. This Genesis scenario circumvents the no-go theorem at the cost of encountering the risk of strong coupling in the past. We also suggest a deformation of the model that enables us to achieve sufficiently small values for the r ratio. Finally, we discuss the geodesic (in)completeness of the current model.

## 6. Investigating (Non)-Integrability and Pulsating String in D3-Brane   Background

**Authors:** Rashmi R. Nayak, Kamal L. Panigrahi, Manoranjan Samal, Balbeer Singh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02548v1)

**Summary:**

This work explores the (non)-integrability and chaotic dynamics of classical strings in the background of a D3-brane. We demonstrate that the non-commutative parameter enhances chaotic behavior. We investigate the integrability of geodesic motion and identify two distinct string modes: capture and escape to infinity. Finally, we study pulsatingstrings in the deformed deformed background, deriving dispersion relations for both short and long strings, and analyzing their stability through perturbation theory.

## 7. Row and column detection complexities of character tables

**Authors:** Adrian Padellaro, Sanjaye Ramgoolam, Rak-Kyeong Seong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02543v1)

**Summary:**

Character tables of finite groups and closely related commutative algebras have been investigated recently using new perspectives. Two important elements in these new perspectives are physically motivated definitions of quantum complexity and a notion of row-column duality. We observe regularities that arise in the statistical averages over small character tables and propose corresponding conjectures for arbitrarily large character tables. We define row and column versions of detection complexities for character tables, and investigate the relation between these complexities under the exchange of rows and columns.

## 8. Nonadiabatic quantum kinetic equations and Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner   formalism for Schwinger pair production in time-varying electric fields with   multiple components

**Authors:** Z. L. Li, R. Z. Jiang, Y. J. Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02530v1)

**Summary:**

The nonadiabatic quantum kinetic equations and Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism for Schwinger pair production in a spatially uniform and time-varying electric field with multiple components are derived and proven to be equivalent. By analyzing the time evolution of the distribution functions of particles created in a circularly polarized Gaussian pulse field with a subcycle structure, it is found the two distribution functions are the same after the field, with a sufficient number of oscillation cycles, fades away.

## 9. Quantum work extraction of a moving battery as a witness to Unruh   thermality in high-dimensional spacetimes

**Authors:** Yan Chen, Wei-Wei Zhang, Tian-Xi Ren, Xiang Hao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02472v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02472v1)

**Summary:**

The study looked at the thermal nature of the Unruh effect in a high dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In the massless scalar field, the evolution with a small acceleration takes on a unique monotonicity in $D=3$ dimensional spacetime and changes to a decaying oscillation for other higher dimensions. The increase in spacetime dimensionality can increase the energy storage capacity of the moving battery. If the mass of the field is considered, the related quantum work extraction is so robust that the high values can keep for a very long time.

## 10. Late Time Cosmic Acceleration in Modified Gravity and Gauss-Bonnet   Cosmology

**Authors:** Santosh V. Lohakare

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02467v1)

**Summary:**

Late-time acceleration of the Universe has posed a significant challenge to contemporary cosmology. General relativity addresses this by introducing the cosmological constant. This model has limitations, leading cosmologists to explore alternative explanations. These alternatives range from models involving a dynamic dark fluid known as dark energy, to large-scale modifications of gravitational interaction, known as modified gravity. This thesis focuses on late-time cosmic acceleration within modified theories of gravity, using various observational data sets and statistical analysis. The Universe is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic and is described by the Friedmann Lema Lema Robertson Walker metric.

## 11. Timelike Compton scattering on a spin-0 target with kinematic twist-4   precision

**Authors:** V. Martinez-Fernandez, B. Pire, P. Sznajder, J. Wagner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02461v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the kinematic twist-3 and 4 corrections to the leading order amplitude of timelike Compton scattering (TCS) on a (pseudo-)scalar target. We compare the effects of higher twist contributions to TCS with those in deeply virtual Compton scattering. Our estimates indicate that these contributions are sizeable and will play a crucial role in the interpretation of data from current and forthcoming experiments. The results are based on a $\pi$-meson GPD model, based on the conformal operator-product expansion.

## 12. Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supergravity

**Authors:** Ioseph Buchbinder, Evgeny Ivanov, Nikita Zaigraev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02438v1)

**Summary:**

We review the superfield formulation of higher-spin supergravity theory in harmonic superspace. The analysis of both the hypermultiplet higher- spin supersymmetries and conformal supersymmetry is performed. Based on these results, the consistent interaction of an infinite tower of superconformal higher spins with hypermultIPlet is presented. We then propose a method to construct a consistent interacting theory of $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher- Spin supergravity by making use of the conformal compensators.

## 13. Non-split superstrings of dimension $(1|2)$

**Authors:** Dimitry Leites, Alexander S. Tikhomirov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02416v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02416v1)

**Summary:**

Any supermanifold diffeomorphic to one whose structure sheaf is the sheaf of sections of a~ vector bundle over the underlying manifold is called split. Gaw\c{e}dzki (1977) and Batchelor (1979) were the first to prove that any smooth superman ifold is split. In 1981, P.~Green, and Palamodov, found examples of non-split analytic super manifolds and described obstructions to splitness.

## 14. Cosmic Acceleration from Nothing

**Authors:** Michael R. R. Good, Eric V. Linder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02380v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate that if the universe started as a vacuum fluctuation rather than from a singular Big Bang state, the universe must have a late-time cosmic acceleration. This is required by a ``cosmological sum rule'' derived using the Schwarzian form of the Friedmann equations. We discuss possible connections to conformal and M\"obius transformations, and also compute that the best fit present cosmic data is consistent with the necessary crossing of the Schwartzian through zero having occurred (while it would not yet have happened in a $CDM cosmology)

## 15. Alternative Framework to Quantize Fermionic Fields

**Authors:** Jianhao M. Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02362v1)

**Summary:**

In quantum field theory, the quantization of classical fields is traditionally achieved through canonical quantization or the Feynman path integral formalism. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach based on the extended stationary action principle. We apply it to the weak interaction theory of fermionic fields, which is non-renormalizable under standard quantization. Our approach leads to a non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the wave functional, offering new insights into the quantized theories.

## 16. Charges in light cones and quenched infrared radiation

**Authors:** Detlev Buchholz, Fabio Ciolli, Giuseppe Ruzzi, Ezio Vasselli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02342v1)

**Summary:**

The creation of electrically charged states and the resulting electromagnetic fields are considered in space-time regions in which such experiments can actually be carried out. The results show that the restrictions of operations and observations to light cones, which are dictated by the arrow of time, amount to a Lorentz-invariant infrared cutoff. This is consistent with the fact that there is no evidence for the existence of longitudinal photons. They are quenched and the observed radiation can be described by states in the Fock space of photons.

## 17. Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from   local geometrical invariants and matter distributions

**Authors:** Takahisa Igata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We propose a novel analytical framework that connects its physical origin to local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities and properties of the matter distributions. This finding not only accounts for the behavior observed in the Schwarzschild spacetime but also provides a unified description applicable to a variety of spacetime, including naked singularities and wormholes supported by a massless scalar field.

## 18. Shadows aspect of rotating black holes in the Einstein-AdS   SU(N)-nonlinear sigma model

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi, Y. Sekhmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02179v1)

**Summary:**

Recent observations of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have opened new avenues for testing gravity theories through black hole shadow observables. These observations offer a means to distinguish between general relativity and modified gravity theories while providing insights into the astrophysical properties of the observed black holes. In this work, we investigate photon orbits and shadow characteristics of rotating black holes within the Einstein-$\mathrm{SU(N)}$ nonlinear sigma model.
