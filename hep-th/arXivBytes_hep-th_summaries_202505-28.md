## 0. 5-Dimensional Gravitational Raman Scattering: Scalar Wave Perturbations   in Schwarzschild-Tangherlini Spacetime

**Authors:** Samim Akhtar, Yilber Fabian Bautista, Cristoforo Iossa, Zihan Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21489v1)

**Summary:**

In this Letter, we study scalar wave perturbations of arbitrary frequency to the 5D Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole (STBH) within general relativity. For the first time, we derive a closed formula for the5D partial wave gravitational Raman scattering amplitude applicable to a broad class of boundary conditions. We compute the dynamical and static Love numbers of the STBH by matching an effective field theory description. The matched Love numbers do not vanish and present renormalization group running behavior.

## 1. Representations of the fractional d'Alembertian and initial conditions   in fractional dynamics

**Authors:** Gianluca Calcagni, Giuseppe Nardelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21485v1)

**Summary:**

We construct representations of complex powers of the d'Alembertian operator in Lorentzian signature. We pinpoint one which is self-adjoint and suitable for classical and quantum fractional field theory. We generalize this result to a much wider class of nonlocal theories and discuss its applications to quantum gravity. Using a cleaned-up version of the diffusion method, we formulate and solve the problem of initial conditions of the classical dynamics with a standard plus a fractional d' Alecptian.

## 2. Scalar field stochastic dynamics in de Sitter spacetime from exact   solutions of quantum deficient oscillators

**Authors:** Yuta Nasuda, Koki Tokeshi, Yuki Watanabe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429v1)

**Summary:**

The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactlysolvable double- well model is also presented.

## 3. Automation of a Matching On-Shell Calculator

**Authors:** Javier López Miras, Fuensanta Vilches

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21353v1)

**Summary:**

$mosca$ is a package designed to facilitate on-shell calculations in effective field theories (EFTs) The initial release focuses on the reduction of Green's bases to physical bases, as well as transformations between arbitrary operator bases. Planned future developments include extension to one-loop computations, thus providing support for EFT renormalization directly in a physical basis. The package, along with example notebooks and documentation, is available at: https://gitlab.com/matchingonshell/mosca.

## 4. Quantum harmonic oscillator, index theorem and anomaly

**Authors:** Shunrui Li, Yang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21348v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum anomalies are deeply connected to the renowned Atiyah-Singer (AS) index theorem. While often associated with fermionic systems, anomalies can also emerge in purely bosonic settings. In this paper, we explore a particularly simple example of such a case: the quantum harmonic oscillator. We investigate how its internal energy relates to the Atiyah/Singer index theorem, showing that the partition function can be interpreted as the Chern character of "physiacl sheaf" over Eucildean spacetime. We show that this connection naturally leads to the emergence of a quantum anomaly.

## 5. Generalized Collective Coordinate Quantization of Solitons with   Topological Terms

**Authors:** Taichi Tsukamoto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21345v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21345v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the $\theta+$ pentaquark does not exist in the Skyrme model. We propose a generalized collective coordinate quantization method and apply it to the SU(3) Skyrmion with the Wess- Zumino-Witten term. We find five constraints. These reproduce the results of [1] except the nucleon octet and $\Delta$ baryon decuplet from thebaryon spectrum. In addition, constraint zero modes do not have the kinetic term and produce constraints that strongly restrict the spectrum instead.

## 6. Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star   formation history profiles

**Authors:** Heinrich Steigerwald

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260v1)

**Summary:**

The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework. We apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae.

## 7. What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial   black holes or companion stars?

**Authors:** Heinrich Steigerwald

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256v1)

**Summary:**

Collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBHMass scale is unpredicted from first principles.

## 8. More on Slavnov Products of Spin Chains and KP Hierarchy Tau Functions

**Authors:** Thiago Araujo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21166v1)

**Summary:**

Connections between classical and quantum integrable systems are analyzed from the viewpoint of Slavnov products of Bethe states. Building on recent results on the structure of rational and trigonometric models, we show that, provided certain conditions are satisfied, the Slavnov product of a given model can be interpreted as a tau function of the KP hierarchy. We also prove that their homogeneous limit can be systematically expressed as a Wronskian of functions related to the eigenvalues of the transfer matrices.

## 9. Dyons in higher-dimensional gauge theories

**Authors:** Yuki Adachi, C. S. Lim, Nobuhito Maru

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21158v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the 't Hooft-Polyakov (TP) monopole and then dyon in the framework of the higher dimensional gauge theories, such as the gauge-Higgs unification models. We demonstrate that in the 5D gauge theories the Chern-Simons term is induced at the quantum level. We find that the obtained field configurations of non-BPS dyon and its mass are rather close to those of the B PS dyon. In addition, we propose a numerical method to obtain the field configurations and the mass of the non- BPS dyons by use of ``modified" gradient flow equations.

## 10. Euclidean wormholes stability analysis revisited

**Authors:** Donald Marolf, Bruno Missoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21118v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21118v1)

**Summary:**

Previous studies of stability of Euclidean axion wormholes found that symmetric modes suffered from divergences. We show that such divergence were an artifact of a particular way of solving the constraints. We also introduce a technique that allows us to show this positivity at a pseudo-analytic level that avoids heavy numerics. Our techniques should be useful to future studies of stabilities of other wormholes as well. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.

## 11. Warped G$_2$-throats in IIA and uplift dSillusions

**Authors:** Fotis Farakos, George Tringas, Thomas Van Riet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21104v1)

**Summary:**

Flux compactifications of IIA supergravity on orientifolded G$_2$-manifolds have been argued to allow for classical Minkowski$_3$ vacua with moduli. To further uplift these vacua using anti-D2 branes, warped throats are desirable. We find that uplifting from anti-branes down warped throats is forbidden. However, there is potentially an advantage over 4d when it comes to concrete fine-tuning freedom of numbers.

## 12. Covariant Fractons and Weitzenböck Torsion

**Authors:** Davide Rovere

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21022v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21022v1)

**Summary:**

The relation between covariant fracton gauge theory and Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji extension of teleparallel gravity is investigated. The former is the gauge theory of a rank two symmetric tensor with gauge symmetry given by the double derivative of a scalar parameter. The latter is a class of theories which generalises Einstein gravity, whose action is quadratic in the Weitzenbock torsion. We show that the solutions of the two theories can be viewed as solutions of Moller/Hayashi theory.

## 13. Parameter inference of microlensed gravitational waves using neural   spline flows

**Authors:** Zheng Qin, Tian-Yang Sun, Bo-Yuan Li, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xiao Guo, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20996v1)

**Summary:**

When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs.

## 14. Construction of Metaplectic Representations of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$   and Twisted Magnetic Translations

**Authors:** Emmanuel Floratos, Kimon Manolas, Ioannis Tsohantjis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20983v1)

**Summary:**

Unitary metaplectic representations are necessary to describe evolution of $2^n-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving $n$ qubits. We construct the general matrix form of such representations, together with appropriately defined magnetic translations based on the diagonal subgroup of the tensor product of the finite Heisenberg group. It is shown that in order for the meetingaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved $n-qubit Hilbert spaces, from $2 ^n$ to $2^{2n}$, is necessary.

## 15. Deciphering black hole phase transitions through photon spheres

**Authors:** Si-Jiang Yang, Shan-Ping Wu, Shao-Wen Wei, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20860v1)

**Summary:**

Black hole thermodynamics is a crucial and foundational aspect of black hole physics. The photon sphere of a black hole, a manifestation of strong gravitational effects, is intrinsically linked to its shadow. The change in the photon sphere radius can serve as an order parameter characterizing the black hole's phase transition. Investigating black hole thermodynamic from a gravitational perspective presents an intriguing avenue for research, the authors say. The paper investigates the relationship between the thermodynamic phase transition and the photon Sphere of ablack hole with quantum anomaly.

## 16. Violation of weak cosmic censorship by the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse

**Authors:** Il Gyeong Choi, Dong-han Yeom

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20724v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the possibility that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture can be violated using the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse model with a perfect fluid star interior. Metric models with a naked singularity can be used. In this case, gravitational collapse is allowed, but the null energy condition should be violated at the thin-shell. In conclusion, we could not find a physically viable model that violatesweak cosmic censorship, but it opens a window to study the properties of cosmic censorship constructively. The violation of strong cosmic censorship might be possible if a modified gravity model provides a solution.

## 17. Magnetically arrested transmutation of a compact star

**Authors:** H. A. Adarsha, Chandrachur Chakraborty, Sudip Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20722v1)

**Summary:**

 Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. We show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence ofordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900.

## 18. Integrable Non-Holonomic Constraints and Gauge Fixing in Classical Field   Theory

**Authors:** Ben Bert, William A. Horowitz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20684v1)

**Summary:**

The usual method for gauge fixing in classical and quantum field theories fails for general gauges that depend on the derivatives of the fields, such as the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges. The point of failure occurs at the use of the transposition rule in the derivation of the equations of motion from the extremization of the action. We define the concept of integrability of non-holonomic constraints in field theory and prove that the usual Transposition rule holds for theories with these constraints.

## 19. Holographic superconductor with dark matter probed by entanglement   entropy in higher dimensional AdS spacetime

**Authors:** Weiping Yao, Yifu Cai, Zehua Tian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20677v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) with dark matter in a higher-dimensional AdS black hole spacetime including full back reaction. By analyzing the HEE, we uncover distinct signatures of the metal/superconductor phase transition. The critical temperature is dynamically tuned by both the dark matter coupling strength and the chemical potential ratio between visible and dark matter sectors. The HEE exhibits a novel scaling behavior near the criticality. It grows linearly with the dark Matter coupling but displays a nonlinear, accelerated enhancement as the chemical Potential ratio between the Maxwell and dark Matter sectors increases.

## 20. Positive Mass in Scalar-Torsion Holography

**Authors:** Mulyanto, Hadyan Luthfan Prihadi, Emir Syahreza Fadhilla, Ardian Nata Atmaja

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20661v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the holographic renormalization of scalar-torsion gravity in a four-dimensional bulk spacetime with non-minimal derivative coupling. The existence of unique solutions throughout the bulk is addressed. Our results provide a formalism for finding non-tachyonic bulk scalar fields which vanish at the boundary. We show that the effective bulk mass can be tuned through the non-Minimal coupling. We study the effect on the conformal dimension and the expectation value of the dual scalar operator.

## 21. LSZ ghostbusters in the quadratic gravity stage

**Authors:** O. P. Santillán

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597v1)

**Summary:**

The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided. In order to be sure that unitarity is not violated, one should derived the LSZ rules for the model and check the absence of negative contributions to the $S$ matrix. This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit.

## 22. Inflationary power spectrum from the Lanczos algorithm

**Authors:** Ke-Hong Zhai, Lei-Hua Liu, Hai-Qing Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20595v1)

**Summary:**

The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.
