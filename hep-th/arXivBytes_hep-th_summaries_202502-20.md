## 0. Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties

**Authors:** Hunter Dinkins, Jiwu Jang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quasimap vertices of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertices can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions. This proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertices. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $ D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets.

## 1. The Starobinsky model of inflation and Renormalizability

**Authors:** Roberto Percacci, Gian Paolo Vacca

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13931v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13931v1)

**Summary:**

The Starobinsky model was born in a cosmological scenario where conformally coupled matter quantum field fluctuations on the vacuum drive a semiclassical energy momentum tensor quadratic in curvature. The presence of an unstable de Sitter solution contributed to spread the idea that the early universe could have experienced an inflationary epoch. Effective "$R + R^2$" models of gravity have later gained much attention since their predictions are in very good agreement with the measurements of CMB data.

## 2. Diagnosing chaos with projected ensembles of process tensors

**Authors:** Peter O'Donovan, Neil Dowling, Kavan Modi, Mark T. Mitchison

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13930v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13930v1)

**Summary:**

The process tensor provides a general representation of a quantum system evolving under repeated interventions. It is fundamental for numerical simulations of local many-body dynamics. In this work, we introduce the projected process ensemble, an ensemble of pure output states of a process Tensor in a given basis of local interventions. We discover characteristic entanglement structures within the ensemble's higher moments that can sharply distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics, overcoming deficiencies of the quantum dynamical and spatiotemporal entropies.

## 3. Holographic central charge for double scaled SYK

**Authors:** Paramesh Mahapatra, Hemant Rathi, Dibakar Roychowdhury

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13884v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13884v1)

**Summary:**

In the low energy limit, the gravity description flows into the ordinary JT gravity. This is a conjectured dual of ordinary Schwarzian quantum mechanics at strong coupling. We compute the associated central charge ($c_{JT}$), which reveals $c_{sDG}>c_JT$. We identify this as an artifact of the UV completion of JTgravity in terms of sine dilaton gravity. The study was published in the Journal of Physics and Astronomy.

## 4. Nonabelian fluids and helicities

**Authors:** Horatiu Nastase, Jacob Sonnenschein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13765v1)

**Summary:**

In analogy with the non-Abelian gauge helicities conserved in time for "null fields", we first define non- abelian fluid helicities and then total non-abelian helicities. For a U(N) group the helicities considered are for both gluonic-type fluids, composed of particles in the adjoint representation. We write down various Lagrangian formulations for the uncoupled and coupled systems. In each case we determine the equations of motion, symmetries, and a Hamiltonian formulation.

## 5. Astrophysical signals from the neighboring brane

**Authors:** Sergey G. Rubin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13761v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13761v1)

**Summary:**

The electromagnetic field is uniformly distributed over the extra dimensions, preserving charge universality in 4D physics. It is shown that the particles on different branes interact by exchanging photons and gravitons, which could explain the phenomena such as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and dark matter. The latter consists of heavy electrons that are located on a brane free of the observers. The hierarchy of the energy scales and the subsequent fine-tuning can be achieved for the brane populated by observers.

## 6. Variant dilaton Weyl Multiplet for N=3 conformal supergravity in four   dimensions

**Authors:** Soumya Adhikari, Aravind Aikot, Bindusar Sahoo, Madhu Mishra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13683v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13683v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a new dilaton Weyl multiplet for conformal supergravity in four dimensions. The construction follows a two-step procedure. Two on-shell vector multiplets are coupled to the standard Weylmultiplet. Some of the auxiliary fields of the standard multiplet are solved in terms of the fields belonging to the vectorMultiplets and some dual gauge fields. The remaining fields combine with the vector multiplet fields and the dual Gauge fields to constitute the new Dilaton Weyl multiplet.

## 7. Production of Dark Photons through Higher Electromagnetic Moments at   LDMX: Simulations and Model Discrimination

**Authors:** Riccardo Catena, Taylor R. Gray, Thomas Jerkvall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13635v1)

**Summary:**

LDMX Phase-II is expected to probe the relic target of these additional dark photon models. The potential for model discrimination in the scenario of non-zero signal events at LDMX is discussed. We find that there is a degeneracy between the dark photon mass and model, which can be partially broken by considering both the energy and the transverse momentum of the recoil electron. We compare the analytic with the numerical methods for calculating the dark bremsstrahlung cross section, and compute the kinematic distributions for each model.

## 8. Regular Schwarzschild black holes and cosmological models

**Authors:** Roberto Casadio, Alexander Kamenshchik, Jorge Ovalle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13627v1)

**Summary:**

We study regular Schwarzschild black holes in General Relativity as an alternative to the singular counterpart. We analyze two types of solutions which are completely parameterised by the ADM mass alone. Both families of regular solutions contain a de Sitter condensate at the core and admit (quasi) extremal black hole configurations. Cosmological models based on these regular configurations are also analyzed, finding that they describe non-trivial Kantowski-Sachs universes free of singularities.

## 9. Bound states of quasiparticles with quartic dispersion in an external   potential: WKB approach

**Authors:** E. V. Gorbar, V. P. Gusynin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13616v1)

**Summary:**

The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin semiclassical method is formulated for quasiparticles with quartic-in-momentum dispersion. It is shown that matching wave functions in the classically forbidden and allowed regions requires the consideration of higher-order Airy-type functions. The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials.

## 10. A new study of the interactions of the axion with mesons and photons   using a chiral effective Lagrangian model

**Authors:** Enrico Meggiolaro, Mirko Tamburini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13615v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13615v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we extend the results obtained in a previous work and investigate the most interesting decay processes involving axions, photons and the lightest pseudoscalar mesons. In particular, we compute the axion mass, the electromagnetic coupling of theAxion to photons, and the amplitudes and widths of the decay processes. We use a chiral effective Lagrangian model with $N_f=3$ light quark flavors, which also includes the flavor-singlet pseudosCalar meson and implements the axial anomaly of the fundamental theory.

## 11. Exact Results for SYM on $Y^{p,q}$ and $S^2\times S^2$ with Conical   Singularities

**Authors:** Lorenzo Ruggeri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13614v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the full partition function, including flux and instanton contributions, for an $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets on five-dimensional toric Sasakian manifolds $Y^{p,q}$. We obtain the partition function on a class of manifolds whose topology is $S^2\times S^2$, for equivariant Donaldson-Witten and Pestun-like theories. Generalizing the procedure to branched covers of $Y^2, we compute, for instance, a partition function of an $N=2$ theory on the product of two spindles.

## 12. B-type anomaly coefficients for the D3-D7 domain wall

**Authors:** Georgios Linardopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13613v1)

**Summary:**

We compute B-type Weyl anomaly coefficients for the two non-supersymmetric codimension-1 domain wall versions of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. We compute the two-point function of the (improved) energy-momentum tensor in the presence of the domain wall, to leading order in perturbation theory. From it, we determine the b2 anomaly coefficient for both domain wall systems. We conclude that both systems are holographically dual to the D3-D7 probe-brane system.

## 13. Codimension-Two Defects and SYM on Orbifolds

**Authors:** Roman Mauch, Lorenzo Ruggeri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13611v1)

**Summary:**

We study $U(N)$ SYM theories on spaces with orbifold singularities via an equivalent description in terms of gauge theories on smooth manifolds with insertions of Gukov-Witten and twist defects. We compute the partition function of the theory with defects on a patch and use it as a building block to compute partition functions on several closed spaces with conical singularities. This motivates an equivalence with theories on branched covers, for which the multivaluedness has a geometric interpretation.

## 14. Algebraic and Positive Geometry of the Universe: from Particles to   Galaxies

**Authors:** Claudia Fevola, Anna-Laura Sattelberger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13582v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13582v1)

**Summary:**

In recent years, the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics with particle physics and cosmology has led to significant advances. Central to this progress is the twofold formulation of the study of particle interactions and observables in the universe. This article introduces key developments, mathematical tools, and the connections that drive progress at the frontier between algebraic geometry, the theory of $D$- modules, and physics. All these threads contribute to shaping the flourishing field of positive geometry, which aims to establish a unifying mathematical language for describing phenomena in cosmology and particle physics.

## 15. Near-extremal dumb holes and some aspects of the Hawking effect

**Authors:** Akshat Pandey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13557v1)

**Summary:**

We propose novel non-relativistic fluid analogue models, that is dumb hole models, for extremal and near-extremal black holes. Further we study the back-reaction effects of analogue Hawking radiation emitted from these dumb holes. We speculate on the existence of an emergent Hawking force which leads to the reduction in the background fluid velocity and which is produced as a consequence of phonon emission. In addition to the analogue gravity literature, our results might be of relevance to black hole pedagogy.

## 16. On dimensions of (2+1)D abelian bosonic topological systems on   unoriented manifolds

**Authors:** Ippo Orii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13532v1)

**Summary:**

We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to unoriented surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we could assign Hilbert space with integer dimensions to un oriented surfaces in the case of abelians with time-reversal symmetry. We also show that this can be done in a number of other ways.

## 17. Yang-Mills theories at finite temperature quantized in linear covariant   gauges: gauge copies and semi-non-perturbative effects

**Authors:** Luigi Carvalho Ferreira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13501v1)

**Summary:**

We consider four-dimensional Euclidean Yang-Mills theories quantized in the maximal Abelian and linear covariant gauges at finite temperature. Non-perturbatively, the Faddeev-Popov procedure must be improved to take into account the existence of the so-called Gribov copies. We focus in a hybrid approach where the thermal masses are derived through perturbative propagators as a stepping stone for a self-consistent treatment. We verify three different phases for the gluonic degrees of freedom; one of complete confinement at low temperatures, an intermediate one of partial confinement, and one ofcomplete deconfinement at high temperatures.

## 18. Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology -- Numerical   analyses on lattice

**Authors:** Tsuneo Suzuki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434v1)

**Summary:**

Self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity condense in the vacuum, color confinement is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. The topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x) Theoretically Qa(A)=3Qt(A) is expected, but a simple lattice definition is fluctuating between -2 and -3.

## 19. Thermodynamic analysis and shadow bound of black holes surrounded by a   dark matter halo

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13397v1)

**Summary:**

We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a black hole (BH) immersed in a dark matter halo (DMH) We use the Newtonian Helmholtz free energy to show that there is no phase transition to other BH with positive heat capacity surrounded by a DMH. We investigate the shadow bound of favored region for the BH immersed in the DMH by introducing three critical impact parameters. The Newtonian ($1/a_0$) approximation gives us a correct thermodynamic description of BH surrounded by DMH because first law of thermodynamics and Smarr formula are satisfied.
