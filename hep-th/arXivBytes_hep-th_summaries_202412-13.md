## 0. The S-matrix bootstrap with neural optimizers I: zero double   discontinuity

**Authors:** Mehmet Asim Gumus, Damien Leflot, Piotr Tourkine, Alexander Zhiboedov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09610v1)

**Summary:**

Neural networks provide an efficient parameterization for scattering amplitudes. They offer a flexible toolkit to describe their fine nonperturbative structure. Combined with the bootstrap approach based on the dispersive representation of the amplitude and machine learning's gradient descent algorithms, they offer a new method to explore the space of consistent S-matrices. The results are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) in a paper titled "Scattering Amplitudes: A Machine Learning Perspective"

**Authors:** Gabriel Malave, Rodrigo Soto-Garrido, Vladimir Juricic, Bitan Roy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09609v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate a field theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting nodal semimetals. dispersion that scales with the linear ($n$th) power of momentum along $d_L$ ($d_M$) mutually orthogonal directions. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a `small' parameter $1/N_f$ We show that emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic corrections to physical observables.

## 2. Bubble dynamics in a QCD-like phase diagram

**Authors:** Yago Bea, Mauro Giliberti, David Mateos, Mikel Sanchez-Garitaonandia, Alexandre Serantes, Miguel Zilhão

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09588v1)

**Summary:**

A line of first-order phase transitions is conjectured in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics at non-zero baryon density. numerical simulations of neutron star mergers suggest that various regions of the stars may cross this line multiple times. This results in the nucleation of bubbles of the preferred phase, which subsequently expand and collide. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is highly sensitive to the velocity of the bubble walls. We use holography to perform the first microscopic simulation of bubble dynamics in a theory that qualitatively mirrors the expected phase diagram.

## 3. A glitch in gravity: cosmic Lorentz-violation from fiery Big Bang to   glacial heat death

**Authors:** Robin Y. Wen, Lukas T. Hergt, Niayesh Afshordi, Douglas Scott

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09568v1)

**Summary:**

One regime where we might see departures from general relativity is at the largest accessible scales. We investigate a single-parameter extension to the standard cosmological model with a different strength of gravity above and below this scale. Cosmic microwave background observations, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (including the recent DESI Y1) favour weaker superhorizon gravity, at nearly a percent (or 2$\sigma$ level) This compounds evidence for an even stronger glitch during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

## 4. Black Mirrors: CPT-Symmetric Alternatives to Black Holes

**Authors:** Kostas Tzanavaris, Latham Boyle, Neil Turok

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09558v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein's equations imply that a gravitationally collapsed object forms an event horizon. But what lies on the other side of this horizon? In this paper, we question the reality of the conventional solution (the black hole) and point out another, topologically distinct solution: the black mirror. In the black hole solution, the horizon connects the exterior metric to an interior metric which contains a curvature singularity. We give the general stationary (charged, rotating) black mirror solution explicitly, and describe the general black mirror formed by gravitational collapse.

## 5. Les Houches lectures on two-dimensional gravity and holography

**Authors:** Gustavo J. Turiaci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09537v1)

**Summary:**

Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.

## 6. AdS amplitudes as CFT correlators

**Authors:** Maximo Bañados, Ernesto Bianchi, Ivan Muñoz, Kostas Skenderis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09503v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09503v1)

**Summary:**

We show that AdS amplitudes are CFT correlators to all orders in the loop expansion by showing that they obey the conformal Ward identities. In particular, we provide explicit formulas for the constants and functions of cross-ratios that determine the CFT correlateators in terms of bulk data. We also show that the AdS amplitudes are CFT receivers to all orders of the loop expansion and that they obey the Ward identities.

## 7. The Fuzzball Paradigm

**Authors:** Samir D. Mathur, Madhur Mehta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09495v1)

**Summary:**

We describe the fuzzball construction of black hole microstates. These states have no horizon and radiate from their surface like a normal body, so there is no information puzzle. We explain how the semiclassical approximation is violated in gravitational collapse even though curvatures are low at the horizon. This violation happens because the collapse leads to a stretching of space that is {\it fast}: light does not have time to travel across the collapsing region. It is plausible that similar effects of fast expansion may be responsible for effects like dark energy.

## 8. Entanglement and Interface Conditions on Fields

**Authors:** Antonina Maj, V. P. Nair

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09491v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the vacuum wave function of a free scalar field theory in space partitioned into two regions. A direct integration over fields in a subregion is carried out to obtain the reduced density matrix. This leads to a constructive proof of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. We also consider a specific conditional probability as another measure of entanglement which is more amenable to analysis of the dependence on interface conditions. Finally, we discuss a direct calculation of correlation functions and how it gives an alternate route to the reduceddensity matrix.

## 9. Gravitational ABJ Anomaly, Stochastic Matter Production, and   Leptogenesis

**Authors:** Azadeh Maleknejad

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09490v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational ABJ anomaly links the chirality of the gravitational field to the chiral fermions, resulting in the stochastic generation of fermionic matter in the radiation era. We show that this mechanism can account for the entire dark matter relic density and discuss its potential as a leptogenesis scenario to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Remarkably, this letter reveals that even if gravitational waves become unpolarized later, their temporaryChirality during their generation process leaves a lasting imprint on the fermion matter.

## 10. Framework for the Forced Soliton Equation: Regularization, Numerical   Solutions, and Perturbation Theory

**Authors:** Zachary J. Allamon, Quentin A. Hales, Andrew B. Royston, Douglas L. Rutledge, Erica A. Yozie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09487v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09487v1)

**Summary:**

The forced soliton equation is the starting point for semiclassical computations with solitons away from the small momentum transfer regime. Numerical solutions at large transfer, greater or similar to the soliton mass, are capable of exhibiting extreme phenomena such as soliton-antisoliton pair creation and superluminal collective coordinate velocities. The paper develops necessary analytical and numerical tools for analyzing solutions to the forced Soliton equation in the context of two-dimensional models with kinks. Results include a finite degree of freedom regularization of soliton sector physics based on periodic and anti-periodic lattice models.

## 11. Entanglement Rényi entropies in celestial holography

**Authors:** Federico Capone, Andy O'Bannon, Ronnie Rodgers, Somyadip Thakur

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09485v1)

**Summary:**

Celestial holography is the conjecture that scattering amplitudes in Minkowski spacetimes are dual to correlators of a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) on the celestial sphere. In a CFT, we can calculate sub-region entanglement R\'{e}nyi entropies (EREs) via the replica trick. We argue that CCFT twist operators are holographically dual to cosmic branes in the $(d+2)$- dimensional spacetime. We find that this universal contribution vanishes when $d=4$ mod $4$.

## 12. Counting and building operators in theories with hidden symmetries and   application to HEFT

**Authors:** Rodrigo Alonso, Shakeel Ur Rahaman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09463v1)

**Summary:**

Identifying a full basis of operators to a given order is key to the generality of Effective Field Theory (EFT) This is by now a problem of known solution in terms of the Hilbert series. The present work is concerned with hidden symmetry in general and Higgs EFT in particular and connects the counting formula presented in [1] in the CCWZ formulation with the linear frame. It outlines the differences in perturbation theory in each frame and presents a new counting formula with measure for HEFT.

## 13. Temperature-Resistant Order in 2+1 Dimensions

**Authors:** Zohar Komargodski, Fedor K. Popov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09459v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09459v1)

**Summary:**

High temperatures are typically thought to increase disorder. Here we examine this idea in Quantum Field Theory in 2+1 dimensions. We identify UV-complete, local, unitary models in this class and show that symmetry breaking occurs at any temperature in some regions of the phase diagram. This phenomenon, previously observed in models with fractional dimensions, or in the strict planar limits, or with non-local interactions, is now exhibited in a unitary 2-1 dimensional model with a finite number of fields.

## 14. de Sitter Excited State in Heterotic E_8 x E_8 Theory

**Authors:** Suddhasattwa Brahma, Keshav Dasgupta, Bohdan Kulinich, Archana Maji, P. Ramadevi, Radu Tatar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09449v1)

**Summary:**

We devise a novel duality sequence to study late-time cosmology. We find that the dimensionally reduced four-dimensional theory does not violate NEC. We do not see either a bouncing or an ekpyrotic phase. Instead, our setup shows a transient de Sitter phase that lies well within the trans-Planckian bound. This opens up a myriad of possibilities of addressing both phenomenological and cosmological issues. We concentrate on one such interesting model, an axionic cosmology with temporally varying axionic coupling.

## 15. Backreaction inclusive Schwinger effect

**Authors:** Shagun Kaushal, Suprit Singh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09436v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09436v1)

**Summary:**

We employ a self-consistent framework to study the backreaction effects of particle creation in coupled semiclassical dynamics of a quantum complex scalar field and a classical electric field. We study the time-dependent particle content, current density, and electric field, and describe how they capture the time evolution of the quantized field modes. We then compare the results with and without backre reaction in flat and cosmological de Sitter spacetime, finding that the Backreaction significantly alters particle production in both cases.

## 16. Regge symmetry of 6j-symbols of the Lorentz group

**Authors:** Elena Apresyan, Gor Sarkissian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09425v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we derive new symmetry and new expression for $6j$-symbols of the unitary principle series representations of the $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ group. This allowed us to derive for them the analogue of the Regge symmetry. We also show how to use this new symmetry to derive a new form of the Riemann zig-zag symmetry.

## 17. Gauge-invariant scalar and vector operators in the   $SU\left(2\right)\times U\left(1\right)$ Higgs model: Ward identities and   renormalization

**Authors:** Giovani Peruzzo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09406v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate the renormalization of the gauge-invariant composite operators proposed in \cite{Dudal:2023jsu} to describe the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ Higgs model. To establish the relationship between the counterterms, we use the Algebraic Renormalization approach. We also derive the set of Ward identities of the model after introducing these composite operators. Using these Ward identities, we demonstrate important exact relations between the correlation functions of elementary fields and composite fields.

## 18. Quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in shift-symmetric   Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory

**Authors:** Fech Scen Khoo, Jose Luis Blázquez-Salcedo, Burkhard Kleihaus, Jutta Kunz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09377v1)

**Summary:**

Quasinormal modes were recently obtained by employing perturbation theory in quadratic order in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Here we present the full non-perturbative results for the spectrum within the domain of existence of rotating black holes. We also compare with the quasinormal mode spectrum of rapidly rotating Einstein-dilaton-Gauss- Bonnet black holes and compare them with the perturbative result. We employ a recently developed spectral method to obtain the spectrum.

## 19. Propagating degrees of freedom on maximally-symmetric backgrounds in   $f(R)$ theories of gravity

**Authors:** Adrián Casado-Turrión, Álvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz, Antonio Dobado

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09366v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of $f(R)$ gravity, as well as other extended theories of gravity, the correct counting of globally well-defined dynamical modes has recently drawn a vivid interest. In this communication we present a consistent approach shedding light on such issues for both so-called degenerate and non-degenerate models. We find that the linearised spectrum of degenerate models on these backgrounds is empty, lacking both the graviton and scalaron modes which appear in generic non- Degenerated models.

## 20. Testing the RG-flow $M(3,10)+φ_{1,7}\to M(3,8)$ with Hamiltonian   Truncation

**Authors:** Olivier Delouche, Joan Elias Miro, James Ingoldby

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09295v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M (3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. We carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory.

## 21. DeWitt wave functions for de Sitter JT gravity

**Authors:** Wilfried Buchmuller, Arthur Hebecker, Alexander Westphal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09211v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09211v1)

**Summary:**

Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an intriguing model for cosmological wave functions of the universe. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Projection to expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.

## 22. An overview of Bagger-Witten line bundles

**Authors:** E. Sharpe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09198v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09198v1)

**Summary:**

Bagger-Witten line bundles are bundles over moduli spaces of two-dimensional N=2 SCFTs. Their existence is a consequence of the global U(1)_R symmetry of the theories. Our overview includes a discussion of applications in supergravities coupled to gauge theories. We also propose a proposal for a purely geometric interpretation of the bundles.

## 23. Symplectic Quantization and Minkowskian Statistical Mechanics:   simulations on a 1+1 lattice

**Authors:** Martina Giachello, Giacomo Gradenigo, Francesco Scardino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09162v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce symplectic quantization, a novel functional approach to quantum field theory. It allows to sample quantum fields fluctuations directly in Minkowski space-time. This is at variance with the traditional importance sampling protocols, well defined only for Euclidean Field Theory. We show that the microcanonical correlation functions are equivalent to those generated by a Minkowskian canonical theory, with $S$ being the original relativistic action of the system. In this framework, expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the trajectories parameterized by $tau$.

## 24. Betwixt Annihilation and Decay: The Hidden Structure of Cosmological   Stasis

**Authors:** Jonah Barber, Keith R. Dienes, Brooks Thomas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09123v1)

**Summary:**

Stasis is a unique cosmological phenomenon in which the abundances of different energy components in the universe remain fixed. To date, stasis has been found within a number of very different BSM cosmologies. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the energy flows in all of these theories during stasis. We find that these theories all share a common energy-flow structure which in some sense lies between particle decay and particle annihilation. This structure has been hidden until now but ultimately lies at the root of the stasis phenomenon.

## 25. Highest weight vectors, shifted topological recursion and quantum curves

**Authors:** Raphaël Belliard, Vincent Bouchard, Reinier Kramer, Tanner Nelson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120v1)

**Summary:**

We extend the theory of topological recursion by considering Airy structures whose partition functions are highest weight vectors of particular $\mathcal{W}$-algebra representations. We show that this generalization amounts to adding specific terms to the correlators of the spectral curve. We then prove that the wave-functions constructed from this shifted version of topology recursion are WKB solutions of families of quantizations of the spectrum. In the reverse direction, starting from an $hbar$-connection, we find that a structure is topological if the exact same conditions that we found for the Airy structure are satisfied.

## 26. Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3)   lattice gauge theory

**Authors:** Daniel Spitz, Julian M. Urban, Jan M. Pawlowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09112v1)

**Summary:**

Topological data analysis can discriminate phase transitions of different order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. It provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps ofElectric and magnetic energy density around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curve.

## 27. NNLL Transverse Momentum Dependent evolution in the Parton Branching   method

**Authors:** Aleksandra Lelek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09108v1)

**Summary:**

The understanding of the 3D structure of hadron is becoming increasingly urgent. This triggers the activities to include elements of Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization physics in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. The method designed especially to address this need is the TMD Parton Branching (PB) method. The equivalence of the PB Sudakov form factor, both perturbative and non-perturbative, to the one of Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) is demonstrated.

## 28. Mass spectrum in AdS$_4\times U(1)\setminus U(3)/U(1) $ compactification   using harmonic analysis

**Authors:** Moumita Patra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08962v1)

**Summary:**

The Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum of 0-form and 1-form fields that appear in AdS$_4\times B_7$ compactification of $d=11$ supergravity. This theory belongs to the class of gravity duals to three dimensional quiver Chern-Simons matter theories as demonstrated by D.L Jafferis and A. Tomasiello in \cite{jaff} In this paper we present the Kaluzei mass spectrum.

## 29. Grassmann Tensor Renormalization Group for $N_f=2$ massive Schwinger   model with a $θ$ term

**Authors:** Hayato Kanno, Shinichiro Akiyama, Kotaro Murakami, Shinji Takeda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08959v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08959v1)

**Summary:**

We use the Grassmann tensor renormalization group method to investigate the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\pi$ periodic $theta$ term. Our calculation provides consistent results with not only the analytical solution in the large mass limit but also the previous Monte Carlo studies in the small mass regime. Our numerical results also suggest that the model on a lattice has a different phase structure, than the model in the continuum limit.

## 30. Probing Spacetime Symmetries Using Gravitational Wave Ringdown

**Authors:** Rajes Ghosh, Akash K Mishra, Sudipta Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08942v1)

**Summary:**

The uniqueness and rigidity theorems assert that the asymptotically flat, vacuum, stationary rotating black hole solution in general relativity must be the Kerr solution. In our analysis of post-merger ringdown signal from coalescing black hole binary systems, we identify potential observational signatures for deviations from these Kerr symmetries. Utilizing ringdown data from the gravitational wave event GW150914, we place significant constraints on such deviations. Our analysis introduces a new and novel approach for testing spacetime symmetry through gravitational wave observations.

## 31. Rational RG flow, extension, and Witt class

**Authors:** Ken Kikuchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08935v1)

**Summary:**

The conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets. The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.

## 32. High Quality QCD Axion via Electric-Magnetic Duality

**Authors:** Shota Nakagawa, Yuichiro Nakai, Junxuan Xu, Yufei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08931v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08931v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel paradigm for the QCD axion with high-quality Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry on the basis of electric-magnetic duality in the conformal window of a supersymmetric gauge theory. The model naturally accommodates a mechanism to suppress the axion isocurvature fluctuation, it provides a complete solution to the strong CP problem as well as the identity of DM. In the other viable parameter space, the lightest supers asymmetric particle can become a DM candidate.

## 33. The generalized CV conjecture of Krylov complexity

**Authors:** Ke-Hong Zhai, Lei-Hua Liu, Hai-Qing Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08925v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08925v1)

**Summary:**

We conjecture that Krylov complexity equals the volume of the Fubini-Study metric in the information geometry. In order to test our conjecture, we study the general Hermitian two-mode Hamiltonian according to the Weyl algebra both in the closed and open systems. Remarkably, in both cases, the resulting volume provides strong evidence for the validity of the generalized CV conjecture. We find that the wave function for a closed system corresponds to the well-known two- Mode squeezed state. For an open system, we can create a wave function known as the open two- mode squeezed state by using the second kind of Meixner polynomials.

## 34. Chiral phase transition: effective field theory and holography

**Authors:** Yanyan Bu, Zexin Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08882v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08882v1)

**Summary:**

We consider chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but vanishing baryon density. We apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low energy effective field theory (EFT) for the system. Dynamical variables involve chiral charge densities and order parameter. The EFT action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model using the holographic Schwinger/Keldy technique. With suitable higher terms neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the EFT resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification.

## 35. Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole

**Authors:** Parthapratim Pradhan, John W. Moffat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08844v1)

**Summary:**

It has been argued that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine the Kerr-MOG black hole and derive its form through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the black hole within the framework of modified gravity. The study also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches..

## 36. Non-minimally coupled quintessential inflation

**Authors:** Seong Chan Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08833v1)

**Summary:**

We present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses the dynamics of early-time cosmic inflation and late- time cosmic acceleration. By employing an exponential coupling function and a scalar potential with dual asymptotic plateaus, our model naturally transitions from inflationary dynamics at small field values to a quintessence-like behavior at large field values. For late-time acceleration, the model produces a viable dark energy component with an equation of state $w_\phi$ approaching $-1$ but retaining a measurable deviation that could serve as an observational signature.
