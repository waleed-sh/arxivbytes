## 0. Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and   time-varying tension

**Authors:** Anish Ghoshal, Filippo Revello, Gonzalo Villa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20994v1)

**Summary:**

The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current experimental reach. The tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. We show that part of the spectrum generically lies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a characteristic drop in the amplitude. The corresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and reheating.

## 1. There is no boundary problem

**Authors:** J. François, L. Ravera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20945v1)

**Summary:**

In General Relativity and gauge field theory, one often encounters a claim, which may be called the boundary problem, according to which "boundaries break diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries" We argue that this statement has the same conceptual structure as the hole argument, and is thus likewise defused by the point-coincidence argument. We show that the boundaryproblem dissolves once it is understood that a physical region, thus its boundary, is relationally and invariantly defined.

## 2. Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions

**Authors:** Rudnei O. Ramos, Gabriel S. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943v1)

**Summary:**

The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. We revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI. The model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, but its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics.

## 3. Elliptic leading singularities and canonical integrands

**Authors:** Ekta Chaubey, Vasily Sotnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20897v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20897v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a generalization of the case covering integration of differential forms on elliptic curves. We first construct a special algebraic basis of integrands, including a differential one-form of the second kind, and match it to a Feynman integral ansatz in a suitable parametrization. Integration over a preferred basis cycle reveals their (elliptic) leading singularities. A simple transformation that sets all but one of the elliptic leading singularity to zero and normalizes the remaining one to unity then defines the canonical integranded.

## 4. Chaos Around the Kerr Black Hole: its Effects on Entropy and the Shadow

**Authors:** Aydin Tavlayan, Bayram Tekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876v1)

**Summary:**

Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit chaotic motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. In both of these cases, chaotic motion causes information production. This information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black Hole mass and spin. We show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics.

## 5. BV actions for extended geometry

**Authors:** Martin Cederwall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20873v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20873v1)

**Summary:**

I review the construction of actions for extended geometry from the grading of an underlying tensor hierarchy algebra. The dynamics is neatly encoded in a complex. This talk, presented at the Corfu Summer Institute 2024, is mainly based on joint work with J. Palmkvist, in particular ref. [1]. It is based on a paper published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics, published by the University of Helsinki, Finland, in 2010. The paper was published on behalf of the Finnish Academy of Sciences and Letters.

## 6. ($0,6$) AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and surface defects

**Authors:** Yolanda Lozano, Anayeli Ramirez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20864v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20864v1)

**Summary:**

We explore a new class of AdS$_3$ solutions in massive type IIA supergravity. The brane box configuration suggests an interpretation of the solutions as dual to surface defects within the ABJ(M) theory. Remarkably, no explicit field theories are currently known to realise $\mathcal{N} = (0,6)$ supersymmetry in two dimensions, making our setup a promising and largely unexplored direction for field-theoretic investigations. Our findings provide a concrete setting for exploring holography beyond the ABJM vacuum.

## 7. Conformal Einstein equation and symplectic flux with a positive   cosmological constant

**Authors:** SK Jahanur Hoque, Pavel Krtous, Carlos Peón-Nieto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20845v1)

**Summary:**

Fall-off conditions are consistent with a finite, non-trivial presymplectic current on the future boundary of de Sitter. We present an explicit gauge-free computation to show that the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term, counterterm in the action, and fall-off condition of gravitational field in conformal Einstein equation are crucial to reproduce the finite symplectic flux. Our result allows a non-zero gravitational flux across the boundary of the de Sitters, we say.

## 8. Effective Metric Description of Charged Black Holes

**Authors:** Mattia Damia Paciarini, Manuel Del Piano, Stefan Hohenegger, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20810v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20810v1)

**Summary:**

Charged black holes arise as solutions of General Relativity (GR) coupled to Maxwell theory. As functions of the mass and charge, they can exhibit extremal behavior, in which case they are stable against thermal decay. (Quantum) corrections to GR are expected to alter the classical features of these objects, especially near extremality. To capture such effects in a model-independent way, we extend the Effective Metric Description (EMD) for spherically symmetric and static black holes. The EMD parametrizes deformations of the metric in terms of physical quantities, such as the spatial distance to the event horizon.

## 9. On three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry: maximally   supersymmetric backgrounds and massive deformations

**Authors:** Sergei M. Kuzenko, Emmanouil S. N. Raptakis, Igor B. Samsonov, Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20712v1)

**Summary:**

Using the $SO ({\cal N})$ superspace formulation, we derive all maximally supersymmetric backgrounds in the ${\cal N} =4$ case. We also demonstrate the generation of topologically massive supersymmetry gauge theories from radiative corrections in the hypermultiplet sector. Theories necessarily contain Chern-Simons terms at the component level. They originate as massive deformations of the following two families of theories in standard Minkowski superspace: (i) superconformal field theories; and (ii) supers asymmetric gauge theories.

## 10. Static black hole horizons in cosmology

**Authors:** Ida M. Rasulian, Amjad Ashoorioon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701v1)

**Summary:**

We present a black hole metric that has a static horizon whilst mimicking the cosmological behavior at large scales away from the black hole horizon. This metric does not suffer from issues like a singular horizon for asymptotically vanishing Hubble parameter. The resulting metric is consistent with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric for constant Hubble parameters. It should be noted that this metric doesnot lead to isotropic pressure, i.e. $p_\perp\neq p_r$ for radial distances.

## 11. From the Fokker-Planck equation to perturbative QFT's results in de   Sitter space

**Authors:** Alexander Kamenshchik, Polina Petriakova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20646v1)

**Summary:**

A technique to build perturbative series for the spectator field's correlation functions in de Sitter space is proposed. We derive from the first-order differential equation the iterative integral relation for equal- and multi-time correlation functions. With an appropriate integration, the obtained two-point and four-point correlation functions are in agreement with quantum field theory's ones in the leading-logarithm approximation. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics.

## 12. Dressed fields for Quantum Chromodynamics

**Authors:** Iustus C. Hemprich, Karl-Henning Rehren

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20641v1)

**Summary:**

String-localized QFT allows to explain Standard Model interactions in an autonomous way, committed to quantum principles rather than a "gauge principle" The main tool are "dressed fields", that are intermediate between free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit formulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as non-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility, enabled by our approach, that traces of confinement may be visible already at the level of the dressed fields.

## 13. Horizon Thermodynamics on Nice Slices of the Causal Diamond

**Authors:** Ian Nagle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20621v1)

**Summary:**

Gravity can be derived from entanglement entropy in conformal field theories. However, this depends crucially on properties of horizons, and asymptotic symmetries of phase space. To explore how this relation behaves under dynamical processes, we consider covariant gravitational phase space enhanced with bulk conformal symmetry. We find a new vector contribution to the Abbott-Deser-Tekin charges that arises for conformal symmetry. In applying this to the causal diamond, we derive a general relation for surface gravity.

## 14. Criticality of charged AdS black holes with string clouds in boundary   conformal field theory

**Authors:** Aditya Singh, Sandip Mahish

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20486v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20486v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of this letter is to study the universal thermodynamics and criticality of charged AdS black holes with string clouds. For this system, we determined the critical quantities and noticed that the free energy in the bulk exhibits swallow tail behavior. In the boundary CFT, the presence of second order phase transition is observed. At constant charge, the heat capacity is finite in the Bulk but diverges at critical points in the CFT. We tried to determine the nature of interactions between black hole molecules.

## 15. Beyond Robertson-Schrödinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling   Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs

**Authors:** Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Hiromichi Ohno, Jaeha Lee, Dariusz Chruściński

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404v1)

**Summary:**

We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024) We report a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed.

## 16. Hydrostatic equilibrium in multi-Weyl semimetals

**Authors:** Jewel Kumar Ghosh, Francisco Peña-Benítez, Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20361v1)

**Summary:**

We study the hydrostatic equilibrium of multi-Weyl semimetals. They are systems with Weyl-like quasi-particles but anisotropic dispersion relation. We propose a covariant formulation for the low energy theory, allowing for a minimal coupling of the fermion field to external geometric background and $U(1)$ gauge field. The non-Lorentzian structure of the field theory demands introducing an Aristotelian spacetime analogous to the so-called stringy Newton-Cartan geometry.

## 17. T-duality, Loop Hori Formulae and the Twisted Bismut-Chern Character

**Authors:** Fei Han, Varghese Mathai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20358v1)

**Summary:**

The main purpose of this paper is to establish the loop space formulation of T-duality in the presence of background flux. In particular, we construct a loop space analogue of the Hori formula, termed the loop Hori map. We demonstrate that it induces a quasi-isomorphism between the exotic twisted equivariant cohomologies on the free loop spaces of the T- Dual sides. This significantly refines the earlier work of the authors in 2015 where T-Duality was established after localisation to the base space.
