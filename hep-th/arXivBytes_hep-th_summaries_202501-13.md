## 0. Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems

**Authors:** Takato Yoshimura, Lucas SÃ¡

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183v1)

**Summary:**

In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In contrast, the quantum theory of many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. We relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and argue that all quantum RP resonate converge inside theunit disk. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation.

## 1. Algebraic solutions for $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems:   generic statistical ensembles and a mesoscopic system application

**Authors:** Alex E. Bernardini, Roldao da Rocha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06182v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06182v1)

**Summary:**

Solutions of generic $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems are obtained through systematic manipulations of quartic polynomial equations. An ansatz for constructing separable and entangled eigenstate basis, depending on the quartic equation coefficients, is proposed. Besides the quantum concurrence for pure entangled states, the associated thermodynamic statistical ensembles, their partition function and quantum purity are shown to be straightforwardly obtained. Results are specialized to a $SU (2)otimes (SU( 2)$ structure emulated by lattice-layer degrees of freedom of the Bernal stacked graphene.

## 2. Black holes from chaos

**Authors:** Matthew Dodelson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06170v1)

**Summary:**

We study the emergence of black hole geometry from chaotic systems at finite temperature. The essential input is the universal operator growth hypothesis. Under this assumption, we map the chaotic dynamics to a discrete analog of the scattering problem on a black hole background. We give a simple prescription for computing the Green's functions, and explore some of the resulting analytic properties. In particular, we present evidence that the spectral density is a meromorphic function of frequency with no zeroes, and we work out several instructive examples.

## 3. Scattering with depletion in strong, focussed fields

**Authors:** Tim Adamo, Anton Ilderton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06109v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06109v1)

**Summary:**

Theoretical approaches to QED scattering in strong fields typically treat the field as a fixed background with simple spacetime dependence, such as a plane wave. Two major challenges are therefore the inclusion of effects due to backreaction (depletion of the field) and spatial geometry (e.g. focussing) We show that a solution to one problem can solve the other: even if particle wavefunctions in a chosen focussed background are not known, we show that they can be constructed once depletion is accounted for.

## 4. The Spectre of Underdetermination in Modern Cosmology

**Authors:** Pedro G. Ferreira, William J. Wolf, James Read

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06095v1)

**Summary:**

The scientific status of physical cosmology has been the subject of philosophical debate ever since Einstein's general theory of relativity. This article revisits, in light of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier debate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow. We argue that modern cosmology faces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the microphysical nature of its exotic energy components. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects for future breakthroughs and/or non-empirical arguments which could decide this issue conclusively.

## 5. The Role of Type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann Algebras and their Tensor   Structure in Quantum Gravity}}

**Authors:** Manfred Requardt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06009v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that the type classification of v.Neumann algebras play an important role in a theory of quantum gravity and quantum space-time physics. We provide arguments that type $II_1$ and its representation as a tensor product of an ordinary (exterior) Hilbert space algebra do represent the first step away from the semiclassical picture towards a full theory ofQuantum gravity. We also argue that type. $II_{\infty}$ is encoding, in our view, the hidden microscopic gravitational degrees of freedom.
