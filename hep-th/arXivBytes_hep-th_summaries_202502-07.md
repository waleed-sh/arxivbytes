## 0. Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin Transformations in Quantum Electrodynamics:   For Perturbation Theory and Dynamical Mass Generation

**Authors:** Anam Ashraf, M. Jamil Aslam, Faisal Akram, Adnan Bashir

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04254v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04254v1)

**Summary:**

We carry out a comprehensive analysis of the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations for a charged fermion propagator at the two-loop level in quantum electrodynamics. We provide explicit expressions in three and four-dimensional QED. We also study constraints of multiplicative renormalizabilty of our results in four- dimensional QED which are logarithmically divergent. Finally, we analyze representative solutions of the fermional propagator which correspond to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation.

## 1. Black Hole Evaporation in Loop Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** Abhay Ashtekar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252v1)

**Summary:**

The conference marked the 50th anniversary of Hawking's seminal paper on black hole radiance. It was clear already from Hawking's analysis that a proper quantum gravity theory would be essential for a more complete understanding of the evaporation process. This task was undertaken in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) two decades ago and by now the literature on the subject is quite rich. The goal of this contribution is to summarize a mainstream perspective that has emerged. The intended audience is the broader gravitational physics community, rather than quantum gravity experts.

## 2. Microcausality without Lorentz invariance

**Authors:** Lam Hui, Alberto Nicolis, Alessandro Podo, Shengjia Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04215v1)

**Summary:**

Microcausality -- the vanishing of commutators outside the lightcone -- is a fundamental property of relativistic quantum field theories. We derive its implications for two-point functions of scalar operators on Lorentz-breaking states. In the cosmological case, we derive a positivity condition on an EFT coefficient in an inflationary background. Lastly, we comment on how microcausability can be used to constrain higher-point correlation functions, via suitable nested commutator.

## 3. Absence of CP Violation in the Strong Interaction: Vacuum thwarts Axion

**Authors:** Gerrit Schierholz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04092v1)

**Summary:**

QCD admits a contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which potentially gives rise to nontrivial phases and violates CP. In this talk I will address the problem using new developments on the lattice. The overall solution is contrasted with the axion `solution' to the problem of how the vacuum reacts to the term. The talk will be presented in two parts: the first on QCD and the second on axion. For more information on the QCD talk click here.

## 4. $\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of   massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes

**Authors:** Marco Calzá

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce and describe a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray- body factors for massless fields with spin. It is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.

## 5. Holographic confining theories on space-times with constant positive   curvature

**Authors:** Jani Kastikainen, Elias Kiritsis, Francesco Nitti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04036v1)

**Summary:**

 quantum phase transitions are investigated in holographic confining QFTs defined on a fixed constant positive curvature background. We find a competition between two branches of solutions and a phase transition as one varies the space-time curvature. We argue that, depending on the leading asymptotic exponent of the scalar potential, the transition may be first-order or higher-order. The low-curvature phase has the same kind of IR geometry as the flat-space solution, while the high-curved phase has a regular interior.

## 6. Equivalence principles in Weyl transverse gravity

**Authors:** Ana Alonso-Serrano, Luis J. Garay, Marek Liška

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03888v1)

**Summary:**

There exist two consistent theories of massless, self-interacting gravitons. They differ by their local symmetries: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. We show that these two theories are also the only two metric descriptions of gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions which obey the equivalence principle for test gravitational physics. We further analyse how the weaker formulations of the equivalences principle are realised in Weyltransverse gravity (and its generalisations) The analysis sheds light on the behaviour of matter fields in this theory.

## 7. First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $θ= π$   under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description

**Authors:** Yuanyuan Wang. Shinya Matsuzaki, Mamiya Kawaguchi, Akio Tomiya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagneticscale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form. We find that the thermalCP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. We work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$

## 8. A microscopic model of de Sitter spacetime with an observer

**Authors:** Damiano Tietto, Herman Verlinde

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03869v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a simple microscopic quantum mechanical model of low-dimensional de Sitter holography with an observer. Using semiclassical gravity and elementary thermodynamic considerations, we derive a formula for the total entropy of a 3D Schwarzschild-de Sitter universe. We then match this entropy formula with the exactly known spectral density of the double scaled SYK model. Our result gives a deSitter interpretation of the appearance of two notions of temperature in DSSYK. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 9. Quantum integrable model for the quantum cohomology/quantum K-theory of   flag varieties and the double $β$-Grothendieck polynomials

**Authors:** Jirui Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03768v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03768v1)

**Summary:**

A GL$(n)$ quantum integrable system generalizing the asymmetric five vertices spin chain is shown to encode the ring relations of the equivariant quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory ring of flag varieties. We also show that the Bethe ansatz states of this system generate the double $\beta$-Grothendieck polynomials. We conclude that the system can be used to prove the theory of quantum entanglement in terms of a quantum ring.

## 10. Novel echoes from black holes in conformal Weyl gravity

**Authors:** Mehrab Momennia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03706v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03706v1)

**Summary:**

We reveal a novel class of echoes from black holes in conformal Weyl gravity. They are generated due to the large-scale structure of the cosmos, rather than near-horizon modifications of black holes as well as wormhole spacetimes. We perform the calculations for the time evolution profiles of scalar perturbations to understand how the linear term in the metric function and the cosmological constant produce echoes. The Prony method is also employed to calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the early-stage quasin formal ringing phase.
