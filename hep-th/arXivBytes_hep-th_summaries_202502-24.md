## 0. Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries

**Authors:** Yi-Jun He, Jue Hou, Yi-Chao Liu, Zi-Xi Tan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636v1)

**Summary:**

In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetry and boundary conditions.

## 1. Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from   supersymmetric gauge theory

**Authors:** Xian-Hui Ge, Masataka Matsumoto, Kilar Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627v1)

**Summary:**

The master equation of the Proca field in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by using the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal modes duality. We establish the dictionary between the parameters in gauge and gravity theories, since both sides lead to Heun-type equations. Applying the technique of instanton counting, we analytically find the eigenfrequencies of the quasinormal mode and quasi-bound states for massive vector fields around black holes. The results show consistency with known numerical researches in the literature.

## 2. Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System

**Authors:** Dimitrios Karamitros, Thomas McKelvey, Apostolos Pilaftsis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625v1)

**Summary:**

We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs) CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system. We define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ.

## 3. Equivariant localization in supergravity in odd dimensions

**Authors:** Edoardo Colombo, Vasil Dimitrov, Dario Martelli, Alberto Zaffaroni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15624v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss a localization formula for certain integrals on odd-dimensional manifolds with boundaries equipped with a Killing vector. We employ this to localize the regularised on-shell action of a large class of supersymmetric solutions of five dimensional minimal gauged supergravity. We find that the background subtraction regularization method leads to an intriguing formula for the on- shell action. As our main example we provide a derivation of the well-known entropy function of supers asymmetric and rotating black holes in AdS_5.

## 4. Generalized determinant inspired by QCD

**Authors:** Francesco Giacosa, Michał Zakrzewski, Shahriyar Jafarzade, Robert D. Pisarski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617v1)

**Summary:**

We present a generalized determinant as a function of $N$ distinct $N \times N$ complex matrices into a complex number. This function, originally introduced in the study of the chiral anomaly in QCD, reduces to the usual determinant when all the matrices are taken as equal. We denote it as `polydeterminant' Here, we explore its main algebraic properties as well as its geometric interpretation in detail. In particular, we focus on connections to mesons.

## 5. On the phenomenological implications of a Pati-Salam model spontaneously   broken by Higgs fields in fundamental representations

**Authors:** George K. Leontaris, Ruiwen Ouyang, Ye-ling Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15614v1)

**Summary:**

We present a supersymmetric Pati-Salam model with small representations as a potential candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model. The model features a Higgs sector with bifundamental fields $H_R+\bar H_R=(4,1,2)+(\bar 4,2,1)$ and $h_a+\ bar H_L=4,2,.1. The matter spectrum is augmented with three copies of neutral singlets that mix with ordinary neutrinos to realize the seesaw mechanism.

## 6. Status of early dark energy after DESI: the role of $Ω_m$ and $r_s   H_0$

**Authors:** Jun-Qian Jiang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541v1)

**Summary:**

The EDE model is one of the promising solutions to the long-standing Hubble tension. This paper investigates the status of several EDE models in light of recent BAO observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) The DESI Y1 BAO results deviate from the CMB and Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) observations in their constraints on the matter density and the Hubble constant $r_s H_0$. Meanwhile, these Ede models happen to tend towards this deviation.

## 7. Implications of Photon Mass: Vortextrap Magnetization of Black Holes

**Authors:** Gia Dvali, Zaza N. Osmanov, Michael Zantedeschi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15510v1)

**Summary:**

Vortextrap magnetization (VTM) can generate a near-saturated magnetic field in astrophysical black holes. The extreme magnetic field is provided by a large number of Nielsen-Olesen type vortex lines piercing a black hole. The VTM mechanism neatly fits supermassive black holes with sizes matching the phenomenologically-acceptable values of the photon mass. It has implications for magnetic-field based particle acceleration. Even in absence of surrounding plasma, the VTM field is expected to result into an intense electromagnetic radiation as well as gravitational waves.

## 8. Foundational aspects of spinor structures and exotic spinors

**Authors:** J. M. Hoff da Silva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15471v1)

**Summary:**

Spacetimes may have more than one spinor structure, depending on topological properties. The spinors resulting from the extra structures are called exotic. In the sequel, we delve into the topologically corrected Dirac operator, explicitly obtaining it and exploring the physical consequences encoded in the exotic spinor dynamics. Finally, we overview early and recent achievements in the area, pointing out possible directions within this research program. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.

## 9. Mesons in a quantum Ising ladder

**Authors:** Yunjing Gao, Yunfeng Jiang, Jianda Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15463v1)

**Summary:**

When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems, the authors say. They also calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor.

## 10. Black hole solutions in the revised Deser-Woodard nonlocal theory of   gravity

**Authors:** Rocco D'Agostino, Vittorio De Falco

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460v1)

**Summary:**

We reformulate the Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity by reformulating the related field equations within a suitable tetrad frame. We then focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum. We demonstrate that the gravitational theory under study admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse power-law correction to the Schwarzschild metric function. This work provides new insights into compact object configurations and advances our understanding of non local gravity theories in the strong-field regime at astrophysical scales.

## 11. Bounds on variations of the strange quark mass from Big Bang   nucleosynthesis

**Authors:** Ulf-G. Meißner, Bernard Metsch, Helen Meyer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15409v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the effect of a variation of the strange nucleon matrix element on the abundances of the light elements produced in the Big Bang. For that, we vary the nucleon mass in the leading eight reactions that involve neutrons, protons and the four lightest nuclei. We use various available Big Bang nucleosynthesis codes and find that the measured deuterium and $^4$He abundances set strict limits on theucleon mass variations. This translates into an upper bound of possible variations of theStrange quark mass, $M_s/m_s \leq 5.1\%$.

## 12. Topological observables and $θ$ dependence in high temperature QCD   from lattice simulations

**Authors:** A. Yu. Kotov, M. P. Lombardo, A. Trunin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15407v1)

**Summary:**

We study topology in Quantum Chromodynamics at high temperatures by means of lattice calculations. Simulations are performed with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist with physical quark masses. We find a rapid crossover to the Dilute Instanton Gas behaviour above $ T \simeq 300$ MeV for all the observables we have considered. We also study the topological charge distribution, the next order cumulant $b_2$ and for the first time, the Free Energy as a function of the $\theta$ angle.

## 13. Quantum black holes: supersymmetry and exact results

**Authors:** Davide Cassani, Sameer Murthy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15360v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15360v1)

**Summary:**

The explanation of black hole entropy as statistical entropy is one of the big successes of string theory. Supersymmetry plays a key role in these developments and leads to prototype systems where we can discuss quantum effects to great precision. We discuss the saddle-points of the gravitational index, and how they reproduce the black hole action and entropy that agree with the index of the holographic superconformal field theory even beyond the leading order in the semiclassical approximation. Throughout, we try to highlight the central role played by the methods as well as foundational concepts of supergravity in driving these developments.

## 14. Feynman integrals, elliptic integrals and two-parameter K3 surfaces

**Authors:** Claude Duhr, Sara Maggio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15326v1)

**Summary:**

The three-loop banana integral with three equal masses and the conformal two-loop five-point traintrack integral in two dimensions are related to a two-parameter family of K3 surfaces. We compute the corresponding periods and the mirror map, and we show that they can be expressed in terms of ordinary modular forms and functions. Our computation reveals a hidden symmetry of the banana integral not manifest from the Feynman integral representation, which corresponds to exchanging the two copies of the sunrise elliptic curve.

## 15. Modular forms for three-loop banana integrals

**Authors:** Claude Duhr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15325v1)

**Summary:**

We study periods of multi-parameter families of K3 surfaces. We focus on their automorphic properties, and we show that generically the periods define orthogonal modular forms. We apply our results to maximal cuts of three-loop banana integrals. We show that depending on the mass configuration, the maximal cuts define ordinary modular forms or Hilbert, Siegel or hermitian modular forms, depending on mass configuration. We conclude that periods can be expressed in terms of other classes of modular forms that have been studied in the mathematics literature.

## 16. Primordial Black Holes

**Authors:** Bernard Carr, Florian Kuhnel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15279v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15279v1)

**Summary:**

In this chapter we first describe the early history of primordial black hole (PBH) research. We then discuss their possible formation mechanisms, including critical collapse from inflationary fluctuations and various types of phase transition. We next describe the numerous constraints on the number density of PBHs from various quantum and astrophysical processes. We end by discussing this evidence, with particular emphasis on their role as dark matter candidates, sources of gravitational waves and seeds for supermassive black holes and early cosmic structures.

## 17. The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$   and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves

**Authors:** Shin'ichi Nojiri, Sergei D. Odintsov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272v1)

**Summary:**

This talk is based on the collaboration with Sergei D. Odintsov. We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T) and $F (Q)$.

## 18. From BPS Spectra of Argyres-Douglas Theories to Families of 3d TFTs

**Authors:** Byeonggi Go, Qiang Jia, Heeyeon Kim, Sungjoon Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15133v1)

**Summary:**

Vertex operator algebras (VOAs) arise in protected subsectors of supersymmetric quantum field theories. They can be best understood from the dynamics of BPS particles in the Coulomb branch of the 4d SCFT. We extract the modular data of the family of boundary VOAs via TFT partition function calculations on Seifert manifolds. Our results suggest that the modulardata obtained from different powers of $hat\Phi$ are related by Galois transformations.

## 19. The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for   the CMB primordial spectra

**Authors:** Sidan A, Tom Banks

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108v1)

**Summary:**

Banks and Zurek use the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. Their conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems. The predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.
