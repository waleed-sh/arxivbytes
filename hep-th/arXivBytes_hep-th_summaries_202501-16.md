## 0. Bosonic String Dinamics

**Authors:** Henrique Legoinha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08952v1)

**Summary:**

String Theory is a hot topic of physics and mathematics. It stands as a direct contribution upstream, going from physics to maths, rather than the usual other way around. These notes provide a comprehensive review of the bosonic string action, the entering point of String Theory. They also cover the resulting equations of motion and the effective mass of open and closed strings.

## 1. Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries III: Noether Realization in Yang-Mills   Theory

**Authors:** Nicolas Cresto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08856v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a non-perturbative action of the higher spin symmetry algebra on the asymptotic Yang-Mills phase space. This Noether charge is naturally conserved in the absence of radiation. The key ingredient in this construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymetrical equations ofmotion. This result then guarantees that the underlying symmetry algebra is represented canonically as well. The algebroid can be restricted to the covariant wedge symmetry algebra which we analyze for non radiative cuts.

## 2. Dispersive vacuum as a decoherence amplifier of an Unruh-DeWitt detector

**Authors:** Pedro H. M. Barros, Helder A. S. Costa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08829v1)

**Summary:**

Discrete spacetime considers that spacetime has a cellular structure on the order of the Planck length. In this paper, we investigated the effects caused by the dispersive vacuum on the decoherence process of an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We calculate the probability transition rates, the probability of finding the detector in the ground state, and the quantum coherence variation. Our results indicate that the decosherence process occurs more quickly in cases with changes in the dispersion relation in the regime of high accelerations.

## 3. Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph

**Authors:** So Matsuura, Kazutoshi Ohta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph. The partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function.

## 4. Integrable deformations of principal chiral model from solutions of   associative Yang-Baxter equation

**Authors:** D. Domanevsky, A. Levin, M. Olshanetsky, A. Zotov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08777v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08777v1)

**Summary:**

We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to the Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models. Using the coefficients of the expansion we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair.

## 5. Quarkonium dynamics in the quantum Brownian regime with non-abelian   quantum master equations

**Authors:** Aoumeur Daddi Hammou, Stéphane Delorme, Jean-Paul Blaizot, Pol-Bernard Gossiaux, Thierry Gousset

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08772v1)

**Summary:**

Quarkonium production in ultrarelativistic heavy ions collisions is one of the best probes of the QGP formed in these collisions. We present exact numerical solutions in a 1D setting of previously derived quantum master equations (QME) in their quantum Brownian regime. Distinctive features of the in-medium bottomonia evolution with the QME are presented; some phenomenological consequences are addressed by considering evolutions for a fixed as well as EPOS4 temperature profiles.

## 6. Scotoseesaw mechanism from a $Z_3$ symmetry of matter

**Authors:** Doan Minh Luong, Phung Van Dong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08711v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the neutrino mass generation and the dark matter stability can be governed by the center of the QCD group. Three right-handed neutrinos transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w,w^2$, where $w=e^{i2\pi/3}$ is the cube root of unity. This leads to a scotoseesaw mechanism in which the seesaw and scotogenic neutrini mass generations are induced by the Majorana and Dirac masses.

## 7. Exploring the Viability of $f(Q, T)$ Gravity: Constraining Parameters   with Cosmological Observations

**Authors:** Rahul Bhagat, Santosh V. Lohakare, B. Mishra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08666v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we explore the model of $ f(Q, T) $ gravity, an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity. The model is developed as an alternative to the standard $Lambda$CDM cosmological model. We also examine cosmographic parameters, confirming the transition of the Universe from deceleration to acceleration. Additionally, the model provides age estimates for the Universe that are consistent with current observations. The results show that the model effectively mimics the standard model while offering an alternative explanation based on modified gravity.

## 8. Dimensional Reduction and Kähler Metric for Metric Moduli in Imaginary   Self-Dual Flux

**Authors:** Andrew R. Frey, Ratul Mahanta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08623v1)

**Summary:**

We present a low-energy 4D effective theory of geometric moduli in a warped Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory with imaginary self-dual 3-form flux. We also give the first derivation of an effective action for flat directions in the complex structure moduli space of the Calabi/Yau. Understanding which effective field theories are consistent with an ultraviolet completion in quantum gravity is an important theoretical question. It is important to know the structure of the 4Deffective theory associated with a given compactification.

## 9. A three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting   D6-branes

**Authors:** Adeel Mansha, Tianjun Li, Mudassar Sabir, Luyang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08590v1)

**Summary:**

We can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry via the supersymmetry preserving Higgs mechanism. We can generate the SM fermion masses and mixings, and break the supers asymmetry via gaugino condensations in the hidden sector. We for the first time construct a three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric PatiSalam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes on a factorizable orientifold with discrete torsion.
