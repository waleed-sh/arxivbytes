## 0. No Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Neutrino Sky Upholds Lorentz   Invariance

**Authors:** Bernanda Telalovic, Mauricio Bustamante

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15468v1)

**Summary:**

Discovering Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) would upend the foundations of modern physics. Because LIV effects grow with energy, high-energy astrophysical neutrinos provide the most sensitive tests of LIV in the neutrino sector. We examine an understudied yet phenomenologically rich LIV signature: compass asymmetries. We find no evidence of L IV-induced flavor anisotropy in 7.5 years of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events.

## 1. Quantized Coulomb branch of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory and   spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type

**Authors:** Yutaka Yoshida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15446v1)

**Summary:**

We study BPS loop operators in a 4d gauge theory with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation. We conjecture that the quantized Coulomb branch of the 4d $Sp(N)$ gauge theory is isomorphic to the spherical DAHA of the double affine Hecke algebra. As evidence for this conjecture, we demonstrate that the Quantization of an 't Hooft loop agrees with the Koornwinder operator.

## 2. Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of   recent progress

**Authors:** Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15398v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15398v1)

**Summary:**

Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N>2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.

## 3. Moduli space metric of the excited vortex

**Authors:** D. Miguélez-Caballero, S. Navarro-Obregón, A. Wereszczynski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15227v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the moduli space metric of a single vortex gets corrections because of the excitation of the radially symmetric shape mode. It leads to a non-zero amount of the shape mode carried by the vortex when moving with a constant velocity. However, due to the radial symmetry, this effect does not reproduce the Lorentz contraction of the moving vortex. We apply the Derrick mode approximation in order to recover the LoreNTz contraction on the level of the collective model. We show that this approximation can be applied to the vortex.

## 4. Primordial correlators from multi-point propagators

**Authors:** Andrea Costantini, Laura Iacconi, David J. Mulryne

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15194v1)

**Summary:**

Numerical methods have been developed that overcome some of the difficulties arising in analytical calculations when the models considered are complex. The PyTransport package, which implements the transport formalism, allows computation of the tree-level 2- and 3-point correlation functions for multi-field models with arbitrary potentials and a curved field space. In this work we investigate an alternative numerical implementation of the transport approach, based on the use of transfer ''matrices'' called multi-point propagators (MPP)

## 5. Noncommutative Quasinormal Modes and the Violation of Isospectrality

**Authors:** Nikola Herceg, Tajron Jurić, A. Naveena Kumara, Andjelo Samsarov, Ivica Smolić

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15181v1)

**Summary:**

We explore quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Schwarzschild black hole under a noncommutative (NC) deformation of spacetime. Our results show that whereas the commutative case preserves the isospectrality of axial and polar modes,Noncommutativity systematically violates this degeneracy. The discrepancy grows with the strength of the NC parameter, becoming evident through distinct real and imaginary parts in the ringdown frequencies. These findings highlight the potential of black hole QNMs to serve as probes of quantum-spacetime corrections in strong-field regimes.

## 6. The integrable Bullough-Dodd model under celestial holography

**Authors:** Minjia Wang, Wei Fan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15174v1)

**Summary:**

We study celestial amplitudes for the S-matrix of the 2d integrable Bullough-Dodd model. This model has bound states that appear as poles in the physics strip of its 2d S-Matrix. The celestial bootstrap can be decomposed into a finite-dimensional linear space, whose base-integrals evaluate into harmonic numbers. This clean structure replaces the complicated integration with simple algebra of elementary functions, and the celestial boot strap reduces to a programmable recursion process of simple algebra.

## 7. Fine-tunings in nucleosynthesis and the emergence of life: Status and   perspectives

**Authors:** Ulf-G. Meißner, Bernard Ch. Metsch, Helen Meyer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15162v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars. We draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.

## 8. Non-Hermitian electron-positron annihilation under thermal effects

**Authors:** D. S. Cabral, A. F. Santos, R. Bufalo, N. B. Xavier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15155v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we examine the thermal effects in a non-hermitian extension of QED. We compute the thermal contributions to this scattering cross-section within the Thermo Field Dynamics approach. We have considered some limits of interest: i) zero-temperature limit and high-energy limit and ii) high-tem temperature regime. Since this type of scattering possesses accurate experimental data for the cross- section it can be used to set stringent bounds upon the non-Hermitian parameters.

## 9. Diagonalization Procedure for Reducible Massless N=1 Supermultiplets

**Authors:** Keith Glennon, Mirian Tsulaia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14964v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14964v1)

**Summary:**

We consider N=1 supersymmetric systems in d=4, 6 and 10 dimensions. They consist of reducible bosonic and fermionic massless representations of the Poincare group. We show in detail how to decompose the corresponding Lagrangians into a sum of Lagrangian for irreducible representations. We also outline a modification of this procedure in the case of an anti-de Sitter background. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 10. Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology

**Authors:** John Joseph Carrasco, Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde, Diederik Roest

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904v1)

**Summary:**

Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions. The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. The potential in theAxion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation. The axion field remains nearly massless.

## 11. Phases and propagation of closed p-brane

**Authors:** Kiyoharu Kawana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14902v1)

**Summary:**

We study phases and propagation of closed $p$-brane within the framework of effective field theory with higher-form global symmetries. We extend our previous studies by including the kinetic term of the center-of-mass motion as well as the relative motions constructed by the area derivatives. This inclusion gives rise to another scalar Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase, enriching the phase structures. We show that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is invalid in the point-particle limit.
