## 0. Holographic duality from Howe duality: Chern-Simons gravity as an   ensemble of code CFTs

**Authors:** Anatoly Dymarsky, Johan Henriksson, Brian McPeak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08724v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. We show that the identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. Finally, we reformulate the duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory. The paper is published by the American Mathematical Society.

## 1. Deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's Instantons on Bryant-Salamon   $Spin(7)$-Manifold

**Authors:** Tathagata Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08723v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08723v1)

**Summary:**

The Bryant-Salamon $Spin(7)$-Manifold -- the negative spinor bundle of $S^4$ -- is an asymptotically conical manifold where the link is the squashed $7$-sphere. We use the deformation theory developed by the author in a previous paper to calculate the deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's instantons. We also calculate the virtual dimensions of the moduli spaces. The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics.

## 2. Symmetry Resolved Entanglement with $U(1)$ Symmetry: Some Closed   Formulae for Excited States

**Authors:** Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo, Lucía Santamaría-Sanz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08668v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we revisit a problem we addressed in previous publications with various collaborators, that is, the computation of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropies of zero-density excited states in infinite volume. The universal nature of the charged moments of these states has already been noted previously. Here, we investigate this problem further, by writing general formulae for the entropie of excited states consisting of an arbitrary number of subsets of identical excitations. When the initial state is written in terms of qubits with appropriate probabilistic coefficients, we find the final formulAE to be of a combinatorial nature too.

## 3. The LSZ reduction formula from homotopy algebras

**Authors:** Keisuke Konosu, Yuji Okawa, Shono Shibuya, Jojiro Totsuka-Yoshinaka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08653v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08653v1)

**Summary:**

The LSZ reduction formula can be extended to loop amplitudes. The evaluation of each Feynman diagram may fail to be well defined because of mass renormalization. This paper presents a formula for connected correlation functions based on quantum $A_\infty$ algebras. We use it to discuss the relation between the LSZ Reduction formula and the extension of the minimal model to loop amplify. The paper is published in the online edition of the Journal of Quantum Theory and Theory.

## 4. Scale separation, rolling solutions and entropy bounds

**Authors:** David Andriot, Niccolò Cribiori, Thomas Van Riet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08634v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit scale separation for compactifications of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. For cosmological solutions rolling down flux-generated potentials, we observe that scale separation is achieved as time flows. This is realized without the need of orientifolds nor corrections to the classical supergravity approximation. We then confront scale separation with the Covariant Entropy Bound (CEB) and the CKN bound. We show that a naive application of these bounds to vacua hints at the existence of at least two extra dimensions.

## 5. Scalar subleading soft theorems from an infinite tower of charges

**Authors:** Matías Briceño, Hernán A. González, Alfredo Pérez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08612v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08612v1)

**Summary:**

We construct an infinite tower of charges that arise from the subleading equations of motion at null infinity. These expressions are finite from the outset, requiring no holographic renormalization. We demonstrate that these symmetries lead to an infinite set of subleading soft relations, valid at leading order in a cubic interaction with massive scalar fields. We show that this tower of surface integrals commutes with the S-matrix of the interacting model. We investigate the emergence of infinite-dimensional symmetry in the absence of gauge invariance by analyzing massless scalar theories.

## 6. Bootstrapping Shape Invariance: Numerical Bootstrap as a Detector of   Solvable Systems

**Authors:** Yu Aikawa, Takeshi Morita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08586v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08586v1)

**Summary:**

Numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the boot strap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. The method can also be used to solve one-dimensional quantum mechanics.

## 7. Regular BTZ black holes from an infinite tower of corrections

**Authors:** Pedro G. S. Fernandes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08565v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08565v1)

**Summary:**

We explore $2+1$-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived from well-defined dimensional regularizations of the Lovelock invariants. In the limit where an infinite series of corrections is included, we obtain theories that admit fully regular black hole solutions. We analyze the properties of these regular black holes, investigate geodesics in these spacetimes, and examine the tidal forces, finding they remain finite everywhere. We conclude with the conclusion that black holes are fully regular.

## 8. Acoustic black holes in BECs with an extended sonic region

**Authors:** Daniel Peñalver, Marco De Vito, Roberto Balbinot, Alessandro Fabbri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08564v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08564v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the modifications of the emission spectrum caused by a finite width of the sonic transition region connecting the subsonic to supersonic flow. In the context of Hawking-like radiation in sonic black holes formed by BECs we look at the effect of a narrow gap in the transition region. We find that this narrow gap can have a significant effect on the spectrum of the radiation emitted by the black hole. We also find that it has a significant impact on the formation of black holes in the universe.

## 9. Screened volume law of Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Holographic   Spontaneous Vectorization model

**Authors:** Chong-Ye Chen, Guang-Zai Ye, Peng Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08549v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08549v1)

**Summary:**

We present a holographic study of spontaneous vectorization in the background of an isotropic asymptotically AdS black brane. We demonstrate how the effective mass of the vector field drives tachyonic instability, leading to a transition from the AdS-RN phase to a vectorized phase. A central discovery is the emergence of a ``screened volume law'' in the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) These results establish spontaneous vectorized as a mechanism for generating novel entanglements structures in holographic systems, with implications for quantum information.

## 10. Delta functions on twistor space and their sign factors

**Authors:** Jun-ichi Note

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08523v1)

**Summary:**

Previous studies conjectured that sign factors are intrinsic in the real twistor space corresponding to the split signature space-time. In this study, we present a new geometrical interpretation of the sign factors. We also propose a new definition of delta functions on the complex twistorspace in terms of the Cech cohomology group without any sign factors and show that these delta functions have conformal inviolable functionality. We show that the inverse Fourier transforms of these delta function are the scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory.

## 11. Perturbative Distinguishability of Black Hole Microstates from AdS/CFT   Correspondence

**Authors:** Jiaju Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08402v1)

**Summary:**

We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the short interval expansion of subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for trace distance. This result demonstrates that quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation. We present our results in the latest issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 12. Boundary Scattering and Non-invertible Symmetries in 1+1 Dimensions

**Authors:** Soichiro Shimamori, Satoshi Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08375v1)

**Summary:**

Recent studies have revealed that when non-invertible symmetries are spontaneously broken, the conventional crossing relation of the S-matrix is modified by the effects of the corresponding topological quantum field theory. In this paper, we extend these considerations to $(1+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries. As a concrete example of the boundary scattering, we analyze kink scattering in the gapped theory obtained from the $\Phi_{(1,3)}$-deformation of a minimal model.

## 13. Einstein ring of dust shells with quantum hair

**Authors:** Sojeong Cheong, Wontae Kim, Mungon Nam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08343v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08343v1)

**Summary:**

The information about the internal structure of a compact object is classically inaccessible to external observers. In this paper, we investigate how quantum corrections to gravitational fields can reveal theinternal structure of compact objects. Compared to the classical scenario, the deflection angle and the corresponding Einstein angle differ by a term that depends explicitly on the number of dust shells, which play the role of quantum hair. The results show that the internal structures of compact object with identical mass and radius can be distinguished by quantum hair through their lensing observables.

## 14. Rational Extension of Quantum Anisotropic Oscillator Potentials with   Linear and/or Quadratic Perturbations

**Authors:** Rajesh Kumar Yadav, Rajesh Kumar, Avinash Khare

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08236v1)

**Summary:**

We present a comprehensive study of the rational extension of the quantum anisotropic harmonic oscillator (QAHO) potentials with linear and/or quadratic perturbations. For the one-dimensional harmonic. oscillator plus imaginary linear perturbation ($i\lambda x$), we show that the rational. extension is possible not only for the even but also for the odd co-dimensions $m$. In two-dimensional case, we construct the rational extensions for QAHO potentials. with quadratics ($\lambda \, xy$) perturbated both when $\lambda$ is real or imaginary and obtain their solutions. Finally, we extend the discussion to the three-dimensional Q AHO
