## 0. Shift orbifolds, decompactification limits, and lattices

**Authors:** Dan Israel, Ilarion V. Melnikov, Yann Proto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18453v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18453v1)

**Summary:**

We describe the general shift orbifold of a Narain CFT and use this to investigate decompactification limits in the heterotic Narain moduli space. We also comment on higher rank theories and describe some applications to the CFT based on the Leech lattice and its shift orb ifolds. We conclude with a look at some of the applications of the Narain lattice to the study of higher rank theory and the theory of higher order lattices. The study was published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics.

## 1. Constraining all possible Korteweg-de Vries type hierarchies

**Authors:** Lukas W. Lindwasser

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18451v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18451v1)

**Summary:**

The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. We find general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. In so doing, we find constraints on all possible integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type. For example, we show that $j=\partial_-\phi$ is a Lie algebra.

## 2. Min-reflected entropy = doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information   of order 1/2

**Authors:** Laura Burri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18433v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18433v1)

**Summary:**

Renyi reflected entropies of order $n \geq 2$ are correlation measures that have been introduced in the field of holography. We show that, for general bipartite quantum states, this measure is identical to another measure originating from the quantum information theory. We demonstrate how this equality enables us to answer several previously open questions, each concerning one of the two correlation measures (or generalizations of them) and how it can be generalized to other types of quantum states.

## 3. On the momentum space structure of the quark propagator

**Authors:** O. Oliveira, T. Frederico, W. de Paula

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18335v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18335v1)

**Summary:**

The structure of the quark propagator in momentum space is explored taking into account non-perturbative QCD dynamics constraints. The pole mass reproduces the constituent quark mass used in the quarks models. The confrontation of our results with lattice data for the full QCD quark propagateator data are in good agreement. We are able to provide estimations for these quantities, for $f_\pi$ and for the shared pole mass. For the Bethe-Salpeter vertex and amplitude, in the chiral limit, we were able to determine the quantities.

## 4. Scalar fields with impurities in arbitrary dimensions: first-order   framework and exact solutions

**Authors:** D. Bazeia, M. A. Marques, R. Menezes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18287v1)

**Summary:**

We study a class of scalar field models coupled to impurities in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. The system admits the introduction of a second-order tensor that can be forced to obey an equality, if a first-order differential equation is satisfied. The results show that exact solutions can be obtained in arbitrary dimensions, related to the presence of the first- order equation. In the case of static solutions, the energy density of the system can equal the divergence of an auxiliary vector function, which is included to help solve the model.

## 5. Viscosity, entanglement and acceleration

**Authors:** Dmitry D. Lapygin, Georgy Yu. Prokhorov, Oleg V. Teryaev, Valentin I. Zakharov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18199v1)

**Summary:**

The Minkowski vacuum in an accelerated frame behaves like a fluid that has a finite temperature. The origin of this viscosity is believed to be related to entanglement introduced by the Rindler horizon. We show that locally the ratio of vis cosity to entropy density can be below the limiting value $ 1/4\pi $ at distances of the order of the thickness of the membrane corresponding to the stretched horizon. In particular, on the membrane surface $ \eta/s=1/8\pi$

## 6. Bispectrum at NLO in single field inflation: conservation and squeezed   limit

**Authors:** Ignatios Antoniadis, Auttakit Chatrabhuti, Jules Cunat, Hiroshi Isono

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18187v1)

**Summary:**

In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation. We found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.

## 7. Logarithmic Corrections for Near-extremal Kerr-Newman Black Holes

**Authors:** Ashes Modak, Aditya Singh, Binata Panda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18173v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we have computed the logarithmic corrections of entropy for the near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in supergravity theory. We apply the Euclidean path integral approach in theNear-horizon geometry. This result should be reproduced by any microscopic theory that explains the entropy of the black hole. We determine these corrections implementing a modified heat kernel approach which involves both the extremal and near-Extremal corrections and is novel in the literature for the charged rotating black holes.

## 8. Symplectic (Non-)Invariance of the Free Energy in Topological Recursion

**Authors:** Alexander Hock

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18115v1)

**Summary:**

Let $F_g$ be the free energy derived from Topological Recursion for a given spectral curve on a compact Riemann surface. $x$-$y$ duality within the theory of (Logarithmic) Topologicalrecursion is nonzero. The free energy is not generally invariant under the swap of $x $ and $y$ However, a new formula for this difference for all $g\geq 2$ can be derived. The derived formulas are particularly useful for spectral curves with a trivial $x-$Y$ dual side. In such cases, one obtains an explicit result for $F _g^\vee$.

## 9. $\mathcal{N}=4$ line defect correlators of type BCD

**Authors:** Yasuyuki Hatsuda, Hai Lin, Tadashi Okazaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18110v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the line defect correlation functions decorating the supersymmetric indices of super Yang-Mills theories. We obtain exact closed-form expressions for the correlators by means of combinatorial methods associated with the group characters. The exact results for the large $N$ correlators lead to the gravity indices for the gravity dual spectrum of the fluctuations of the fundamental string wrapping $AdS_2$ and those of the fat string, the D5-brane wrapping $ ads2.

## 10. Quantum Wishlist: Lessons from Parton Showers

**Authors:** Masahito Yamazaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18059v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss general criteria that could guide us in applying quantum algorithms/computers to problems in high-energy physics. We discuss the particular example of parton showers with quantum interference. We highlight the importance of quantum/classical hybrid algorithms. Our finding could serve as a useful case study for further exploration of quantum algorithms and computers in the field of high- energy physics.

## 11. Analysis of s-t symmetric classical S-matrices

**Authors:** Abhijit Gadde, Shraiyance Jain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18033v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the complex analytic properties of Classical (tree-level) S-matrices for four scalar particles with s-t crossing symmetry, involving an infinite number of exchanges. Under suitable analytic conditions, we demonstrate that such S- Matrices exhibit a spectrum of poles that is equally spaced. We extend this result to S- matrices with accumulating poles, proving that under analogous conditions, their pole spectrum coincides with that of the Coon S-Matrix. We encounter functions that have novel non-isolated singularities akin to what is called the natural boundary.

## 12. Worldline geometries for scattering amplitudes

**Authors:** Roberto Bonezzi, Maria Foteini Kallimani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18030v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we construct the path integral for infinite and semi-infinite scalar worldlines. We show that, at the asymptotic endpoints, on-shell physical states can be generated by inserting vertex operators at infinity. This procedure implements automatically the LSZ reduction, thus leading to a direct worldline representation of scattering amplitudes. We envisage that, when suitably extended to gauge theories, it could provide useful insights in addressing current research issues, such as color-kinematics duality.

## 13. Hairless Black Hole by Superradiance

**Authors:** Sebastian Garcia-Saenz, Guangzhou Guo, Peng Wang, Xinmiao Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18003v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18003v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the interplaying effects of black hole scalarization and superradiance in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model. The combination of the two effects may thus be seen as a particularly efficient mechanism for the extraction of energy from a black hole. We accurately compute the amounts of energy transfer in different channels by deriving formulae for the energy fluxes of matter fields in the presence of a dynamical horizon, which are amenable for evaluation in numerical relativity calculations.

## 14. A Perspective on Symbolic Machine Learning in Physical Sciences

**Authors:** Nour Makke, Sanjay Chawla

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17993v1)

**Summary:**

Machine learning is rapidly making its pathway across all of the natural sciences. The rate at which ML is impacting non-scientific disciplines is incomparable to that in the physical sciences. This is partly due to the uninterpretable nature of deep neural networks. Symbolic machine learning stands as an equal and complementary partner to numerical machine learning in speeding up scientific discovery in physics. This perspective discusses the main differences between the ML and scientific approaches. It stresses the need to develop and apply symbolic machine learning to physics problems equally.

## 15. Transitions of three-charge black hole microstates in the D1D5 CFT

**Authors:** Shaun D. Hampton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17847v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17847v1)

**Summary:**

Using the D1D5 CFT we investigate transitions involving a member of a certain class of states called superstrata states. We study these transitions by deforming the CFT away from the free orbifold point using a marginal deformation which contains a twist operator and a supercharge operator. We compare the resulting amplitude for various initial and final state energies to determine the preferred transition process. This may give hints as to how the dual superstratum geometry may preferentially back-react in this setting.
