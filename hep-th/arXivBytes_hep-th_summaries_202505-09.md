## 0. Screened Axio-dilaton Cosmology: Novel Forms of Early Dark Energy

**Authors:** Adam Smith, Philippe Brax, Carsten van de Bruck, C. P. Burgess, Anne-Christine Davis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05450v1)

**Summary:**

We study the cosmology of multi-field Dark Energy using a well-motivated axio-dilaton model. The required axion-matter couplings also modify cosmology, with the axion's background energy density turning out to resemble early dark energy. We find that increasing the dilaton-matter coupling decreases the growth of structure due to enhanced Hubble friction, an effect that dominates the usual fifth-force effects that amplify structure growth. We explore the implications of these models for the Cosmic Microwave Background and the grow of structure.

## 1. Quantum effects in rotating thermal states on anti-de Sitter space-time

**Authors:** Jacob C. Thompson, Elizabeth Winstanley

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05448v1)

**Summary:**

We study the stress-energy tensor of a massless, conformally coupled, quantum scalar field in a rigidly-rotating thermal state on three- and four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time. We use relativistic kinetic theory, modelling the field as a thermal gas of massless bosons. We then compute the renormalized stress- Energy Tensor of the field in quantum field theory and compare it with that resulting from relativists kinetic theory.

## 2. Boundary Energy-Momentum Tensors for Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes

**Authors:** Jelle Hartong, Emil Have, Vijay Nenmeli, Gerben Oling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05432v1)

**Summary:**

We consider 3D and 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes near future null infinity endowed with the most general allowed Carroll geometry. We define a boundary energy-momentum tensor by varying the on-shell action with respect to the Carroll metric data. This requires adding counterterms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We show that, in 4D, the shear is on par with the Carroll metrics. The resulting complex is equivalent to the Bondi mass and angular momentum loss equations.

## 3. Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as ultra-long period objects after a   dormant cooling epoch

**Authors:** Arthur G. Suvorov, Clara Dehman, José A. Pons

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373v1)

**Summary:**

Ultra-long period transients (ULPs) are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for isolated ULPs, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution.

## 4. BMS representations for generic supermomentum

**Authors:** Xavier Bekaert, Yannick Herfray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05368v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the classification, and give explicit realisations, of unitary irreducible representations of the BMS group. As compared to McCarthy's seminal work, we make use of a unique, Lorentz-invariant, decomposition of supermomenta into a hard and a soft piece. We demonstrate on an example that generic BMS particles are flexible enough to encode memory, as opposed to usual Poincar\'e particles. This is physically relevant because this amounts to reading off the field content of a given BMS state in terms of a choice of gravity vacuum.

## 5. Reassessing the foundations of Metric-Affine Gravity

**Authors:** J. François, L. Ravera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05349v1)

**Summary:**

We reassess foundational aspects of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) in light of the Dressing Field Method. We first recall that Cartan geometry is the proper mathematical foundation for gauge theories of gravity. Then, we show how the MAG kinematics is obtained via dressing in a technically streamlined way, which highlights that it reduces to a Cartan-geometric kinematic. We conclude with a look at the current state of the art in the field of gravitational theory and research.

## 6. Vacuum stability conditions for new $SU(2)$ multiplets

**Authors:** André Milagre, Darius Jurčiukonis, Luís Lavoura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05272v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the addition to the Standard Model of a scalar $SU(2)$ multiplet with dimension $n$ going from $1$ to $6. The multiplet is assumed to have null vacuum expectation value and an arbitrary (free) hypercharge. We determine the shape of the phase space for the new terms that appear in the scalar potential (SP) We observe in particular that, in the case of a 6-plet, thePhase space is slightly concave along one of its boundaries.

## 7. Effective ALP-Photon Coupling in External Magnetic Fields

**Authors:** Ozan Semin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05247v1)

**Summary:**

The Primakoff effect is central to detecting axion-like particles in astrophysical settings and terrestrial experiments. Accurately predicting the interaction rate requires accounting for quantum corrections. Our work tackles this by employing magnetically enhanced fermion propagators derived using Schwinger's proper time method and a systematic Lorentz decomposition using the Ritus basis. We evaluate the triangle loop diagram exactly, avoiding approximations on field strength or particle kinematics. We present a complete calculation of the one-loop fermionic correction to the effective coupling between axions and photons.

## 8. Spectral structure of fluctuations around $n$-vortices in the   Abelian-Higgs model

**Authors:** A. Alonso-Izquierdo, D. Miguélez-Caballero, J. Queiruga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05039v1)

**Summary:**

We study in detail the internal structure of rotationally invariant higher-charge Abelian-Higgs vortices. The symmetry of the normal modes close to the critical regime determines the possible disintegration channels. We find modes that conserve the vortex symmetry (Derrick type modes) and modes whose symmetry differs (multipolar modes). The full internal mode structure is discussed, finding modes that conserv the vortex symmetries and modes that don't. We conclude with a discussion of the structure of the Abelian Higgs system.

## 9. Ghost-induced phase transition in the final stages of black hole   evaporation

**Authors:** Alfio Bonanno, Samuele Silveravalle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05027v1)

**Summary:**

A quantum-induced ghost instability drives the natural evolution of an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole toward a stable naked singularity. This process, arising from quadratic curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high energies, circumvents inconsistencies associated with classical naked singularities. The onset of ghost-driven instability signals a phase transition that fundamentally alters black hole evaporation, rendering the information paradox moot as it merges with the singularity issue. Our findings suggest a new pathway for black hole evolution at high-energy scales.

## 10. Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac Fermions on   Honeycomb lattice

**Authors:** Ankush Chaubey, Basudeb Mondal, Vijay B. Shenoy, Subhro Bhattacharjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04945v1)

**Summary:**

We study superconducting (SC) phases that are naturally proximate to a spin-orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac semi-metal on a honeycomb lattice. This system, which offers enhanced low-energy symmetries, presents an interesting platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity in j=3/2 electrons. This study allows for understanding the global phase diagram of such systems, stimulating further experimental work on candidate materials such as metallic halides. Further, it provides the starting point for the exploration of unconventional phase transitions in such systems.

## 11. Thermodynamic relation on black branes with arbitrary cosmological   constant

**Authors:** Yubo Ma, Songtao Zheng, Yang Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04909v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04909v1)

**Summary:**

Goon-Penco(GP) relationship preserved its form in four-dimensional and (n+1)-dimensional spacetimes. GP relation exhibits universality across all states of the black hole, including those associated with the event horizon and the cosmological horizon. These findings confirm that the GP relationship remains valid for (n-1-dimensional black holes and black branes with an arbitrarycosmological constant, independent of the coordinate system employed. It also demonstrates its universal behavior with respect to dimensionality.
