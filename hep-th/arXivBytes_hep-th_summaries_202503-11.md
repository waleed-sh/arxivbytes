## 0. Towards construction of superintegrable basis in matrix models

**Authors:** Azheev Batukhan, Nikita Tselousov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07583v1)

**Summary:**

We develop methods for systematic construction of superintegrable polynomials in matrix/eigenvalue models. We detail our method in case of the Gaussian Hermitian model, and then apply it to the cubic Kontsevich model. The main two assumptions are box adding/removing rule (Pierri rule) and existence of Hamiltonian for superIntegrable Polynomial. We propose a set of assumptions that may allow one to recover superintegRable polynnomials.

## 1. Anomaly Equation of the Large U(1) Chiral Symmetry

**Authors:** Shingo Takeuchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07525v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we first heuristically constitute the charges for the chiral transformation associated with the large U(1) gauge symmetry. Then, showing that those can be obtained based on Noether's theorem, we once obtain the anomaly equation associated with those large chiral transformations. It is also shown that those anomaly equations can be derived in Fujikawa method. The result in this study would be important as a development of the big gauge symmetry in the fermionic field. The study was published in the Journal of Theoretical Physics.

## 2. Holographic QCD Running Coupling for Heavy Quarks in Strong Magnetic   Field

**Authors:** Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Ali Hajilou, Alexander Nikolaev, Pavel Slepov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07521v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07521v1)

**Summary:**

We extend our previous work [arXiv:2407.11924], which investigated the influence of a magnetic field on the running coupling constant in a bottom-up holographic light-quark model. To achieve this, we employ a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton background that captures the essential features of heavy quark dynamics. The running coupling for heavy quarks decreases in the presence of a strong external magnetic field at fixed temperature and chemical potential. However, near the 1st order phase transitions, the behavior of $\alpha$ is analogous for both cases.

## 3. Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum

**Authors:** I. Y. Park, P. Y. Wui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to thecosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmology model to include additional density parameters. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmologically parameter estimation. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the density parameters improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values.

## 4. On the cosmological degrees of freedom of Proca field with non-minimal   coupling to gravity

**Authors:** Antonio De Felice, Anamaria Hell

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07454v1)

**Summary:**

We study Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity through the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar interactions. We show that in the homogeneous and isotropic Universe together with cosmological constant, the temporal component of the vector field acquires a background value. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vectors field. We showed that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory.

## 5. BV description of $N = 1$, $D = 4$ Supegravity in the first order   formalism

**Authors:** Alberto S. Cattaneo, Filippo Fila-Robattino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07373v1)

**Summary:**

This note examines the BV formulation of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in the first-order Palatini--Cartan framework. Challenges in achieving an off-shell formulation are addressed by introducing corrections to the rank 2 BV action. It offers in addition a solid foundation for the study of the theory on manifolds with boundary. For more information on this topic, visit: http://www.theoryonmanifolds.org/supergravity.

## 7. Exact Three-Point Functions in $\mathcal{N}=2$ Superconformal Field   Theories: Integrability vs. Localization

**Authors:** Gwenaël Ferrando, Shota Komatsu, Gabriel Lefundes, Didina Serban

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07295v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an integrability approach for planar three-point functions at finite coupling in superconformal field theories. We reproduce the structure constants of Coulomb branch operators, previously obtained by supersymmetric localization as exact functions of the 't Hooft coupling. Our analysis explains the common physical origin of Fredholm kernels inintegrability and localization, and hints at structures after the resummation in the hexagon formalism. We conclude with an analysis of the structure of the super Yang-Mills field theory.

## 8. $κ$-symmetric M5 brane web for defects in $AdS_7 / CFT_6$   holography

**Authors:** Varun Gupta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07262v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we will continue our analysis of some general probe M5 brane solutions. These are codimension-2 in $AdS_7$ and preserve at least 2 supercharges when the worldvolume 3-form flux field strength is zero. We will turn on the field strength and find that the embedding conditions are modified, excluding certain branes contained in the previous result. The new main result here is very general, so we pick simpler embedding Conditions that describe highly symmetric examples.

## 9. Some Thermal Properties of Ideal Gas

**Authors:** Rajesh Kumar Gupta, Meenu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07261v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we investigate the thermal properties of non-relativistic many-body systems at finite temperature and chemical potential. The one-point function is non-zero only for operators with zero particle numbers. We also study the ideal system by placing it on curved spatial surfaces, specifically spherical surfaces. We compute the partition function and Green's function on spheres, squashed-sphere and hemispheres. Finally, we compute the large radius corrections to the partition and Green’s function by expanding in the big radius limit.

## 10. Compactification of Anisotropies in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet   Cosmology

**Authors:** Alex Giacomini, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Alexey Toporensky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes. We find that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe. The study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetime where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropIC configurations where all scale factors evolve identically.

## 11. Star-products for Lie-algebraic noncommutative Minkowski space-times

**Authors:** Valentine Maris, Filip Požar, Jean-Christophe Wallet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07176v1)

**Summary:**

Poisson structures of the Poincar\'e group can be linked to deformations of the Minkowski space-time, classified some time ago. We determine the Hopf algebras modeling the deformed relativistic symmetries, which appear to be either a deformation of the usual (Hopf) Poincare algebra or an enlarged algebra. We show that the usual Lebesgue integral defines either a trace or a KMS weight depending on whether the Lie group of the coordinates' Lie algebra is unimodular or not.

## 12. Towards low-dimensionalization of four-dimensional QCD

**Authors:** Kei Tohme, Hideo Suganuma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07089v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07089v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a possible way of low-dimensionalization of 4D QCD. We use gauge degrees of freedom and propose a new gauge fixing of "dimensional reduction (DR) gauge" In the DR gauge, the amplitudes of two gluon components are found to be strongly suppressed. We reduce QCD to 2D with the coupling $g_{2D} = g/\xi$, which approximately reproduces the string tension. We investigate the spatial correlation of two $t$-directed gluons and find that the correlation decreases as $e^{-mr}$ decreases.

## 13. The history of the Arcetri Physics Institute from the 1920s to the end   of the 1960s

**Authors:** Daniele Dominici

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07045v1)

**Summary:**

The history of the Arcetri Institute of Physics at the University of Florence is analyzed from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s. The Institute hosted brilliant young physicists such as Rita Brunetti, Enrico Fermi, Franco Rasetti in the '20s and Enrici Persico, Bruno Rossi, Gilberto Bernardini, Daria Bocciarelli, Lorenzo Emo Capodilista, Giuseppe Occhialini and Giulio Racah. After the war, some students of this school formed research groups in the fields of nuclear physics and elementary particle physics.

## 14. Integrable deformed H$_{_{4}}$ WZW models and their non-Abelian duals as   solutions of generalized supergravity equations

**Authors:** Ali Eghbali, Simin Ghasemi-Sorkhabi, Adel Rezaei-Aghdam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07040v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07040v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed backgrounds of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model can be considered as solutions of the generalized supergravity equations (GSEs) Using the Poisson-Lie T-duality approach in the presence of spectators, we obtain the non-Abelian duals of those models. It is shown that all dual models (except for one model) are integrable and satisfy the GSEs.

## 15. Large $θ$ angle in two-dimensional large $N$ $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$   model

**Authors:** Tsubasa Sugeno, Takahiro Yokokura, Kazuya Yonekura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07012v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07012v1)

**Summary:**

In confining large $N$ theories with a $2\pi$ angle, there are multiple metastable vacua. We investigate this parameter region in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model. We discuss why it might not be straightforward to resolve this problem. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results for the vacuum energies and decay rates of metastable Vacua. The paper is published as part of a two-book series on quantum mechanics.

## 16. A new rotating black hole from the Newman-Janis algorithm

**Authors:** Hyeong-Chan Kim, Wonwoo Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06961v1)

**Summary:**

We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. We use the Newman-Janis algorithm as a mathematical tool that reduces a general rotating metric into a tractable form by applying simple physical requirements. Interestingly, the solution we found may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby challenging the no-hair theorem. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics (hair) affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.

## 17. Spin of fractional quantum Hall neutral modes and "missing states" on a   sphere

**Authors:** Dung Xuan Nguyen, Dam Thanh Son

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06914v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06914v1)

**Summary:**

A low-energy neutral quasiparticle in a fractional quantum Hall system appears in the latter's energy spectrum on a sphere. We argue that the signature of a nonvanishing spin (intrinsic angular momentum) $s$ is the absence, in this series, of states with total angular momentum less than $s$. We reinterpret the missing of certain states, observed in an exact-diagonalization calculation of the spectrum of the $\nu=7/3$ FQH state in a wide quantum well.

## 18. Hidden momentum of composite bodies and magnetic dipoles

**Authors:** Bruno Klajn, Hrvoje Nikolić

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06910v1)

**Summary:**

Hidden momentum is a puzzling phenomenon associated with magnetic dipoles and other extended relativistic systems. The origin of hidden momentum lies in the effective change of individual particle masses of a composite body. Defining the hidden momentum as the difference between the total momentum and the center-of-mass momentum, we explain in detail how hidden momentum arises in certain simple non-relativistic. systems. We conclude that hidden momentum can only be explained in terms of velocity-dependent 'relatvistic mass'

## 19. Quasi-Palatini Formulation of Scalar-Tensor Gravity

**Authors:** Sotirios Karamitsos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06886v1)

**Summary:**

The Palatini formulation has been successful in the development of several alternative theories of gravity. We propose the "quasi-Palatini" formulation, which gives rise to a continuous family of models. We demonstrate how this leads to a deformation of the potential, studying its impact on observables. We also discuss how the interpolation between different actions can be extended to scalar-torsion and Scalar-nonmetricity models. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 20. Magnetic Casimir effect of a Lorentz-violating scalar with higher order   derivatives

**Authors:** Andrea Erdas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06829v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper I study the Casimir effect caused by a charged and massive scalar field that breaks Lorentz invariance in a CPT-even, aether-like manner. I examine the two scenarios of the field satisfying either Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions on a pair of plane parallel plates. I use the zeta function technique to investigate the effect of a constant magnetic field, perpendicular to the plates, on Casimir energy and pressure. I fully examine both scenarios for both types of boundary conditions.
