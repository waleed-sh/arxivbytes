## 0. Cosmological constraints on small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity

**Authors:** Jing-Zhi Zhou, Zhi-Chao Li, Di Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614v1)

**Summary:**

We study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of the primordial non-Gaussian parameter. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordialPower spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations. We examine the effects of different shapes of thePrimordialPowerSpectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models.

## 1. Off-shell form factor: factorization is violated

**Authors:** A. V. Belitsky, V. A. Smirnov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22595v1)

**Summary:**

The Sudakov form factor on the Coulomb branch of N=4 sYM implies that the former is off-shell in the traditional sense. While the hard region is cleanly separated from the rest, the ultrasoft-collinear modes remain intertwined. We exhibit effects of factorization violation explicitly in the momentum space making use of the infrared power counting. We use a combination of tools to perform required calculations centered around the Method of Regions as the main go-to formalism for asymptotic expansion of emerging parametric Feynman integrals.

## 2. On dual regime in Yang-Baxter deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models

**Authors:** Alexey Bychkov, Alexey Litvinov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22589v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we explore a new class of integrable sigma models, which we refer to as the "dual regime" of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ models. We identify the corresponding one-loop metric and $B-$field and show that they solve the generalized Ricci flow equation. In particular, we show that the new systems provide new perturbations of the sigma model type.

## 3. The old problem of the cosmological constant solved?

**Authors:** Jan Novák, Oem Trivedi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22553v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate an approach to quantum gravity, called the ring paradigm. Gravity is mediated superluminally, and the graviton is described as a phonon on the grid of matter in the Universe. This theory has very interesting applications to cosmology and would ultimately solve the old problem of the cosmological constant. It gives new impulses to the scalar field theories because the gravitational ring decays to some phantom field. As is obvious, we radically break the Lorentz invariance, which means that some generalization of the Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius theorem is possible.

## 4. Renormalizing the Quark-Meson-Diquark Model

**Authors:** Hosein Gholami, Lennart Kurth, Ugo Mire, Michael Buballa, Bernd-Jochen Schaefer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22542v1)

**Summary:**

We present a comprehensive study of the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark (QMD) model. The renormalized QMD allows analytical investigations of key quantities such as the zero-temperature diquark gap and the critical temperature for color superconductivity. We show that the RG-consistent approach yields a phase diagram and thermodynamic properties qualitatively similar to those of the renormalization model. Both treatments recover the expected high-density features characterized by the BCS relation and the Stefan-Boltzmann limit.

## 5. Thermodynamical aspects of fermions in external electromagnetic fields

**Authors:** Romeo Brunetti, Klaus Fredenhagen, Nicola Pinamonti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22413v1)

**Summary:**

For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism. The time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution. The possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can also be investigated.

## 6. Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with   improved inverse distance ladder

**Authors:** Jia-Le Ling, Guo-Hong Du, Tian-Nuo Li, Jing-Fei Zhang, Shao-Jiang Wang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369v1)

**Summary:**

Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective. Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets.

## 7. Probing nuclear structure in relativistic p-O and O-O collisions at the   LHC through the measurement of anisotropic flow coefficients

**Authors:** Aswathy Menon K R, Suraj Prasad, Neelkamal Mallick, Raghunath Sahoo, Gergely Gábor Barnaföldi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22367v1)

**Summary:**

RHIC and LHC plan to inject $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei with a focus to investigate collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision systems. The study is performed employing a hybrid model encompassing IPGlasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. We find a small effect of $\alpha$-clustering in p-O, while a significant one for O-O collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of the effect correlates with the size of the $^{4}$He.

## 8. Ageing correlators from local scale-invariance

**Authors:** Malte Henkel, Stoimen Stoimenov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22301v1)

**Summary:**

Form of the two-time autocorrelator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d>2$ dimensions. For ageing systems with dynamical exponent $mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise coming from the thermal bath, the form is more complex.

## 9. A topological invariant in the context of the loop representation of the   massive Kalb-Ramond-Klein-Gordon model

**Authors:** E. Iñiguez, M. Freire, L. Leal, E. Contreras

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22292v1)

**Summary:**

We employ the Dirac procedure to quantize the self-dual massive Kalb-Ramond-Klein-Gordon model in $2+1$ dimensional spacetimes. The canonical fields are expressed in terms of $2$-surfaces and signed points, ensuring the automatic realization of the quantum algebra. As the duality rotation preserving the action can be implemented infinitesimally, we derive the conserved quantity that generates the transformation. Given that such a generator is a two dimensional topological quantity, its representation in Terms of geometrical operators yields a two-dimensional invariant.

## 10. Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of   2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory

**Authors:** Qiang Jia, Zhian Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261v1)

**Summary:**

Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$- dimensional theory. We develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. We demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme for subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$

## 11. Ito calculus meets the Hubble tension: Effects of small-scale electron   density fluctuations on the CMB anisotropies

**Authors:** Jens Chluba, Geoffrey Vasil, Richard Battye

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22242v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22242v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron density fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at last scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic variable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations using Ito calculus. We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble tension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple modifications to the average recombination history arise.

## 12. Moduli of stable supermaps

**Authors:** Ugo Bruzzo, Daniel Hernández Ruipérez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22233v1)

**Summary:**

We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme. We prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by an algebraic superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the modulus superstack.

## 13. Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux   Quanta

**Authors:** Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144v1)

**Summary:**

Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH) are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers. The results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.   Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of F QH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory.

## 14. Massless limit of massive self-interacting vector fields

**Authors:** Nabamita Banerjee, Jitesh Singh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22119v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the massless limit of the quartic self-interacting vector field theory is not smooth. Pathological behavior is not limited only at the classical level, even at the quantum level unitarity is violated at the two-loop. Using the Vainshtein mechanism, we show that it fails beyond the strong-coupling scale. We show that a massless limit is not smooth even in quantum theory. We study massive self interacting  vector field theories with mass added "by hand"

## 15. Perfect fluid equations with N=1,2 Schrodinger supersymmetry

**Authors:** Timofei Snegirev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22043v1)

**Summary:**

Superconformal extensions of the perfect fluid equations are constructed within the Hamiltonian formalism. They are built by introducing real or complex anticommuting field variables as superpartners for the density and velocity of a fluid. The full set of conserved charges associated with the $N=1,2$ Schrodinger superalgebra is constructed. When the Clebsch decomposition for the velocity vector field is used, the anticommuted variables can be interpreted as potentials parameterizing fluid's vorticity.

## 16. Spin polarization of holographic baryon in strongly coupled fluid

**Authors:** Si-wen Li, Shu Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21883v1)

**Summary:**

 spin polarization for baryon in a hydrodynamic medium has been extensively studied in the weakly coupled regime using quantum kinetic theory. This is the first study of this problem in the strongly coupled regime. The structures of the responses are similar to those found in weakly coupling studies. The resulting spectral functions indicate that the holographic baryonic is polarized as responses to fluid acceleration, shear stress and vorticity. The study was published in the journal Applied Physics Letters (APL).

## 17. Scheme Dependence of the One-Loop Domain Wall Tension

**Authors:** Jarah Evslin, Hui Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21856v1)

**Summary:**

The one-loop tension of the domain wall in the 3+1 dimensional $\phi^4$ double-well model was derived long ago using dimensional regularization. The methods used can only be applied to solitons depending on a single dimension. In the past few months, domain wall tensions have been recalculated using spectral methods with Born subtractions and also linearized soliton perturbation theory. It has been shown that the former agrees with the results of Rebhan et al.
