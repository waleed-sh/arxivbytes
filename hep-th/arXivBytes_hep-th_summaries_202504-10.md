## 0. Nonhermitian topological zero modes at smooth domain walls: Exact   solutions

**Authors:** Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07098v1)

**Summary:**

The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of boundary mode in nonhermitian and topologically non-equilibrium states of matter, the authors say. They also unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes.

## 1. Bulk metric reconstruction from entanglement data via minimal surface   area variations

**Authors:** Niko Jokela, Tony Liimatainen, Miika Sarkkinen, Leo Tzou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07016v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07016v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk geometries. By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background. We recover the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do this by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems.

## 2. M-theory boundaries beyond supersymmetry

**Authors:** Miguel Montero, Luis Zapata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06985v1)

**Summary:**

The chiral worldvolume theory of an M-theory boundary (the so-called M9 brane) is uniquely determined by supersymmetry and anomaly inflow. We investigate whether alternative chiral boundary field contents may be allowed by anomaly cancellation. We find one minimal solution with gauge group $G_2$ that satisfies all constraints in a non-trivial way. Therefore, it could in principle describe the low-energy theory of a novel nonsupersymmetric M-Theory boundary condition.

## 3. Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the   impact of collisions

**Authors:** Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Ipsita Mandal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06945v1)

**Summary:**

This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of the generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs) for identifying the excitations. The final results show that the emergent modes are long-lived and robust against the damping effects brought about the collision integral(s)

## 4. Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime

**Authors:** Nitesh Kumar Dubey, Sanved Kolekar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887v1)

**Summary:**

We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density   of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian behavior in the HHI state. Further, we observe that the anti-Hawking   effect enhances the entangler between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation   decreases it.

## 5. Emergent Theory for Constitutive Relations in Classical Defect Systems

**Authors:** Hongrui Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06864v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06864v1)

**Summary:**

We conjecture that Landau-Khalatnikov equation could provide heat constitutive relations when taking heat flux as order parameter. We show that the corresponding effctive Lagrangian has similar form to Wick-rotated complex scalar field theory at non-relativistic limit. We argue that our method could be generalized to other systems besides thermal ones. By analogy with ferroelectrics, we propose the thermal domain model, which is a conserved current XY model. Phase transition of the thermal system is qualitatively discussed in this model.

## 6. Quantum Field Theory on Multifractal Spacetime: Varying Dimension and   Ultraviolet Completeness

**Authors:** Alessio Maiezza, Juan Carlos Vasquez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06797v1)

**Summary:**

We explore quantum field theory where spacetime exhibits scaling properties and dimensional reduction with changing energy scales. Working within canonical quantization, we demonstrate how to properly quantize fields in such multifractal spacetime. This approach guarantees the finiteness of the theory at all orders in perturbation theory and enables rigorous construction of the S-matrix in the interaction picture. The structure tames dominant, large-order divergence sources in the perturbative series and resolves the Landau pole problem through asymptotic safety.

## 7. Emergent Metric from Wavelet-transformed Quantum Field Theory

**Authors:** Šimon Vedl, Daniel J. George, Fil Simovic, Dominic G. Lewis, Nicholas Funai, Achim Kempf, Nicholas Menicucci, Gavin K. Brennen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06698v1)

**Summary:**

A bulk metric is shown to arise from locally computable multiscale correlations of a boundary quantum field theory (QFT) The metric is obtained from the Petz-R\'enyi mutual information using as input the correlations computed from the continuous wavelet transform. The method is applicable to a variety of boundary QFTs that need not be conformal field theories. The emerging metric is asymptotically anti-de Sitter space (AdS) and the parameters fixing the geometry are tunable by changing the chosen wavelet basis.

## 8. On BPS Equations of Generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs Model with   Scalars-Dependent Coupling $θ$-term

**Authors:** Mulyanto, Emir Syahreza Fadhilla, Ardian Nata Atmaja

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06635v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a most general $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model consist of terms up to quadratic in first-derivative of the fields. Using the BPS Lagrangian method we try to find Bogomolnyi's equations for BPS monopoles and dyons. Interestingly we find the value of $\theta$-term's coupling gives additional contribution to electric charge of BPS Dyons, and thus can determine whether we get BPS dyons or monopoles.

## 9. Graviton stimulated emission in squeezed vacuum states

**Authors:** Atsuhisa Ota, Yuhang Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state in a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. We examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem. Backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission.

## 10. A critical theory for solidification of a liquid Fermi liquid

**Authors:** Tarun Grover, John McGreevy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06508v1)

**Summary:**

We give a simple description of a zero-temperature phase transition between a liquid metal and a solid. The critical point has a Fermi surface as well as a Bose surface, a sphere in momentum space of gapless bosonic excitations. We find a fixed point of the renormalization group governing such a non-Fermi liquid. We comment on the nature of the solid phase and possible physical realizations.
