## 0. Navigating string theory field space with geometric flows

**Authors:** Saskia Demulder, Dieter Lust, Thomas Raml

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10364v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10364v1)

**Summary:**

The Swampland Distance Conjecture postulates the emergence of an infinite tower of massless states when approaching infinite-distance points in moduli space. However, most string backgrounds are supported by fluxes, and therefore depart from the purely geometric paradigm. We show that the distance defined in terms of the Perelman entropy functional needs to be refined in order to encompass fluxes. We subsequently construct a geometric flow for internal manifolds supported by Ramond-Ramond fluxes and discuss its role in the Ricci Flow Conjectures.

## 1. Quantum vorticity: a not so effective field theory

**Authors:** Gabriel Cuomo, Fanny Eustachon, Eren Firat, Brian Henning, Riccardo Rattazzi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10344v1)

**Summary:**

We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit.

## 2. Novel electrically charged wormhole, black hole and black bounce exact   solutions in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity

**Authors:** Gabriel I. Róis, José Tarciso S. S. Junior, Francisco S. N. Lobo, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10324v1)

**Summary:**

This paper presents exact solutions for electrically charged wormholes, black holes, and black bounces within the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) framework. HMPG combines features of the metric and Palatini formulations of modified gravity, offering a powerful approach to address challenges in General Relativity. Future work will benefit from extending these solutions to include scalar potentials, addressing both early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, and applying observational data such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave measurements.

## 3. Investigating SU(3) with Nf=8 fundamental fermions at strong   renormalized coupling

**Authors:** Anna Hasenfratz, Oliver Witzel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10322v1)

**Summary:**

Lattice simulations have observed a novel strong coupling symmetric mass generation (SMG) phase. The SMG phase is separated from the weak coupling, conformal phase by a continuous phase transition. This finding suggests that the SU(3) 8-flavor system sits at the opening of the conformal window. The phase transition between the strong and weak coupling phases is likely governed by a merged fixed point that is ultraviolet in the strong coupling but infrared in theweak coupling side. The study was published in the journal Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 014513.

## 4. Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis   algorithm

**Authors:** Jay Bhambure, Rajeev Singh, Derek Teaney

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. We extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.

## 5. Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments

**Authors:** Han-Xie Wang, Shuai A. Chen, Peng Ye

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10280v1)

**Summary:**

Fractonic many-body systems are characterized by mobility restrictions on single-particle hopping due to the conservation of higher moments. This conservation allows the definition of new symmetries and their physical consequences, with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) being especially intriguing in bosonic systems. We propose a new class of phases called hybrid fractonic superfluids (HFS), where multiple boson species interact and moment hybridization is conserved. We investigate ground states, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and the spontaneous breaking of charge symmetry.

## 6. Charged Particle in Lie-Poisson Electrodynamics

**Authors:** B. S. Basilio, V. G. Kupriyanov, M. A. Kurkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10247v1)

**Summary:**

 Lie-Poisson electrodynamics describes the semi-classical limit of non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory. We focus on the mechanics of a charged point-like particle moving in a given gauge background. We illustrate our findings by exploring the exactly solvable Kepler problem in the context of the $\lambda$-Minkowski (or the angular) non-Commutativity, along with other examples. We provide a detailed formulation of the classical action and the corresponding equations of motion, which recover standard relativistic dynamics.

## 7. Path integral measure and cosmological constant

**Authors:** C. Branchina, V. Branchina, F. Contino, A. Pernace

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10194v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the one-loop effective action of quantum gravity using a spherical background. We also consider a free scalar field and a free Dirac field on a spherical gravitational background, and find that the same holds true even in the presence of matter. These results are found without resorting to any supersymmetric embedding of the theory, and shed new light on the cosmological constant problem. We show that, if the measure in the path integral is correctly taken into account, and the physical UV cutoff is properly introduced, we get only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to the UV cutoff.

## 8. The Equivalence Theorem at work: manifestly gauge-invariant Abelian   Higgs model physics

**Authors:** Bram Boeykens, David Dudal, Thomas Oosthuyse

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10172v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10172v1)

**Summary:**

We use an extended BRST symmetry to reexpress the Abelian Higgs model action. Although the ensuing action encompasses an infinite number of vertices, it nevertheless is renormalizable, thanks to the hidden equivalence with the original model. We present an explicit illustration in terms of the gauge-invariant scalar field, its Green's function and corresponding pole mass. Hence, manifestly gauge-Invariant computations are possible. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by Oxford University Press.

## 9. Tensor Product CFTs and One-Character Extensions

**Authors:** Chethan N. Gowdigere, Sachin Kala, Jagannath Santara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10112v1)

**Summary:**

One-character CFTs are obtained as one-character extensions of the tensor products of a single CFT. The characters are $S$-invariant homogenous polynomials of the characters of the CFT, when organised in terms of a $S-invaries basis. We study for $CFTs any two-character WZW CFT with vanishing Wronskian index, (ii) the Ising CFT and (iii) the infinite class of $D_{r,1}$ and the $A_{4,1}.

## 10. Stability of cosmological singularity-free solutions in quadratic   gravity

**Authors:** M. Asorey, F. Ezquerro, M. Pardina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10111v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a large family of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions in quadratic gravity which are singularity-free at early and late times. This kind of smooth solutions only emerges beyond the unstable de Sitter branch. The complete analysis shows that a Big Bang can emerge when the parameters of the theory are slightly modified, revealing the unstable nature of this type of solutions. We have analyzed the stability of these singulary-free solutions by computing the second-order variation of the action.

## 11. Distinct neutrino signatures of quark deconfinement in accretion-induced   collapse of white dwarfs

**Authors:** Juno C. L. Chan, Harry Ho-Yin Ng, Patrick Chi-Kit Cheong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10046v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10046v1)

**Summary:**

The collapse forms a proto-neutron star that continues contracting due to neutrino cooling and the softening effect of mixed nuclear-quark matter. A second bounce triggered by the PT to deconfined quark matter, leading to a stable remnant of proto-hybrid star. The resultant distinct neutrinos bursts and narrow mass range of AIC events offer critical insights into the existence and properties of hybrid stars, including constraints on the onset density of PT. We present the first seconds-long general relativistic neutrini-radiation simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs.

## 12. Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with   Conserved Charges

**Authors:** Feng-Li Lin, Jhh-Jing Hong, Ching-Yu Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09905v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. The validity of the subsystem thermalization. hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative. entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical. states/ eigenstates. We show that the Thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-G GEs.

## 13. An Exactly Soluble Group Field Theory

**Authors:** Luca Marchetti, Hassan Mehmood, Viqar Husain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09851v1)

**Summary:**

We present a Group Field Theory (GFT) quantization of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} (HK) model formulated as a non-interacting GFT. We demonstrate that the path-integral formulation of this HK-GFT provides a completion of a corresponding spinfoam model developed earlier. We also show that the HK- GFT admits a unique Fock representation that describes the quantum three-geometries of the HK model. These results provide a link to the canonical quantization and demonstrate how GFTs can bridge distinct quantization schemes.

## 14. Hydrodynamic and Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities of Q-strings

**Authors:** Qian Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09815v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the linear response of Q-strings to perturbations along the cylindrical direction. The results show that the Q-string exhibits dynamical instability when the perturbation wavelength exceeds a threshold. Such results reveal the hydrodynamic properties of solitons. In the thin-wall limit, this instability degenerates into the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with a threshold related only to the radius of the cylinder. We show that this instability can be characterized by second-order hydrodynamics of viscous fluids.
