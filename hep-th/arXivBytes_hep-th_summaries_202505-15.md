## 0. Phase Diagram Magnetic Features of Holographic Anisotropic Model for   $z^4$-term Heavy Quarks

**Authors:** Kristina Rannu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09580v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09580v1)

**Summary:**

Thermodynamical features depending on magnetic field of the previously found five-dimensional anisotropic holographic solution for heavy quarks supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action are studied. Direct/inverse magnetic catalysis behavior is considered. String tension behavior in magnetic field is discussed. Phase diagram, composed of the 1-st order phase transition and temporal Wilson loops, corresponding to the stable direct magneticCatalysis scenario is presented. The study was published in the journal of condensed matter physics.

## 1. Virasoro Blocks and Trouble at the Euclidean Horizon

**Authors:** Aaditya Datar, Chethan Krishnan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09504v1)

**Summary:**

In the semi-classical ($c \rightarrow \infty$) limit, 4-point HLLH correlators in 2D CFTs exhibit periodic Euclidean singularities. We provide a bulk understanding of these facts and clarify the role of the horizon. We present a bulk geodesic Witten diagram calculation of semi- classical Virasoro blocks in coordinates that are naturally adapted to the BTZ black hole. This allows a bulk geometric interpretation for boundary time separation.

## 2. Shadow Celestial Operator Product Expansions

**Authors:** Elizabeth Himwich, Monica Pate

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09499v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09499v1)

**Summary:**

The linearized massless wave equation in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes is known to admit two families of solutions. The two families are related to each other by a two-dimensional shadow transformation. The scattering states of one family are constructed from standard momentum eigenstates by a Mellin transformation with respect to energy. Their operator product expansion (OPE) is directly related to collinear limits of momentum space amplitudes. We present a useful technical ingredient: the transformation of the OPE coefficients associated to coll inear limits under a shadow.

## 3. Chiral higher-spin theories from twistor space

**Authors:** Lionel Mason, Atul Sharma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09419v1)

**Summary:**

We reformulate chiral higher-spin Yang-Mills and gravity as 'CR-holomorphic' theories of Chern-Simons type. In the most general case, these are Moyal deformed to become non-commutative. We give a perturbative analysis to identify the spectrum and three-point vertices on spacetime and, for flat space, in momentum space. On reduction to spacetime, there are higher valence vertices but these appear to be a gauge artifact. Further generalizations are discussed.

## 4. Probabilistic construction of non compactified imaginary Liouville field   theory

**Authors:** Romain Usciati, Colin Guillarmou, Remi Rhodes, Raoul Santachiara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09390v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a probabilistic construction of imaginary Liouville Field Theory based on a real (non-compactified) Gaussian Free Field. We argue that our theory is the first explicit Lagrangian field theory that reproduces the imaginary DOZZ structure constants without requiring a neutrality constraint. Our proposal is supported by exact results for the imaginary Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos on the circle, and by numerical simulations on the sphere. In particular, we show that the three-point functions of the theory agree remarkably well with the imaginary DoZZ structure constant.

## 5. Quantum signatures in black hole accretion: Pair production in dynamical   magnetic fields

**Authors:** Susobhan Mandal, Tausif Parvez, S. Shankaranarayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09355v1)

**Summary:**

Accretion disks around black holes host extreme conditions where general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics dominate. These disks exhibit two distinct dynamical regimes -- Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) and Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) In the MAD regime, these systems exhibit magnetic fields up to $10^8$ G and variability on gravitational timescales. Here, we employ quantum field theory in background gauge fields to demonstrate that the dynamic magnetic fields of MADs drive significant pair production via the Schwinger mechanism.

## 6. Near-horizon behavior of nonequatorial accelerated particle motion and   high energy particle collisions

**Authors:** H. V. Ovcharenko, O. B. Zaslavskii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09330v1)

**Summary:**

We consider motion of a particle in the background of a stationary axially symmetric generic black hole. A particle experiences the action of a force of unspecified nature. We require the force to remain finite in a comoving frame. We show that the polar component of the four-velocity remains finite. As a result, the scenarios of high-energy particle collisions, found previously in the context of the BSW effect for equatorial motion, do not change qualitatively in the nonequatorial case.

## 7. Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Constraints from the generalized   parton distributions (GPDs)

**Authors:** The MMGPDs Collaboration, Muhammad Goharipour, Anoushiravan Moradi, K. Azizi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291v1)

**Summary:**

The Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of gravity modifies general relativity in high-density regimes. It offers an alternative framework that avoids cosmological singularities and remodels gravitational dynamics within compact objects. An important feature of EiBI gravity is its additional parameter, $\kappa$, which governs deviations from standard gravitational behavior. In this study, we investigate constraints on $kappa$ using the internal pressure distribution of the proton, derived from gravitational form factor (GFF)

## 8. Quantum Entanglement Theory and Its Generic Searches in High Energy   Physics

**Authors:** Junle Pei, Yaquan Fang, Lina Wu, Da Xu, Mustapha Biyabi, Tianjun Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09280v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a new formalism for quantum entanglement (QE), and study its generic searches at the colliders. For a general quantum system with $N$ particles, we show that the quantum space (the total spin polarization parameter space) is complex projective space. We establish key criteria for QE by calculating the exact quantum ranges and classical ranges, which can be used to detect QE at collider. These results establish model-independent methodologies for probing QE across collider experiments.

## 9. The exact WKB for dynamical and geometric exponents in generalized and   non-linear Landau-Zener transitions

**Authors:** Tomohiro Matsuda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09240v1)

**Summary:**

The exact WKB is a mathematical method that treats perturbative expansion with respect to the Planck constant as a singular perturbation. This method, initiated by Voros, is a powerful computational tool that can replace conventional approximations with exact results. Using the exact W KB, we analyze the derivation of the dynamical and the geometric exponents in generalized Landau-Zener models. We highlight the differences from the other calculational methods, highlighting the differences between them.

## 10. A localising AdS$_3$ sigma model

**Authors:** Lorenz Eberhardt, Matthias R. Gaberdiel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09226v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09226v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a CFT with symmetry at the `tensionless' point $k=3$ We establish the consistency of the theory by explicitly deriving the four-point function from the three-point data. The main motivation for our construction comes from holography. We show that various simple supersymmetric holographic dualities can be constructed by replacing the $AdS_3$ factor on the worldsheet with this alternative theory. However, our analysis does not require supersymmetry and also applies to bosonic backgrounds.

## 11. Exotic Encounters: Buchdahl's Conditions and Physical Black Holes

**Authors:** Ioannis Soranidis, Daniel R. Terno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09189v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09189v1)

**Summary:**

Physical black holes are light-trapping regions that form in finite time as seen by a distant observer. We show that these configurations necessarily violate at least two of Buchdahl's four original conditions, and the post-formation state violates them all. These violations are substantial: they include the null energy condition, non-monotonic energy profiles, and strong pressure anisotropies. Thus, the requirement of truly forming a horizon places physical black holes in a class of solutions that are more exotic than exotic compact objects.

## 12. Island rules for the noncommutative black hole

**Authors:** Yipeng Liu, Wei Xu, Baocheng Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09157v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of noncommutative black holes, we reconsider the island rule and reproduce the Page curve. When cutoff surface is far from event horizon, we find that the existence of islands helps to improve the radiation entropy and avoid its divergence at the late stage. The radiation entropy for the commutativeBlack hole with islands is still divergent in this case. It is interesting to obtain a significantly delay Page time for the noncommUTative case, allowing us to avoid considering islands for a sufficiently long period of time.

## 13. Magnetized Letelier black hole in AdS spacetime

**Authors:** Ahmad Al-Badawi, Faizuddin Ahmed, İzzet Sakallı, Sanjar Shaymatov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156v1)

**Summary:**

The study looked at the motion of charged, neutral, and light-like particles in a magnetized black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background. We demonstrate that key parameters characterizing the geometry-such as the cloud ofstrings parameter, the magnetic field strength, and the AdS radius-significantly affect the trajectories of these particles. These findings provide potential observables for distinguishing between different black hole models in realistic astrophysical environments.

## 14. Manifestly Covariant Canonical Formalism of Quadratic Gravity

**Authors:** Ichiro Oda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09149v1)

**Summary:**

We present the manifestly covariant quantization of quadratic gravity or higher-derivative gravity in the de Donder gauge condition. We explicitly calculate various equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs) and show that they are identically vanishing. We also clarify global symmetries, the physical content of quadRatic gravity, and clearly show that this theory is not unitary and has a massive scalar, massive ghost and massless graviton as physical modes. Finally, we comment on confinement of the massive ghost, thereby recovering the unitarity of the physical S-matrix.

## 15. Non-equilibrium scalar fields at finite temperature and density

**Authors:** Sebastian Mendizabal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09104v1)

**Summary:**

We study propagators in bosonic field theories at finite temperature and chemical potential using the Schwinger-Keldysh real-time formalism. The chemical potential, associated with conserved charges, modifies the structure of the propagators and introduces features that require detailed analysis. This work provides a basis for understanding the behavior of bosonic fields in thermal and dense environments. We focus on how a finite chemical potential affects the analytic Structure of the bosonic propagators, including changes in the position of poles and structure of branch cuts.

## 16. Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity   violation

**Authors:** Indranil Chakraborty, Susmita Jana, S. Shankaranarayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity. It can also be used to amplify polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity.

## 17. Charmed Meson Structure across Crossover from SU(4) Polyakov Quark Meson   Model with Isospin Asymmetry

**Authors:** Abdel Magied Diab

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09086v1)

**Summary:**

The Polyakov Quark Meson (PQM) model is extended to SU(4) flavor symmetry by incorporating the charm quark and introducing a finite isospin asymmetry. This model incorporates the light, strange, and charm chiral condensates, along with the Polyakov-loop variables, to describe the confinement--deconfinement phase transition in a thermal and dense QCD medium. Fluctuations of quark flavors, conserved charges and baryon-charm correlations are studied across a wide temperature range.

## 18. Dictionary revision for mapping boundary data to bound states

**Authors:** Jiliang Jing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09052v1)

**Summary:**

The correspondence between gravitational observables derived from scattering processes and adiabatic invariants in bound orbits has garnered significant attention in the study of bound orbital systems. The existing dictionary for this correspondence produces complex-valued quantities of bound orbits that contravene physical principles in 4PM calculations. We propose a rigorous modification by employing Hawking's method for black hole radiation. We also evaluate the new dictionary by comparing the binding energy calculated using effective one-body (EOB) theory with numerical relativity (NR) simulations data.

## 19. Extreme Compactness, Extreme Gravity: Higher-Derivative Corrections to   ECOs

**Authors:** Madhur Mehta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09049v1)

**Summary:**

Higher-derivative gravity theories offer insights into the behavior of extremely compact objects (ECOs) We focus on Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss- Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. We demonstrate how higher-curvature corrections lead to deviations from the standard ECO compactness scale. Observational constraints suggest these effects could be significant in certain astrophysical systems, providing a new perspective on the nature ofextremely compact objects in models of modified gravity.
