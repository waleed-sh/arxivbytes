## 0. Uniqueness of electrically and magnetically charged phantom wormholes

**Authors:** Marek Rogatko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15174v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the uniqueness theorem for static spherically symmetric traversable wormholes with two asymptotically flat ends. The key role in the proof is bounded with conformal positive energy theorem. For the completeness of the results, we also consider the case of phantom U(1)- gauge field. We conclude that we have found the solutions of the Einstein-phantom-electric-magnetic equations of motion for the wormhole case. The proof is based on the theory of quantum entanglement.

## 1. Wigner multiplets in QFT: from Wigner degeneracy to Elko fields

**Authors:** Cheng-Yang Lee, Ruifeng Leng, Siyi Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15116v1)

**Summary:**

We establish the theoretical foundation of the Wigner superposition field for spin-1/2 fermions. By imposing the Lorentz covariance, causality, and canonical quantization, we derive nontrivial constraints on the field configuration. This work lays the foundation for a systematic reformulation of Elko interactions and its phenomenology as a viable component of DM. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of El Ko as a dark matter (DM) candidate for dark matter.

## 2. Note on Type $III_1$ Algebras in $ c= 1$ String Theory and Bulk Causal   Diamonds

**Authors:** T. Banks

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15076v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that the Leutheusser-Liu procedure of isolating a von Neumann algebra in the $N = \infty$ limit of string theories, leads to the algebra of relativistic fermion fields on a half line for the $c = 1$ string theory. This model is well known to be integrable and have no black hole excitations. We have speculated that adding an interaction invisible in perturbation theory to a large finite number, $M$ of copies of the model, produces a non-integrable model.

## 3. Effective Starobinsky pre-inflation

**Authors:** Hardik Jitendra Kuralkar, Sukanta Panda, Archit Vidyarthi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15061v1)

**Summary:**

We find higher-derivative instabilities that are shown to decay into scalarons and causing an effective kinetic-domination stage where the universe behaves as a stiff fluid. Through slow cosmological expansion, the kination stage leads to inflation. We find a natural cut-off for the scalaron magnitude ensuring positivity of the modified kinetic term which matches Planck constraints on inflaton energy density at the pivot scale. Even for arbitrary initial conditions, kination naturally leads to the inflationary epoch without the need for fine-tuning.

## 4. Solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in external Yang-Mills gauge field

**Authors:** V. V. Parazian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14953v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14953v1)

**Summary:**

Exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in an external non-Abelian gauge field with an SU(N) symmetry group have been obtained. The external field is a solution of the Yang-Mills equations and describes a plane wave on the light cone. The obtained solutions form a complete set and can be used in the procedure of canonical quantization of scalar fields.

## 5. Quantum Curves in the Context of Symplectic Duality

**Authors:** Alexander Hock, Sergey Shadrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14924v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss how to use the recent progress in understanding of the $x$-$y$ duality and symplectic duality in the theory of topological recursion. The paper also contains an overview of recent generalizations of the setup of topology recursion prompted by the progress in understand the $X$-$Y$ dualy. We use these generalizations in order to efficiently compute the quantum spectral curve operators for the wave functions with arbitrary base points. We conclude with a discussion of some of the recent developments in the field of quantum spectral curves.

## 6. Geometry of Kinematic Flow

**Authors:** Daniel Baumann, Harry Goodhew, Austin Joyce, Hayden Lee, Guilherme L. Pimentel, Tom Westerdijk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14890v1)

**Summary:**

We uncover a geometric organization of the differential equations for the wavefunction coefficients of   conformally coupled scalars in power-law cosmologies. To do this, we introduce a basis of functions inspired by a decomposition of the wave function into time-ordered components. Representing these basis   functions and their singularities by graph tubings, we show that a remarkably simple rule for the merger   of tubes produces the equations for arbitrary tree graphs. The merger of tubes is shown to reflect the causal properties of bulk physics.
