## 0. Kinematic Stratifications

**Authors:** Veronica Calvo Cortes, Hadleigh Frost, Bernd Sturmfels

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09571v1)

**Summary:**

We study stratifications of regions in the space of symmetric matrices. Their points are Mandelstam matrices for momentum vectors in particle physics. Kinematic strata in these regions are indexed by signs and rank two matroids. Matroid strata of Lorentzian quadratic forms arise when all signs are non-negative. We characterize the posets of strata, for massless and massive particles, with and without momentum conservation. The results are published in the Journal of Physics.

## 1. Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system at integer index $k$:   polynomial algebras of integrals

**Authors:** Juan Carlos LÃ³pez Vieyra, Alexander V Turbiner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09502v1)

**Summary:**

An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces.

## 2. Gravity induced CP violation in mesons mixing, decay and interference   experiments

**Authors:** Jean-Marcel Rax

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09465v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09465v1)

**Summary:**

The impact of earth's gravity on neutral mesons dynamics is analyzed. The main effect of a Newtonian potential is to couple the strangeness and bottomness oscillations with the quark zitterbewegung oscillations. This coupling is responsible for the observed CP violation in the three types of experiments analyzed here. The amplitude of the violation is linear with respect to the strength of gravity so that this new mechanism allows to consider matter dominated cosmological evolutions providing the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.

## 3. Beta-Functions and RG flows for Holographic QCD with Heavy and Light   Quarks: Isotropic case

**Authors:** Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Ali Hajilou, Pavel Slepov, Marina Usova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09444v1)

**Summary:**

In a previous paper [arXiv:2402.14512v3], we investigated the dependence of the running coupling constant on temperature and chemical potential for holographic models of the light and heavy quarks, supported by an Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell action. We consider different types of boundary conditions for the dilaton. Only one of the possible boundary conditions yields results that agree with lattice calculations at zero chemical potential. We also show that the RG fluxes are invariant with respect to the choice of the boundary conditions.

## 4. Scalar Quasinormal Modes of Rotating Regular Black Holes

**Authors:** Fech Scen Khoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09390v1)

**Summary:**

Quasinormal modes are characteristic signatures of compact objects. For particularly low scaled Hawking temperatures, the dependence of the modes changes as rotation increases. A further investigation shows that the real part of the fundamental and first excited modes of the static and slowly rotating black holes (about $13\%$ of the extremal angular momentum) progresses in an opposite behavior in this low temperature region. The calculations are done using a spectral decomposition method. The scalar modes smoothly connect to the Kerr limit. They represent rotating generalizations of the Simpson and Visser metric.

## 5. Freelance Holography, Part II: Moving Boundary in Gauge/Gravity   Correspondence

**Authors:** A. Parvizi, M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari, V. Taghiloo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09372v1)

**Summary:**

We continue developing the freelance holography program. The gravity side is formulated on a space bounded by a generic timelike codimension-one surface inside AdS. arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed on the gravity fields on the surface. Our analysis is performed within the Covariant Phase Space Formalism (CPSF). We discuss how a given boundary condition on the bulk fields on a generic boundary evolves as we move the boundary to another boundary in AdS and work out how this evolution is encoded in deformations of the holographic boundary theory.

## 6. Freelance Holography, Part I: Setting Boundary Conditions Free in   Gauge/Gravity Correspondence

**Authors:** A. Parvizi, M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari, V. Taghiloo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09371v1)

**Summary:**

We explore AdS/CFT duality in the large $N$ limit, where the duality reduces to gauge/gravity correspondence. We show that $W$-freedom is associated with the choice of boundary conditions and slicing of solution space in the gravity side. We utilize these results to systematically formulate freelance holography in which boundary conditions of the fields on thegravity side are chosen freely and are not limited to Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss some examples with different boundary conditions for different fields.

## 7. On non-planar ABJM anomalous dimensions from M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times   S^{7}/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$

**Authors:** Matteo Beccaria, Stefan A. Kurlyand, Arkady A. Tseytlin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09360v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09360v1)

**Summary:**

Planar parts of conformal dimensions of primary operators in ABJM theory are controlled by integrability. Strong coupling asymptotics of planar dimensions of operators with large spins can be found from the energy of semiclassical strings. computing non-planar corrections requires understanding higher genus string corrections. Here we consider two more non-trivial examples of 1-loop M2 brane computations that correspond to long folded string with large spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ and orbital momentum $J$ in CP$^3.

## 8. Holographic Einstein Rings of AdS black holes with higher derivative   corrections in presence of string cloud

**Authors:** Abhishek Baruah, Bidyut Hazarika, Prabwal Phukon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09268v1)

**Summary:**

This paper seeks to explore the holographic optical appearance of an AdS black hole with higher derivative corrections in the presence of a string cloud. We introduce a Gaussian wave source that oscillates at the AdS boundary and propagates through the bulk. The resulting response function is then analyzed using an imaging system to study the optical properties of the black hole. Depending on the observer's position, the resulting holographic image takes on different forms, including a well defined Einstein ring, deformed luminous patterns, or isolated bright spots.

## 9. The Weak Gravity Conjecture in the Vilkovisky-DeWitt Effective Action of   Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** Tommaso Antonelli, Xavier Calmet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09227v1)

**Summary:**

The Weak Gravity Conjecture states that in any consistent theory of quantum gravity, the repulsive force mediated by a U(1) gauge field must be stronger than the attractive force of gravity. We find that depending on the values of the Wilson coefficients of the effective action, some UV complete theories will fulfill the conjecture, while others will not. We calculate quantum gravitational corrections to the charge-to-mass ratio of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, using the Vilkovisky-deWitt unique effective action approach.

## 10. Symmetry-Resolved Entanglement Entropy in Higher Dimensions

**Authors:** Yuanzhu Huang, Yang Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09070v1)

**Summary:**

We present a method to compute the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of spherical regions in higher-dimensional conformal field theories. Using asymptotic analysis techniques, we prove this expansion structure and the equipartition property in arbitrary dimensions. For large hyperbolic space volume, our results reveal a universal expansion structure of symmetry- Resolved EntanglementEntanglement Entanglements. This method is demonstrated through computations in both free field theories and holographic field theory.
