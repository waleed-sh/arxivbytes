## 0. Quasi-topological fractons: a 3D dipolar gauge theory

**Authors:** Erica Bertolini, Alberto Blasi, Nicola Maggiore

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01944v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the theory of a generic rank-2 tensor field in three spacetime dimensions. Despite the fact that the theory is not topological, the energy-momentum tensor vanishes on-shell, which justifies the quasi-topological appellation we give to this theory. We find an interesting physical interpretation, which consists in a generalized planar electromagnetism and in the emergence of two vector charges with restricted mobility. These are typical fractonic behaviours which can be related to the so called traceless scalar and vector charge theories.

## 1. LINE: Loop Integrals Numerical Evaluation

**Authors:** Renato Maria Prisco, Jonathan Ronca, Francesco Tramontano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01943v1)

**Summary:**

We present methods for the numerical evaluation of the master integrals that appear in the calculation of scattering amplitudes at higher order in perturbative quantum field theory. We follow the general strategy of solving first-order ordinary differential equations through series expansion. We have collected these procedures in an open source computer program that we dub \Line{}. Boundary conditions can be provided by the user or computed internally using the method of expansion by regions. Illustrative examples are also given in the paper..

## 2. Constraining the Gravitational Wave Speed in the Early Universe via   Gravitational Cherenkov Radiation

**Authors:** Paola C. M. Delgado, Alexander Ganz, Chunshan Lin, Roxane Thériault

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01910v1)

**Summary:**

 Scalar particles traveling faster than a subluminal gravitational wave generate gravitons via gravitational Cherenkov radiation. We find that for the minimal model, where only the speed of gravitational waves is modified, the relic graviton background can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, but still agrees with the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound in most cases. By requiring the relic Graviton background to remain consistent with the BBN constraint, we derive limits on the gravitational wave speed at early times.

## 3. The geometry of hypermultiplets

**Authors:** Stefan Vandoren

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01900v1)

**Summary:**

This is a light and short review on the geometry of hypermultiplets coupled to supergravity. The target space of the hypermultiplet sigma-model is a quaternion-K\"ahler (QK) manifold of negative scalar curvature. We review some aspects of hyper Multiplet moduli spaces, but also study aspects of QK-geometries in relation to the swampland, including some concrete examples of swam Pland QKmanifolds.

## 4. The ordered phase of charged N=4 SYM plasma

**Authors:** Alex Buchel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01856v1)

**Summary:**

 Yang-Mills plasma with diagonal $U(1)$ $R$-charge chemical potential is unstable at $T\gg \mu$ We construct a new homogeneous and isotropic phase of this plasma that dominates in the microcanonical ensemble (but not in the grand canonical one) The new phase extends to arbitrary high temperatures, and is characterized by an expectation value of a dimension-2 operator. In the limit, this ordered phase has vanishing energy density and is a low entropy density state.

## 5. Complete function space for planar two-loop six-particle scattering   amplitudes

**Authors:** Johannes Henn, Antonela Matijašića, Julian Miczajka, Tiziano Peraro, Yingxuan Xu, Yang Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01847v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01847v1)

**Summary:**

We derive the full system of canonical differential equations for all planar two-loop massless six-particle master integrals, and determine analytically the boundary conditions. This fully specifies the solutions, which may be written as Chen iterated integrals. We argue that this is sufficient information for evaluating any scattering amplitude in four dimensions up to the finite part. We provide a numerical implementation that evaluates the integrals in part of the Euclidean region, and validate this against numerical evaluation of the Feynman Integrals.

## 6. Stueckelberg field and Cosmology

**Authors:** T R Govindarajan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01756v1)

**Summary:**

Stueckelberg introduced an axion like scalar field to provide mass to the gauge electromagnetic field without breaking gauge invariance. This can be considered as a precursor to the spontaneously broken abelian Higgs model. We will consider its role in cosmology to provide a novel candidate to the dark matter question. In addition its implications to deeper issues will be pointed out. We hope this article has helped you understand some of the implications of this article.

## 7. Scrambling in charged hairy black holes and the Kasner interior

**Authors:** Hadyan Luthfan Prihadi, Donny Dwiputra, Fitria Khairunnisa, Freddy Permana Zen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01680v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar coupling constant, and charge density from Maxwell field affect the chaotic feature of a charged hairy black hole. Due to relevant deformation in the boundary theory, the bulk solution flows into more general Kasner spacetime in the interior of the black hole, near the singularity. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and calculate the out-of-time-ordered correlators holographically, which can probe chaos.

## 8. Fermionic Casimir effect at finite temperature in Horava-Lifshitz   theories

**Authors:** Andrea Erdas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01624v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, I study the finite temperature Casimir effect due to a massless fermion field that violates Lorentz invariance according to the Horava-Lifshitz theory. I carry out this study using the generalized zeta function technique that enables me to obtain the Helmholtz free energy and Casimir pressure when the Casimir plates are in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir at finite temperature. In all scenarios studied, I obtain simple and accurate analytic expressions of the free energy.

## 9. More on unconstrained descriptions of Higher Spin Massless Particles

**Authors:** R. Schimidt Bittencourt, D. Dalmazi, E. L. Mendonça

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01596v1)

**Summary:**

We suggest a new local action describing arbitrary integer spin-$s$ massless particles in terms of only two symmetric fields. It is an unconstrained version of the Fronsdal theory where the double traceless constraint on the physical field is evaded via a rank-$(s-4)$ Weyl like symmetry. We also show that the elimination of $\alpha$ after the Weyl gauge fixing leads to a non local diffeomorphism invariant action previously obtained in the literature.
