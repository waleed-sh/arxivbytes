## 0. Higgsing Transitions from Topological Field Theory & Non-Invertible   Symmetry in Chern-Simons Matter Theories

**Authors:** Clay Cordova, Diego García-Sepúlveda, Kantaro Ohmori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03614v1)

**Summary:**

Non-invertible one-form symmetries are naturally realized in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. We consider whether gapless systems can exhibit similar symmetry structures. We discuss theories with $Spin(2N)$ and $E_{7}$ gauge groups manifesting other patterns of non-inverted one- form symmetry. In many of our examples, the non-Invertible One-form symmetry is not a modular invariant TQFT on its own and thus is an intrinsic part of the fixed-point dynamics.

## 1. Observation of Temperature Effects in False Vacuum Decay

**Authors:** Riccardo Cominotti, Cosetta Baroni, Chiara Rogora, Diego Andreoni, Giacomo Guarda, Giacomo Lamporesi, Gabriele Ferrari, Alessandro Zenesini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03528v1)

**Summary:**

Metastability is a phenomenon encountered in many different physical systems. The decay timescale from a metastable to a stable state is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for thefalse vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties.

## 2. Baryogenesis from cosmological CP breaking

**Authors:** Mateusz Duch, Alessandro Strumia, Arsenii Titov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03506v1)

**Summary:**

During the big bang, this scalar may reach a CP-violating minimum. Such dynamics can emerge in theories featuring either a spontaneously broken local U(1) symmetry or modular invariance. The latter arises naturally as the effective field theory capturing the geometric origin of CP violation in toroidal string compactifications. Modular baryogenesis is compatible with the modular approach to resolving the strong CP problem. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time (AS&T)

## 3. Generalized entropic dark energy with spatial curvature

**Authors:** Sergei D. Odintsov, Simone D'Onofrio, Tanmoy Paul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03470v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a dark energy (DE) model from 4-parameter generalized entropy of apparent horizon in a spatially non-flat universe. The scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $Lambda$CDM model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of the present Hubble parameter leading to a possible resolution of the Hubble tension issue. This in turn leads to a positive spatial curvature of the the universe.

## 4. Reconciling the Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in   Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS Black Holes

**Authors:** Mohammad Reza Alipour, Saeed Noori Gashti, Behnam Pourhassan, İzzet Sakallı

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03453v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03453v1)

**Summary:**

The potential conflict between the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures (WCCC) poses a significant challenge in general relativity. This study investigates the reconciliation of the WGC and the WCCC by examining Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes in four-dimensional spacetime. The electromagnetic self-interaction parameter ($\mu) plays a crucial role in achieving this compatibility, says the study. It examines parameter spaces that satisfy both conjectures, ensuring event horizons and photon spheres while maintaining black hole properties.

## 5. Entanglement and local holography in quantum gravity

**Authors:** Gabriel Wong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03452v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03452v1)

**Summary:**

The It from Qubit paradigm proposes that gravitational spacetimes emerge from quantum entanglement. We argue that string theory provides the mechanism to define these entangled qubits in the bulk gravitating theory. This involves a local form of geometric transition, which is the stringy mechanism that underlies \emph{local} holography. We illustrate how this works in the A model topological string, and show how it works in a topologicalstring model, as well as in a non-topological string.

## 6. Tunneling with physics-informed RG flows in the anharmonic oscillator

**Authors:** Alfio Bonanno, Friederike Ihssen, Jan M. Pawlowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03437v1)

**Summary:**

We solve the anharmonic oscillator with physics-informed renormalisation group (PIRG) flows. We show that the instanton physics behind the exponential decay of the energy gap is already covered in the first order of the derivative expansion of the PIRG. The crucial new ingredients in the present analysis are the use of the ground state expansion within PirG flows, as well as precision numerics based on Galerkin methods. Our result for the decay constant is in quantitative agreement with the analytic one.

## 7. Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth

**Authors:** Oleksandr Gamayun, Murtaza Ali Mir, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Zoran Ristivojevic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03435v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03435v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficient that are consistent with the universal operators growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics.

## 8. Revisiting noncommutative spacetimes from the relative locality   principle

**Authors:** J. J. Relancio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03378v1)

**Summary:**

Relativistic deformed kinematics leads to a loss of the absolute locality of interactions. In this work, we present a characterization of the Poisson-Lie algebras formed by the noncommutative space-time coordinates of a multi-particle system. We show its connection with cotangent bundle geometries. The relativistic kinematic derived from these algebraes are also discussed. We conclude with a discussion of the role of relativism in the theory of particle interactions.

## 9. Loop corrections to the four-fermion interaction

**Authors:** A. T. Borlakov, D. I. Kazakov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03269v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the ff to ff scattering amplitudes for the a massless four-fermion interaction model in four dimensions. The loop corrections up to the three-loop level are calculated within the spin-helicity formalism using the Weyl spinors. We find out that there are two independent spinor structures that appear in all orders of perturbation theory that can be separated when calculating the diagrams. We left the derivation of these relations and further analysis of the consequences for another publication for the sake of clarity of the current presentation.

## 10. On Spinning Particles, their Partition Functions and Picture Changing   Operators

**Authors:** Eugenia Boffo, Pietro Antonio Grassi, Ondřej Hulík, Ivo Sachs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03231v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the partition function for the $N=1$ spinning particle. We show that it counts the dimension of the BRST cohomology in two- and four-dimensional target space. We find a consistent interaction as a derived bracket based on the associative product of world line fields, leading to an interacting theory of multiforms in space-time. We comment on the equivalence of the multiform theory with a Dirac fermion and identify the chiral anomaly of the latter with a Hodge anomaly.

## 11. Probing loop quantum effects through solar system experiments:   observational signatures and parameter constraints

**Authors:** Wen-Juan Ai, Ruo-Ting Chen, Jian-Pin Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03218v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03218v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity. The tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantumgravity effects. The study was published in the journal of The Astrophysics of Quantum Gravity (ASG) and is available on the ASG website.
