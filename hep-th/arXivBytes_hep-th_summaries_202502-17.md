## 0. Scalar weak gravity bound from full unitarity

**Authors:** Anna Tokareva, Yongjun Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10375v1)

**Summary:**

 weak gravity conjecture can be formulated as a statement that gravity must be the weakest force, compared to the other interactions in low energy effective field theory (EFT) The main difficulty for obtaining these constraints in the presence of gravity is related to the graviton pole which makes the required dispersion relations divergent in the forward limit. In this work, we present a new way of deriving the bound on the ratio between the EFT cutoff scale and Planck mass from confronting the IR divergences.

## 1. Microstates of AdS$_5$ black holes with hypermultiplets

**Authors:** Marina David, Annelien Vekemans

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10372v1)

**Summary:**

Theories are parametrized by a rational number $z$ which enters into the extremization equations making them more challenging to solve. We present a method to address these difficulties and highlight the subtleties involved. From the gravity perspective, we identify a charged, rotating black hole whose Bekenstein-Hawking entropy matches the prediction from the index for $z=\pm1. We discuss the thermodynamics and verify the near-horizon versions of the first law of thermodynamics.

## 2. Thermodynamics of integrable N=2 theories, squared

**Authors:** Xavier Kervyn, Davide Polvara, Alessandro Sfondrini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10356v1)

**Summary:**

A new supersymmetric integrable QFT was constructed from the relativistic limit of the worlsdheet theory of AdS$_3. The model is closely reminiscent of one previously considered by Fendley and Intriligator, though it enjoys twice as many supersymmetries. We formulate the string hypothesis for the Bethe--Yang equations, write down the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations, and simplify them in the form of a Y-system. We obtain three decoupled sectors associated with massive, massless-chiral andMassless-antichiral particles, for which we compute the UV central charge.

## 3. Non-Null Torus Knotted Gravitational Waves from Gravitoelectromagnetism

**Authors:** R. S. Facundo, I. V. Vancea

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10347v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we construct a non-null torus-knotted gravitational monochromatic wave solution of the linearized Einstein equations in vacuum. We employ the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) framework by analogy with classical electrodynamics. We investigate two properties inherent to this solution due to its GEM origin: the dual GEM potential and GEM helicity. We derive the line element, the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor and the geodesic equation for this background.

## 4. Hamiltonians to all Orders in Perturbation Theory and Higher Loop   Corrections in Single Field Inflation with PBHs Formation

**Authors:** Hassan Firouzjahi, Bahar Nikbakht

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10287v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the action and the interaction Hamiltonians to all orders in perturbation theory in the model of single field inflation with a transient ultra slow-roll phase. Employing the formalism of EFT of inflation, we obtain a compact non-perturbative expression for the interaction. Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field in the decoupling limit. We also present a non-linear relation between the curvature perturbations and the cosmological correlators and loop corrections.

## 5. Dissecting supergraviton six-point function with lightcone limits and   chiral algebra

**Authors:** Vasco Goncalves, Maria Nocchi, Xinan Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10269v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a bootstrap strategy to obtain the six-point function of supergravitons in $AdS_5\times S^5$ from symmetry constraints and consistency conditions. Compared to previous bootstrap algorithms, a novel feature is the use of lightcone OPEs together with the chiral algebra constraint. This makes it possible to isolate different parts of the correlator and fix them separately. Our strategy allows us to gain a refined understanding of the power of different bootstrap constraints, which is also useful for computing more general correlators.

## 6. Spacetime curvature corrections for the Yukawa potential and its   application for the Reissner-Nordström Metric

**Authors:** J. V. Zamperlini, C. C. Barros Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10247v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spacetime curvature on the Yukawa potential. Using the Bunch-Parker propagator expansion within Born's first approximation, we derive a Yukawa-like potential in a curved spacetime. We analyze the impact of the curvatures on the propagator in momentum space, revealing modifications to the potential and showing that the corrections are determined by geometric quantities from Einstein's equations, like the Ricci scalar and tensor. We illustrate this using the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, highlighting the corrections' magnitude for specific parameters.

## 7. Deep learning-based holography for T-linear resistivity

**Authors:** Byoungjoon Ahn, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Chang-Woo Ji, Keun-Young Kim, Kwan Yun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10245v1)

**Summary:**

We employ deep learning within holographic duality to investigate $T$-linear resistivity, a hallmark of strange metals. We also explore the impact of the resistivity slope on dilaton potentials. Our findings suggest that deep learning could help uncover mechanisms in holographic condensed matter systems and advance our understanding ofStrange metals. The research was published in the journal of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, New York City (PNAS) (http://www.pnas.org)

## 8. Supersymmetry and trace formulas III. Frenkel trace formula

**Authors:** Changha Choi, Leon A. Takhtajan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10210v1)

**Summary:**

We present two complementary approaches for the path integral derivation of the `non-chiral' trace formula for a semisimple compact Lie group $G$ The approaches closely follow the spirit of the Eskin trace formula and the Selberg trace formula. These methods provide a natural conceptual bridge between two seemingly independent derivations in \cite{Choi:2021yuz} and $G:2023pjn. We use the new supersymmetric localization principle introduced in the previous article.

## 9. A note on rank $\frac{3}{2}$ Liouville irregular block

**Authors:** Rubik Poghossian, Hasmik Poghosyan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10169v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10169v1)

**Summary:**

This paper focuses on a conformal block with rank $3/2$ which corresponds to the prepotential of the Argyres-Douglas theory in $\Omega$ background. We have verified that in small coupling regime our result is consistent with previously known expressions. Furthermore we derive the Deformed Seiberg-Witten curve which provides an alternative tool to explore above mentioned theory in Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of $Omega-background. We checked that the results are in complete agreement with the holomorphic anomaly approach.

## 10. Modeling of acceleration in heavy-ion collisions: occurrence of   temperature below the Unruh temperature

**Authors:** G. Yu. Prokhorov, D. A. Shohonov, O. V. Teryaev, N. S. Tsegelnik, V. I. Zakharov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10146v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10146v1)

**Summary:**

The acceleration of the medium is a direct analogue of the electric field in hydrodynamics. In contrast to an electric field, the Unruh effect is expected to be significant. The distribution exhibits a core-corona structure. For the confined phase the temperature is less than the UnRuh temperature. Conversely, in the deconfined phase, the relationship is inverse. The obtained results thus support the prediction about the existence of states with $T<T_U$ at the early stages of the collision.

## 11. C-parity, magnetic monopoles and higher frequency gravitational waves

**Authors:** Rinku Maji, Qaisar Shafi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10135v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to the left-right symmetric model. This breaking produces the topologically stable GUT monopole as well as a GUT scale C-string. The subsequent breaking at an intermediate scale of C-parity produces domain walls bounded by C-strings. We estimate the gravitational wave spectrum from these composite structures over a range of values of the domain wall tension $\sigma$. Depending on the value of $sigma$ the spectrum displays a peak in the higher frequency range between $10^2$ to $10#5$ Hz.

## 12. Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the   functional renormalization group

**Authors:** G. Fejos, D. Suenaga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134v1)

**Summary:**

The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.

## 13. Test fields and naked singularities: is the second law the cosmic   censor?

**Authors:** Si-Jiang Yang, Zheng-Quan Cui, Shao-Wen Wei, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10133v1)

**Summary:**

It has been claimed that a Kerr-Newman black hole can generically be overspun by neutral test fields. Even when backreactions are taken into account, the black hole could still be destroyed. In this paper, we revisit the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We show that a test scalar field and neutrino field near the event horizon can't overspin an extremal Kerr- newman. But they can overspin it if they violate the second law of black hole thermodynamics.

## 14. Planckian Bounds From Local Uncertainty Relations

**Authors:** Saurish Chakrabarty, Zohar Nussinov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10129v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce local uncertainty relations in thermal many-body systems. These lead to universal non-relativistic speed limits (independent of interaction range) and transport coefficient bounds that are compared against experimental data. We conclude that fundamental bounds in quantum systems can be derived from these relations. Back to Mail Online home.back to the page you came from.

## 15. Quantum Schwarzschild-(A)dS Black Holes: Unitarity and Singularity   Resolution

**Authors:** Steffen Gielen, Sofie Ried

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10104v1)

**Summary:**

In unimodular gravity the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant analogous to a total energy. We discuss self-adjoint extensions of the Schr\"odinger-like Hamiltonian arising from the requirement of unitarity. For semiclassical states we are able to derive analytical expressions for expectation values of the metric. This represents a quantum-corrected, nonsingular extension of the classical Schwarzschild-(A)dS geometry which describes a quantum transition between asymptotic black hole and white hole states.

## 16. Generalized Uncertainty Principle mimicking dynamical Dark Energy:   matter perturbations and gravitational wave data analysis

**Authors:** Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano, Yassine Sekhmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10043v1)

**Summary:**

The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) stands out as a nearly ubiquitous feature in quantum gravity modeling. We examine the growth of matter perturbations and structure formation employing the Top-Hat Spherical Collapse approach. Our analysis reveals that the profile of the density contrast is sensitive to the GUP parameter $\beta$, resulting in a slower gravitational evolution of primordial fluctuations in the matter density. We also discuss implications for the relic density of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying the parameter space that enhances the PGW spectrum.

## 17. Tensor condensate accompanied by chiral transition in a strong magnetic   field

**Authors:** Yuan-Hao Niu, Xin-Jian Wen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09996v1)

**Summary:**

The emergence of the tensor condensate is attributed to the four-fermion interaction. It is shown that a sufficiently large chemical potential is necessary for the occurrence of a phase transition towards tensor Condensate. We investigate the correlation between tensorCondensate and spin polarization, which accounts for the oscillatory behavior of the spin polarization during the transition from the chiral condenate to tensorcondensate phase. The study was published in the Journal of Theoretical Physics.

## 18. The information loss problem and Hawking radiation as tunneling

**Authors:** Baocheng Zhang, Christian Corda, Qing-yu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09924v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we review some methods that tried to solve the information loss problem. We revisit the solution based on Hawking radiation as tunneling, and provide a detailed statistical interpretation on the black hole entropy. In addition, we show that black hole evaporation is governed by a time-dependent Schrodinger equation that sends pure states into pure states rather than into mixed states. This is further confirmation of the fact that black Hole evporation is unitary. The paper is published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 19. Minimax surfaces and the holographic entropy cone

**Authors:** Brianna Grado-White, Guglielmo Grimaldi, Matthew Headrick, Veronika E. Hubeny

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09894v1)

**Summary:**

We study and prove properties of the minimax formulation of the HRT holographic entanglement entropy formula. The formula involves finding the maximal-area surface on a timelike hypersurface, or time-sheet. The minimax prescription suggests a way to construct a graph model for time-dependent states, a weighted graph on which min cuts compute HRT entropies. Our construction of a graphmodel relies on the time-sheets obeying a certain ``cooperating'' property, which we show holds in some examples.
