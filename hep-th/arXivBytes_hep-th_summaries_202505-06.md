## 0. Interacting massive/massless continuous-spin fields and integer-spin   fields

**Authors:** R. R. Metsaev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02817v1)

**Summary:**

Continuing-spin fields are considered by using the light-cone gauge vector superspace formulation. Cubic vertices for cross-interaction of massive/massless continuous spin fields are also derived. Map between the oscillator formulation and the vector supers space formulation of continuous-spin field is explicitly described. Equivalence of the light.cone gauge and Lorentz covariant formulations of continuous. spin field is also demonstrated. For the massive continuous- Spin fields of the principal and supplementary series and massless continuous- spin fields, all parity-even cubic vertices realized as functions on vectors superspace are obtained.

## 1. Entanglement between pair-created universes bridged by a wormhole and   its implications to big bang cosmology

**Authors:** Pisin Chen, Kuan-Nan Lin, Wei-Chen Lin, Dong-han Yeom

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02807v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a suitable global vacuum for the perturbations of the inflaton field in the Euclidean regime. This becomes a mixed state when restricted to one of the paired universes. This mixed state leads to an enhancement of the power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. In addition, entanglement between the two universes is realized by the existence of the wormhole. Thus, the power. spectrum enhancement in the long.wavelength regime might be evidence of our universe being created from a. wormhole that was entangled with a partner universe, and hence our universe. does not begin with a pure state.

## 2. The area and volume laws for entanglement of scalar fields in flat and   cosmological spacetimes

**Authors:** K. Andrzejewski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02778v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02778v1)

**Summary:**

In the Minkowski spacetime, the capacity of entanglement exhibits the area law for two kinds of geometries of the entangling surfaces: the sphere and strip. Next, we turn our attention to quenches. Namely, we analyse the dynamics of capacity; in particular, contribution of the volume and surface terms. We compare these results with theoretical predictions resulting from the quasiparticles model. In the second part, we consider the above issues for FLRW spaces; especially, for de Sitter space as well as a metric modeling the transition to radiation-dominated era.

## 3. Pomeron Evolution and Squeezed States in Quantum Optics

**Authors:** Dima Cheskis, Alex Prygarin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02684v1)

**Summary:**

Pomeron states are equivalent to pomeron fan diagrams at the leading order of perturbative expansion. We interpret the action of the displacement operator as pomerson propagation. We also interpret theaction of the squeeze operator aspomeron interaction. We apply the formalism of coherent states in quantum optics to pomegranate evolution. We show that evolving squeezed pomerons states are similar to pomersan fan diagrams. We conclude that pomeran states can be viewed as coherent states of quantum optics.

## 4. Gravitational dynamics of near-extreme Kerr (Anti-)de Sitter black holes

**Authors:** Francesca Mariani, Chiara Toldo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02674v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the thermodynamic response near extremality of black holes with angular momentum in (3+1)-dimensional de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We study the perturbations of the near horizon geometry at the level of the 4D metric, considering a consistent truncation for the metric fluctuations, and find solutions to the linearized Einstein equations. We show that their dynamics is governed by a Schwarzian theory and detail how the thermodynamics in 4D is reflected in near horizon dynamics.

## 5. $f(R,\mathcal{G})$-cosmological dynamics in the FLRW background

**Authors:** Nikolaos Dimakis, Alex Giacomini, Genly Leon, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Ekaterina Pozdeeva, Sergey Vernov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe.

## 6. Hydrodynamics of two-dimensional CFTs

**Authors:** Kevin Nguyen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02651v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate that the geometric action on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group appropriately describes non-dissipative two-dimensional conformal fluids. As a byproduct, our work sheds light on the nature of the AdS$_3$ reparametrization theory used to effectively compute Vir asoro vacuum blocks at large central charge. We use this to argue that the. geometric action manifestly controls both sides of the fluid/gravity correspondence, where the gravitational. `hologram' gives an effective hydrodynamical description of the dual CFT.

## 7. Evolving Dark Energy or Evolving Dark Matter?

**Authors:** Xingang Chen, Abraham Loeb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02645v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02645v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1<w<1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w<-1$, which violates the null energy condition. We show that this interpretation can be used to explain the origin of the universe.

## 8. Constraining the neutron star equation of state by including the   isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling using the Bayesian analysis

**Authors:** Deepak Kumar, Pradip Kumar Sahu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02618v1)

**Summary:**

We constrain the nuclear matter equation of state within the relativistic mean field model by including the isoscalar- vector and isovector- vector coupling term at a fundamental level using the Bayesian analysis. Our sets of equations of state produces neutron stars of mass larger than 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ to include the recent gravitational waves observation GW190419. All 20000 equations of states satisfy nuclear matter saturation properties at saturation densities and produces high mass neutron stars.

## 9. Quantum Cosmology Without Singularities: A New Approach

**Authors:** Valerian A. Yurov, Artyom V. Yurov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02616v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum gravity effects are modeled by the quantum potential method associated with the ''many interacting universes'' (MIU) model. The MIU quantization method might shed light on a number of other cosmological mysteries. It might account for a decoherence which preceded the eternal inflation, and elucidate how the quantum superposition of vacuum decays occurring at different places might give birth to actual bubble universes. The new method might help explain why our universe was born in an extremely low-entropy initial state required to trigger the initial inflation.

## 10. The five-twist identity for Feynman periods

**Authors:** Oliver Schnetz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02578v1)

**Summary:**

We prove a new identity for Feynman periods that acts on five-vertex cuts of completed primitive Feyn man graphs. It is shown that in $\phi^4$ theory this identity is independent from existing identities which are the twist, the Fourier identity and the Fouriers split. We show that this identity can be used to prove other identities in the same way as the twist and Fourier split. The identity can also be applied to other types of graphs, such as the graph-like graph and graph-shaped graph.

## 11. Mock modularity at work, or black holes in a forest

**Authors:** Sergei Alexandrov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02572v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02572v1)

**Summary:**

Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.

## 12. Landau-Ginzburg-Saito theory for descendant Gromov-Witten theory on   projective line

**Authors:** Vyacheslav Lysov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02556v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02556v1)

**Summary:**

The correlation functions for the descendants in the Landau-Ginzburg-Saito theory obey puncture, divisor, dilaton, and topological recursion relations. We prove that the LGS correlation functions of the mirror observables are equal to the GW invariants with descendants. We formulate the map between the descendant observables in the GW theory on the projective line and the descendant observable in the mirror LGS theory. We show that the correlation functions obey punctured and divisored relations.

## 13. Exponential improvement in quantum simulations of bosons

**Authors:** Masanori Hanada, Shunji Matsuura, Emanuele Mendicelli, Enrico Rinaldi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02553v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $ Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.

## 14. Analytical and numerical routes to strong coupling in $\mathcal{N}=2$   SCFTs

**Authors:** Pieter-Jan De Smet, Alessandro Pini, Paolo Vallarino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02525v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the quiver gauge theory arising from a Super Yang-Mills theory. We focus on two observables of this type: the correlators of $n$ coincident Wilson loops. We introduce an analytic method to evaluate the first terms of their strong coupling expansions. We also outline a numerical algorithm that serves as an independent check of the analytical results and provides predictions in cases where analytical techniques are currently not known. The results of this work are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 15. Smooth Splitting and Zeros from On-Shell Recursion

**Authors:** Callum R. T. Jones, Shruti Paranjape

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02520v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02520v1)

**Summary:**

We describe a new approach to understanding the origins of recently discovered "hidden zeros" and "smooth splitting" of tree-level amplitudes. We demonstrate that the mysterious splitting formulae follow from a simple contour integration argument in the style of on-shell recursion. The realizable 4d zeros are proven by a similar recursive argument based on BCFW and is found to generalize to a new class of intrinsically 4d "helicityZeros" present in all sectors of YM and also gravity.

## 16. Aspects of Geometrodynamics in the Jordan and Einstein Frames

**Authors:** Gabriele Gionti, S. J.

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02504v1)

**Summary:**

The Jordan and Einstein frames are connected through a Hamiltonian canonical transformation on the reduced phase space obtained by gauge fixing the lapse and the radial shift functions. We will discuss with particular care the problem of the boundary terms to be introduced in the general case of spherical symmetry. We introduce and discuss two static solutions (Fisher, Janis, Newman and Winicour solution in the Einstein frame and Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole Solution in the Jordan frame)

## 17. Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories

**Authors:** Alexey Golovnev, Kirill Russkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468v1)

**Summary:**

 path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the same level of the total Hamiltonian with the primary constraints only. The idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works, we argue. We conclude by saying that there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints.

## 18. Rephasing invariants of CP violation for heavy and light Majorana   neutrinos

**Authors:** Zhi-zhong Xing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02415v1)

**Summary:**

In the canonical seesaw mechanism, the strengths of charged-current interactions for light and heavy Majorana neutrinos are described respectively by the $3\times 3$ matrices $U$ and $R$ That are correlated with each other via the exact seesaw relation and the unitarity condition. We write out the Majorana-type invariants of CP violation of $R $ and $U$, which are insensitive to redefining the phases of three charged-lepton fields. We point out that similar rephasing invariants may also manifest themselves in a variety of lepton-flavor-violating processes.

## 19. Field Theory of Superconductor and Charged Vortex

**Authors:** Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, Hanwool Song

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02377v1)

**Summary:**

A Lagrangian of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair and a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism is proposed. We find static charged vortex solutions of finite energy. These charged vortices saturate the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound, that guarantees the nonperturbative classification of type I and II superconductors. It is proposed for an effective field theory of conventional superconductivity.

## 20. Smarr formula for black holes with primary and secondary scalar hair

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung, Theodoros Nakas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02368v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we revisit the thermodynamics of black holes endowed with primary and secondary scalar hair in the shift and beyond Horndeski gravity. We first demonstrate that the traditional thermodynamic approach fails to yield a consistent Smarr formula for both solutions under consideration. We then derive both the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Smarr Formula, offering a consistent thermodynamic description for scalar-hairy black holes. As an additional outcome, our analysis reveals a connection between the solutions withPrimary and secondary scalpar hair.

## 21. On Charged Black Holes in Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell Theory

**Authors:** Ze Li, Hai-Shan Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02340v1)

**Summary:**

The two charged black holes branch out from the bifurcation point of the neutral ones once charge is added. The RN-like black hole approaches the RN black hole as the charge increases. Since we consider the higher-derivative Weyl square term as part of the classical gravity theory, our result sets a lower bound on the charge-to-mass ratio in the context of the Weak Gravity Conjecture. The value is less than that of the extremal RN black Hole.

## 22. Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich and   complex-scaling regularizations

**Authors:** Okuto Morikawa, Shoya Ogawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02301v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact W KB methods in unstable quantum systems. We conclude by examining the inverted Rosen-Morse potential, which is used to examine resonant phenomena.
