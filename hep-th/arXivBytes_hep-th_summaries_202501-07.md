## 0. Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory

**Authors:** Francis Brown, Clément Dupont

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202v1)

**Summary:**

''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'' We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory. We prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes. We identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometry and their canonical forms.

## 1. Bell and Mermin inequalities in Quantum Field Theory from vacuum   projectors and Weyl operators

**Authors:** M. S. Guimaraes, I. Roditi, S. P. Sorella, A. F. Vieira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03186v1)

**Summary:**

The use of the vacuum projector $|0 \rangle \langle 0| enables us to construct a set of Hermitian dichotomic operators in relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski spacetime. Employing test functions supported in diamond regions, both Bell and Mermin inequalities are studied by means of a numerical setup. In addition to reporting expressive violations of both inequalities, the cluster property is also checked. The results are published in the book "Quantum Field Theory: Theory and Practice"

## 2. JT Gravity in de Sitter Space and Its Extensions

**Authors:** Indranil Dey, Kanhu Kishore Nanda, Akashdeep Roy, Sunil Kumar Sake, Sandip P. Trivedi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03148v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss and extend some aspects pertaining to the canonical quantisation of JT gravity in de Sitter space. We then extend this discussion to other two dimensional models obtained by changing the dilaton potential. Some discussion leading towards a path integral understanding for states, other than the Hartle Hawking state, is also included here, along with comments pertaining to Holography and the entropy of de Sitters space. It is hoped that this will lead to a more complete understanding of the nature of gravity.

## 3. Resurgence of the Tilted Cusp Anomalous Dimension

**Authors:** Gerald V. Dunne

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03105v1)

**Summary:**

We use resurgent extrapolation and continuation methods to extract detailed analytic information about the tilted cusp anomalous dimension. This enables accurate and smooth interpolation between the weak and strong coupling limits, and identifies the relevant singularities governing the finite radius of convergence of the weak coupling expansion. The input data is purely perturbative, generated from the BES equations, and these resurgent methods extract accurate non-perturbative information which matches the underlying physical structure. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics.

## 4. Stable excitations and holographic transportation in tensor networks of   critical spin chains

**Authors:** Zuo Wang, Liang He

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03084v1)

**Summary:**

The AdS/CFT correspondence offers a pathway to explore quantum gravity through tabletop experiments. Local bulk excitations (entitled "hologrons") manifesting attractive interactions given by AdS gravity were found. However, the fundamental question concerning the stability of these identified hologrons is still left open. Here, we address this question and find that hologrons are unstable during dynamic evolution. We find they can be constructed by the local primary operators in the boundary CFT. Furthermore, we identify a class of boundary excitations that exhibit the bizarre behavior of 'holographic transportation'

## 6. Bosonic M-Theory From a Kac-Moody Algebra Perspective

**Authors:** Keith Glennon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03000v1)

**Summary:**

We study the existence of a bosonic m-theory extension of the 10D and 26D closed bosonic string in terms of Kac-Moody algebras. We argue that K11 and K27 are symmetries which protect the coefficients of the closed bosonics string in 10 and 26 dimensions. We claim that in 11D, a non-trivial bosonic. m-Theory should be considered as (the bosonic sector of) m- theory, and in 27D that no obvious bosonicm-Theories exists.

## 7. Non-local modular flows across deformed null-cuts

**Authors:** Guan-Cheng Lu, Huajia Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02998v1)

**Summary:**

Modular flows probe important aspects of the entanglement structures, especially those of QFTs, in a dynamical framework. Despite the expected non-local nature in the general cases, the majority of explicitly understood examples feature local space-time trajectories under modular flows. The preservation of von-Neumann algebra under modular flow works in a subtle way for the non- local terms. We derive a differential-integral equation for the finite modular flow, which can be analyzed in perturbation theory.

## 8. Cosmological Perturbation Theory with Trinity of Scalar Fields

**Authors:** Amjad Ashoorioon, Shinji Mukohyama, Kazem Rezazadeh, Navid Talebizadeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02991v1)

**Summary:**

This paper explicitly develops the three-field cosmological perturbation theory with a flat field space. We solve the background andperturbation equations numerically for three different cases. The power spectra of the curvature perturbations in all cases are computed numerically, and the effects of rapid turn in the power spectrum are highlighted. We investigate an effective two-field model motivated by the two-block case of the multi-giant vacua matrix Inflation model. Then we investigate a completely three- field case without any direct interaction between different fields, and finally, a three-Field case containing direct interactions.

## 9. Yang-Mills Theory From Super Moduli Space

**Authors:** Carlo Alberto Cremonini, Ivo Sachs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02927v1)

**Summary:**

For the spinning superparticle we construct the pull-back of the world-line path integral to super moduli space in the Hamiltonian formulation. Algebraically, this gives a realization of the cyclic complex. The resulting space-time action is classically equivalent to Yang-Mills theory up to boundary terms and additional non-local interactions. We describe the underlying geometric decomposition of supermoduli space. It is the basis for the theory of superparticles and super-particles.

## 10. Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$

**Authors:** Carlo Heissenberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904v1)

**Summary:**

The contribution to the angular momentum loss for two-body scattering involving two radiation modes is determined by the radiation-reaction contribution. The latter is proportional to the tree-level one, and this reduces the calculation of $J_\text{2rad}$ to cut two-loop integrals. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J-2rad$ for generic velocities. This expression resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.

## 11. Revealing the internal magnetic field configuration of magnetars via   their associated periodic signals

**Authors:** Jie Shu, Quan Cheng, Xiao-Ping Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02887v1)

**Summary:**

The magnetic deformation of magnetars is affected by their internal magnetic fields. The periodicities of fast radio bursts (FRBs) 180916 and 121102 are interpreted as free precession of the (host) magnetars. Using these periodic signals, we investigate the magnetars' internal magnetic field. We could also constrain the critical temperature for neutron superfluidity in the neutron-star core considering that the former four magnetars are probably precessing, and the most stringent constraint is $T_{\rm c,core}<6.4\times10^8$ K.

## 12. Thermal RG Flow of AS Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** E. Nyergesy, I. G. Márián, E. Meskhi, Y. Turovtsi-Shiutev, I. Nandori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02878v1)

**Summary:**

We perform the thermal Renormalization Group (RG) study of the Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. Quantum effects are taken into account by moving along the thermal RG trajectory with fixed value of $tau$ producing the quantum effective action at a given dimensionless temperature. Only the symmetric phase of AS gravity survives at the high temperature limit ($\tau = \infty) which means that only the symmetrical phase survives at $k_T$

## 13. Multi-indexed Orthogonal Polynomials of a Discrete Variable and Exactly   Solvable Birth and Death Processes

**Authors:** Satoru Odake

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02877v1)

**Summary:**

We present the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable for 8 types. Based on them, exactly solvable continuous time birth and death processes are obtained. Their discrete time versions (Markov chains) are also obtained for finite types. The results are published in the open-access book, "Theory of Polynomial Analysis," published by Oxford University Press on November 14, 2013.

## 14. $η$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index

**Authors:** Shoto Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Mikio Furuta, Shinichiroh Matsuo, Tetsuya Onogi, Satoshi Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02873v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02873v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. We identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory. We prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operators.

## 15. Holographic inflation and holographic dark energy from entropy of the   anti-de Sitter black hole

**Authors:** Qihong Huang, He Huang, Bing Xu, Kaituo Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02759v1)

**Summary:**

A new holographic dark energy model has been proposed. When the Hubble horizon and particle horizon are chosen as the IR cutoff, the late-time accelerated expansion of universe is realized. We find that slow-roll inflation with the chaotic potential is favored by Planck results for some special cases, such as $n=1/3$ and $n =1/2. Our results indicate that when $b^{2}$ takes a small value, this model cannot be distinguished from the standard $Lambda$CDM model and can serve as an alternative.
