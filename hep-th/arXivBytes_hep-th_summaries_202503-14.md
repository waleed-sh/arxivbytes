## 0. Cosmological Dressing Rules

**Authors:** Chandramouli Chowdhury, Arthur Lipstein, Joe Marshall, Jiajie Mei, Ivo Sachs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10598v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10598v1)

**Summary:**

The basic observables in cosmology are known as in-in correlators. In this paper we explain how to make this property manifest by dressing flat space Feynman diagrams with certain auxiliary propagators. These dressing rules hold for any order in perturbation theory and can be derived for a broad range of scalar theories, including those with infrared divergences. In the latter case we show that they reproduce the same infrared Divergences predicted by the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism.

## 1. Compact Two-Loop QCD Corrections for $Vjj$ Production in Proton   Collisions

**Authors:** Giuseppe De Laurentis, Harald Ita, Ben Page, Vasily Sotnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10595v1)

**Summary:**

We show how the singular behavior of the rational functions can be systematically used to find a more compact basis of the space that they span. We apply our techniques to the $Vjj$ amplitudes, yielding a representation that is three orders of magnitude smaller than previous results. We then use these compact expressions to provide an efficient and stable C++ numerical implementation suitable for phenomenological applications. We present compact two-loop QCD corrections in the leading-color approximation for the production of an electroweak vector boson.

## 2. Chiral Magnetic Effect enhancement at lower collision energies

**Authors:** Sebastian Grieninger, Sergio Morales-Tejera, Pau G. Romeu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10593v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10593v1)

**Summary:**

We extend previous holographic studies of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) by incorporating a time-dependent magnetic field. We derive a quasi-equilibrium formula for the chiral magnetic effect in the expanding background that is valid at late times. Our results suggest that the CME signal is enhanced at collision energies below $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. We conclude that the integrated chiral current can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the collision energy.

## 3. Holographic study of shear viscosity and butterfly velocity for magnetic   field-driven quantum criticality

**Authors:** Jun-Kun Zhao, Li Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10584v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Our analysis reveals a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantumphase transition, and thus their derivatives can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.

## 4. A Simple Description of the Hyperkähler Structure of the Cotangent   Bundle of Projective Space via Quantization

**Authors:** Joshua Lackman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10570v1)

**Summary:**

Quantization identifies the cotangent bundle of projective space with the (non-Hermitian) rank-$1$ projections of a Hilbert space. We show that the quantization map is an isometric and complex embedding. Using this, we give a complete, simple and explicit description of the hyperk\"{a}hler structure. Our constructions are functorial, coordinate-free and reduction-free. We use this identification to study the natural geometric structures of these cotsangent bundles and those of Grassmanians.

## 5. Deep Learning based discovery of Integrable Systems

**Authors:** Shailesh Lal, Suvajit Majumder, Evgeny Sobko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10469v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10469v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.

## 6. Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants in the Solutions of   Einstein Equations

**Authors:** Leyla Ogurol, Bayram Tekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454v1)

**Summary:**

In Einstein's equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can in principle be measured is a non-trivial matter. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.

## 7. A search for sterile neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using   DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data

**Authors:** Lu Feng, Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423v1)

**Summary:**

Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to search for sterile neutrino. In this study, we utilized the latest baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, combined with the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the five-year supernova data. Our analysis indicates that the current data provide only a hint of the existence of massless sterile neut rinos (as dark radiation) at about the $1\sigma$ level.

## 8. No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary   dynamics

**Authors:** Akira Sone, Akram Touil, Kenji Maeda, Paola Cappellaro, Sebastian Deffner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. We prove that the unitary operation on the system's subspace uniquely determines the corresponding unitary operator on the environment's sub space. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations.

## 9. Does thermal leptogenesis in a canonical seesaw rely on initial memory?

**Authors:** Partha Kumar Paul, Narendra Sahu, Shashwat Sharma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10366v1)

**Summary:**

It is a common lore that in the thermal leptogenesis in the type-1 seesaw scenario with the conventional hierarchy of heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the CP violating, out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest RHN ($N_1$) is the only relevant source of $B-L$ asymmetry. In this paper, we examine this assumption comprehensively, considering decay and inverse decay processes as well as the inclusion of scatterings. We find that the above said assumption is true only if all the RHNs ($N 1, N_2$ and $N_3$) are in strong washout regime. To satisfy the neutrino masses and mixing given

## 10. The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings

**Authors:** Anastasios Avgoustidis, Edmund J. Copeland, Adam Moss, Juhan Raidal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361v1)

**Summary:**

We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings. We demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modeling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments.

## 11. Quantum Theory, Gravity and Higher Order Geometry

**Authors:** Folkert Kuipers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10348v1)

**Summary:**

The fact that quantum theory is non-differentiable, while general relativity is built on the assumption of differentiability sources an incompatibility between quantum theory and gravity. Higher order geometry addresses this issue directly by extending differential geometry. As this includes the path integral formulation of quantum theory, it provides a natural mathematical framework for describing the interplay between gravity and quantum theory. In this article, we review the motivation for and the basic features of this framework. We also point towards future developments in this area.

## 12. Model-independent $H_0$ within FLRW: Joint constraints from GWTC-3   standard sirens and strong lensing time delays

**Authors:** Ji-Yu Song, Jing-Zhao Qi, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346v1)

**Summary:**

The Hubble tension has emerged as a critical crisis in cosmology, with the cause remaining unclear. Determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$) independently of cosmological models and distance ladders will help resolve this crisis. In this letter, we for the first time use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong lensing system, RXJ1131-1231. We find that our results are still dominated by statistical errors, but we notice the great potential of using GW dark sirens to provide calibration.

## 13. Hydrogen Atom in a Fuzzy Spherical Cavity

**Authors:** Matej Hrmo, Samuel Kováčik, Patrik Rusnák, Juraj Tekel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10227v1)

**Summary:**

The model is motivated by studies of quantum space but can also be used to study standard physics. The main feature of the model is that functions in three-dimensional space are expressed in terms of Hermitian matrices of a certain form. Relevant equations are then matrix equations, and some problems can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem. We show how this simple approach can reproduce the results of other studies analyzing the hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity. We observe a set of solutions with no classical counterpart that has been described in a former theoretical study.

## 14. Phase transitions in a holographic s+d model from the 4D   Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity

**Authors:** Ting-Rui Liao, Xin Zhao, Hui Zeng, Zhang-Yu Nie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10223v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, the phase structure of a holographic s+d model with quartic potential terms from the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is studied in the probe limit. We first show the $q_d-\mu$ phase diagram with a very small value of the Gauss- Bonnet coefficient. After that we confirm the universality of the influence of the quartic term with coefficient $\lambda_d$ on the d-wave solutions, which is similar to the case of s-wave and p-wave solution previously studied in s+p model.

## 15. Basis light-front quantization for the $Λ_b$ and $Σ_b$   baryons

**Authors:** Lingdi Meng, Tian-Cai Peng, Zhi Hu, Siqi Xu, Jiangshan Lan, Chandan Mondal, Guo-Li Wang, Xingbo Zhao, James P. Vary

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10026v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the masses and light-front wave functions of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon and its isospin triplet counterparts. These wave functions are obtained as eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian, which incorporates the one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling and a three-dimensional confinement potential. Parton distribution functions (PDFs) of these baryons are obtained for the first time, with gluon and sea quark distributions dynamically generated through QCD evolution of valence quark PDFs.

## 16. $T\overline{T}$ Deformation: Introduction and Some Recent Advances

**Authors:** Song He, Yi Li, Hao Ouyang, Yuan Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997v1)

**Summary:**

This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $ T\bar T$-like deformation, including holographic entanglement and single-trace deformations. The paper examines the profound relationship between $T \bar {T} $ deformation and holographs, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holographY proposal.

## 17. Higher Form and Higher Group Symmetries via Mirror Symmetry

**Authors:** Jiahua Tian, Xin Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09967v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we uncover a connection that relates the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of 5D SCFTs derived from geometric engineering methods. Viewing defects as branes wrapping relative cycles in a non-compact CY3, we find that the defect groups can be read off from the VEVs of the corresponding line operators at the leading order. We recursively obtain closed-form expressions of instanton expansions of the V EV of Wilson lines of certain 5D theories.

## 18. More about quark Yukawa textures from selection rules without group   actions

**Authors:** Tatsuo Kobayashi, Yume Nishioka, Hajime Otsuka, Morimitsu Tanimoto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09966v1)

**Summary:**

We study the coupling selection rules associated with non-group symmetries. Some of them cannot be realized by a conventional group-like symmetry. They lead to interesting phenomenology such as a solution to the strong CP problem without axion. We clarify which Yukawa textures can be derived by our selection rules for $M=3, 4, and 5. We obtain various textures including the the nearest neighbor interaction type and its extension. We also show that some of them can be used to solve strong CP problems.

## 19. Integrability and Conformal Blocks for Surface Defects in   $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM

**Authors:** Adolfo Holguin, Hiroki Kawai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09944v1)

**Summary:**

We study various aspects of half-BPS surface defect operators in SYM. For defects on generic points on the moduli space we use superconformal symmetry to fix the form of one-point and two-point functions. We also investigate the integrability of the defect CFT in the planar limit and argue that the Integrability is broken at generic points of defect moduli. We provide evidence for this by showing that the defect one- point functions in this case can be mapped to a class of known integrable quenches.

## 20. Beyond the Boltzmann equation for weakly coupled quantum fields

**Authors:** Xu-Yao Hu, Vladimir Rosenhaus

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09932v1)

**Summary:**

We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. We derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density. We present our results in a paper published in the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 21. Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials:   Instabilities and other Questions

**Authors:** Michele Lenzi, Arnau Montava Agudo, Carlos F. Sopuerta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09918v1)

**Summary:**

Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties.
