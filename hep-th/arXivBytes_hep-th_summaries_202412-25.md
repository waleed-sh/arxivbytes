## 0. Crosscap Quenches and Entanglement Evolution

**Authors:** Zixia Wei, Yasushi Yoneta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18610v1)

**Summary:**

Quench dynamics starting from nonequilibrium states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. We propose a novel quench protocol to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of entanglement entropy. We study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic C FTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.

## 1. Lattice T-duality from non-invertible symmetries in quantum spin chains

**Authors:** Salvatore D. Pace, Arkya Chatterjee, Shu-Heng Shao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18606v1)

**Summary:**

In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality. This is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice. We find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent $z>1.

## 2. KP integrability of non-perturbative differentials

**Authors:** Alexander Alexandrov, Boris Bychkov, Petr Dunin-Barkowski, Maxim Kazarian, Sergey Shadrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18592v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the KP integrability of non-perturbative topological recursion, which can be considered as a formal $\hbar$-deformation of the Krichever construction. This property goes back to a 2011 conjecture of Borot and Eynard. We also show the KP integrability of the KP constitution, which is a formal deformation of the Krichevers construction. We conclude that the KP-constitution is inexplicable in the topological recursion.

## 3. The Neveu-Schwarz group and Schwarz's extended super Mumford form

**Authors:** Katherine A. Maxwell, Alexander A. Voronov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18585v1)

**Summary:**

In 1987, Albert Schwarz suggested a formula which extends the super Mumford form from the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces into the super Sato Grassmannian. His formula is a remarkably simple combination of super tau functions. We compute the Neveu-Schwarz action on super t Tau functions, and show that Schwarz's extended Mumfordform is invariant under the super Heisenberg-Neveu. action. This strengthens Schwarz's proposal that a locus within the grassmannian can serve as a universal moduliSpace with applications to superstring theory.

## 4. Toward the Universal Mumford form on Sato Grassmannians

**Authors:** Katherine A. Maxwell, Alexander A. Voronov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18570v1)

**Summary:**

The existence of this universal Mumford form furthers the proposal that the Sato Grassmannian provides a universal moduli space with applications to string theory. We construct a local universal super Mumfordform on a product of super Satograssmannians using the flow of the Neveu-Schwarz algebra. Our approach using the Virasoro flow is an alternative to using the KP flow, which in particular allows for a bosonic universal Momford form to be constructed. We claim that this approach can be used to construct a universal Mumfords.

## 5. Flowery Horizons & Bulk Observers: $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Drive in   $2d$ Holographic CFT

**Authors:** Jayashish Das, Arnab Kundu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536v1)

**Summary:**

We explore and analyze bulk geometric aspects corresponding to a driven two-dimensional holographic CFT. We demonstrate that starting with a thermal initial state, the evolution of the event horizon is characterized by distinct geometric transformations in the bulk. We also show that the explicit symmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure that displays a $U(1) \to {\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the $q\to \infty$ limit, the $U (1)$ symmetry is effectively restored.

## 6. The exact Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale-factor minisuperspace   model

**Authors:** Eftychios Kaimakkamis, Hervé Partouche, Karunava Sil, Nicolaos Toumbas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18532v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the classical minisuperspace model describing a closed, homogeneous and isotropic Universe, with a positive cosmological constant. Upon canonical quantization, the infinite number of possible operator orderings in the quantum Hamiltonian leads to distinct Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the wavefunction. Remarkably, all quantum predictions can be expressed through the combination of the two equations. This result demonstrates that all seemingly distinct quantum theories arising from different quantization schemes of the same classical model are fundamentally equivalent.

## 7. Systematic Constructions of Interfaces and Anomalous Boundaries for   Fermionic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases

**Authors:** Kevin Loo, Qing-Rui Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18528v1)

**Summary:**

We use the pullback trivialization technique to systematically construct gapped interfaces and anomalous boundaries for fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) states. These FSPT states may involve decoration layers of both Majorana chains and complex fermions. We derive general consistency formulas explicitly for (2+1)D and (3+1), where nontrivial twists arise from fermion symmetric local unitaries or "gauge transformations" that ensure coboundaries vanish at the cochain level.

## 8. Komar charge of N = 2 supergravity and its superspace generalization

**Authors:** Igor Bandos, Patrick Meessen, Tomás Ortín

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18510v1)

**Summary:**

We find the defining equations for a Killing vector and its superpartner. We use them to construct the generalized Komar superform of minimal N=2, d=4 supergravity. The superspace procedure presented here can be used for the construction of Komar forms in more general supergravity theories. We also present the (more cumbersome) calculation of the generalized. Komar 2-form used to prove the first law in the component formalism, as an independent confirmation of our main result.

## 9. Field-theoretic approach to flat polymerized membranes

**Authors:** Simon Metayer, Sofian Teber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18490v1)

**Summary:**

We review the field-theoretic renormalization-group approach to critical properties of flat polymerized membranes. Focusing on the critical flat phase of two-dimensional membranes we analyse the corresponding flow diagram and present the derivation of the anomalous stiffness. State-of-the-art four-loop results as well as discussions on the structure of the perturbative series and comparison with other approaches are also provided. We then provide a detailed account of the full three-loop computations of the model within the dimensional regularization scheme.

## 10. Large and small hierarchies from finite modular symmetries

**Authors:** Tetsutaro Higaki, Junichiro Kawamura, Tatsuo Kobayashi, Kaito Nasu, Riku Sakuma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18435v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18435v1)

**Summary:**

The radiative stabilization mechanism can stabilize the modulus of the finite modular symmetry. We study the stabilization of multiple moduli fields, so that various hierarchical values of the modular forms coexist in a model. For example, one modulus stabilized at $Im$ is responsible for the hierarchical structure of the quarks and leptons in the Standard Model, and another modulus can account for the flatness of the QCD axion. We show that the radiative corrections due to the moduli dependent vector-like masses are invariant under the modular symmetry.

## 11. Deforming the Double Liouville String

**Authors:** Gaston Giribet, Mauricio Leston, Pedro Schmied, Bruno Sivilotti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18411v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a generalization of the double Liouville theory, which can be thought of as a two-parameter family of marginal deformations of the so-called Virasoro Minimal String (VMS) We also discuss the analogous computation in the case of the ComplexLiouville String (CLS) theory. Both VMS and CLS theories have recently been studied in relation to many interesting models, including the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, matrix models, and de Sitter gravity in 2 and 3 dimensions.

## 12. The compactified D-brane cylinder amplitude and T duality

**Authors:** J. X. Lu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18388v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we address how to implement T duality to the closed string tree cylinder amplitude between a Dp brane and a D p brane with $p - p' = 2 \,n$. We then show explicitly how to perform a T dualy to this amplitude along either a longitudinal or a transverse compactified direction to both branes. In the decompactification limit, we show that either the compactified cylinder amplitude or the T dual compactified cylinders one gives the known non-compactified one as expected.

## 13. Nested Holography

**Authors:** Kostas Filippas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18366v1)

**Summary:**

The spin-orbit duality is a holographic map that projects a massive theory in four-dimensional flat spacetime onto the three-dimensional null infinity. The map is then realized on $N_f$ massive fermions in flat space which, indeed, are the hologram of $2N-f$ massless fermion on the cylinder. The AdS/CFT duality emerges into a larger context, where one holography nests inside the other, suggesting a complete holographic bridge between fields in flatspace and the AdS superstring.

## 14. Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver   Gauge Theories

**Authors:** Pujun Liu, Rui-Dong Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359v1)

**Summary:**

We check the consistency of connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman black hole.

## 15. Vortex shedding patterns in holographic superfluids at finite   temperature

**Authors:** Peng Yang, Shanquan Lan, Yu Tian, Yu-Kun Yan, Hongbao Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18320v1)

**Summary:**

The dynamics of superfluid systems exhibit significant similarities to their classical counterparts, particularly in the phenomenon of vortex shedding triggered by a moving obstacle. In such systems, the universal behavior of shedding patterns can be classified using the classical concept of the Reynolds number. Using a holographic model of finite-temperature superfluids, we investigate the vortex shedding patterns and identify two distinct regimes without quantum counterparts. We find that these behaviors are qualitatively similar to empirical observations in both classical and quantum counterparts, which imply the robustness of vortex shed dynamics at finite-time.

## 16. Noether Symmetry Analysis for Generalized Brans-Dicke Cosmology

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18311v1)

**Summary:**

We present the complete solution to the classification problem regarding the variational symmetries of the generalized Brans-Dicke cosmological model. Through the symmetry analysis, we were able to specify the functional form of the field equations such that they become integrable. Additionally, new families of Integrable Cosmological models are presented. We present the results in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Astronomical Society of the UK (PRAS) on November 14, 2013.

## 17. Modern Approach to 2D Conformal Field Theory

**Authors:** Yuya Kusuki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18307v1)

**Summary:**

The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, they cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. They will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as HHLL block and monodromy method.

## 18. Extended Near Horizon Symmetries of Extremal BTZ Black Holes in 3D   Massive Gravity

**Authors:** Debojyoti Ballav, Shailesh Kulkarni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18286v1)

**Summary:**

We study the asymptotic symmetries of near-horizon extremal BTZ black holes in higher derivative theories of gravity. By employing a particular boundary condition and the regularization prescription proposed earlier for the Einstein gravity, we demonstrate the existence of two centrally extended Virasoro algebras. The central charges evaluated within this framework are in agreement with their corresponding expressions evaluated at the spatial infinity. We also discuss the robustness of the regularized procedure by relating asymPTotic and near-Horizon geometries.

## 19. Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum   gravity II: A new solution without Cauchy horizons

**Authors:** Wentao Liu, Di Wu, Jieci Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18083v1)

**Summary:**

The third type of black hole is free of Cauchy horizons, and was only recently obtained. This solution can describe a black hole with an event horizon for certain parameter ranges, or a horizonless compact object beyond those ranges. We show that its light rings feature both stable and unstable branches, and that the black hole shadow size grows with the quantum parameter. This feature can serve as a hallmark of black holes in EQG, offering a potential way to distinguish them from their GR counterparts.
