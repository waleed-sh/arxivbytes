## 0. Cosmological Perturbations from a New Approach to Inflation

**Authors:** Brandon Melcher, Arnab Pradhan, Scott Watson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04669v1)

**Summary:**

In a previous paper we proposed a new approach to the beginning of inflation -- a lingering universe. The universe begins in a lingering state with a nearly vanishing Hubble parameter. This calls into question the absolute age of the universe, as the Hubble time can be nearly infinite. It also provides promise for addressing the initial singularity of inflation and issues with quantum field theory in de Sitter space-time. Such models arise in classical cosmologies with non-vanishing spatial curvature, and independently by models that arise in string cosmology.

## 1. Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model

**Authors:** Martí Berenguer, Javier Mas, Juan Santos-Suárez, Alfonso V. Ramallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04660v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation.

## 2. Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics without Amperes Law

**Authors:** Ruben Lier, Akash Jain, Jay Armas, Oliver Porth

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04638v1)

**Summary:**

 resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations, Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit. This poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnets based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.

## 3. Effective action for relativistic hydrodynamics from Crooks fluctuation   theorem

**Authors:** Nicki Mullins, Mauricio Hippert, Jorge Noronha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04637v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04637v1)

**Summary:**

A new effective theory framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics in the relativistic regime is derived. For the first time, we establish clear and concise conditions for ensuring that the resulting effective theories are causal, stable, and well-posed within general relativity. These properties are independent of spacetime foliation and are valid in the full nonlinear regime. Out-of-equilibrium fluctuations are constrained by a relativistically covariant version of Crooks fluctuation theorem, which determines how the entropy production is distributed even when the system is driven by an external force.

## 4. Lorentzian OPE Inversion Formula: A Geometric Perspective

**Authors:** Pulkit Agarwal, Richard Brower, Timothy Raben, Chung-I Tan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04621v1)

**Summary:**

We give a new perspective on the Lorentzian OPE inversion formula of arXiv:1703.00278. We introduce an auxiliary fourpoint function that can be related to the traditionally defined ones via a Radon transform. The Mellin amplitudes associated with this auxiliary function can be shown to be equivalent to the conventional partial wave amplitudes. This has the intuitive geometrical meaning of a generalization of the Projection-Slice Theorem. We conclude that the auxiliary function has the same effect as the traditional one.

## 5. Reflections of topological properties in the planar-Hall response for   semimetals carrying pseudospin-1 quantum numbers

**Authors:** Firdous Haidar, Ipsita Mandal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04498v1)

**Summary:**

We continue our investigations of the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar-Hall andPlanar-thermal Hall configurations. We consider here nodes hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles. Such systems exemplify multifold semimetals, as they have three bands crossing at a nodal point. We derive the explicit expressions of the electric, thermoelectric, and thermal coefficients, when the nodes are subjected to the combined influence of an electric field and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field.

## 6. Corrections to the Black hole entropy from a Bose Einstein condensate: a   semi-classical phenomenological approach

**Authors:** Stefano Viaggiu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy. Motivated by our recent proposal concerning the nature of the degrees of freedom. We show that after modifying the internal energy by means of simple by physically sound arguments dictated by ordinary quantum mechanics and possible non-commutative effects at Planckian scales. Our approach show that the possibility that the interior of a black hole is composed with a Bose Einstein condensate of gravitons is a viable physically motivated possibility.

## 7. The effective phase space and $e$-folding of the Starobinsky and   extended Starobinsky model of inflation

**Authors:** Theppawan Rukpakawong, Piyabut Burikham

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04334v1)

**Summary:**

Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky inflationary model show three apparent attractors; the fixed angle attractor in the large field limit, the final attractor representing reheating phase in the small field region, and the apparent attractor corresponding to the slow-roll condition connecting between the large-field and small-field region. To consider the total $e$-folding likelihood of the model, Remmen-Carroll conserved measure is constructed and normalized. Using the measure, the total e- folding number $N$ and its expectation value $N \right\rangle$ are calculated.

## 8. The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum   Field Theory

**Authors:** Takuya Morozumi, Tomoharu Tahara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04320v1)

**Summary:**

We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. The transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation. This method enables us to understand the time variation ofLepton number induced by chiral occurrences in terms of transition probabilities.

## 9. On the $θ$-angle physics of QCD under pressure: The strange and   isospin phase diagram

**Authors:** Jahmall Bersini, Alessandra D'Alise, Clelia Gambardella, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04261v1)

**Summary:**

We unveil the impact of the $\theta$-angle on the QCD phase diagram at nonzero isospin and strangeness chemical potentials. We establish the phase boundaries as well as the nature of the associated phase transitions. We discover a novel parity-preserving superfluid phase. We comment on Dashen's phenomenon in the superfluid phases when varying the number of light flavors. The order parameters and the physical spectrum in the different phases are determined. We further elucidate the physics around $\theta=\pi$

## 10. Duality of spin-2 and spin-3 models invariant under transverse   diffeomorphisms and the tensionless limit of string theory

**Authors:** R. Schimidt Bittencourt, D. Dalmazi, B. dos S. Martins, E. L. Mendonça

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04214v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate a general class of massless local theories of spin-2 and spin-3. We identify the ghost free region in their parameters space and show the relationship of those models with the tensionless limit of the open bosonic string field theory. An apparent mismatch between most of the TDiff models and the ``doublet'' action has led us to prove a nontrivial duality within the TDIFF models which restores the equivalence. In particular, they are all physically equivalent to their simplest version known as Maxwell-like models.
