## 0. A Non-linear Massive Gravity Theory of Geometric Origin

**Authors:** Thibault Damour, Tamanna Jain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13077v1)

**Summary:**

We study the number of propagating degrees of freedom, at non-linear order, in torsion gravity theories. We focus on a three-parameter subfamily of theories (``torsion bigravity") that contains, at linear order, only two physical excitations. We study the dynamics of the massive spin-2 field in the limit where the torsional field decouples from the metric. The number of degrees offreedom of the torion field is found to change, atNon-linear Order, from five to nine.

## 1. Creation of Wavepackets for Quantum Chromodynamics on Quantum Computers

**Authors:** Matteo Turco, Gonçalo M. Quinta, João Seixas, Yasser Omar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13069v1)

**Summary:**

One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time. The initial state of such simulation is made of two wavepackets moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is hard. Here we extend a previous work to create wavepacket of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in one and three dimensions, including QCD. The preparation is performed successfully with a certain success probability, which may represent the main obstacle of our approach.

## 2. Euclidean AdS wormholes and gravitational instantons in the   Einstein-Skyrme theory

**Authors:** Fabrizio Canfora, Cristóbal Corral, Borja Diez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13024v1)

**Summary:**

Euclidean AdS wormholes provide a natural setup for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence with multiple boundaries. However, they cannot be embedded in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Maxwell theory if these boundaries have positive curvature. Maldacena and Maoz showed that this obstruction could be circumvented by introducing merons in the 4D Einstein- AdS-Yang-Mills theory. Other topologically nontrivial ground states in Einstein-Skyrme theory are found.

## 3. Barrow entropies in black hole thermodynamics

**Authors:** Salvatore Capozziello, Mehdi Shokri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12987v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12987v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermodynamic features of static, spherically-symmetric Schwarzschild black holes. We consider a logarithmic-corrected type of this entropy by taking into account some loop quantum gravity effects. We investigate the black hole thermodynamics from the viewpoint of Barrow entropy in presence of non-extensivity effects coming from the Tsallis statistics. Finally, we compare the results obtained for different Barrow-based entropies. The study was published in the Journal of Black Hole Theory.

## 4. A note on Strong Cosmic Censorship and its violation in   Reissner-Nordström de Sitter black hole space-times

**Authors:** Anna Chrysostomou, Alan S. Cornell, Aldo Deandrea, Seong Chan Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12968v1)

**Summary:**

Penrose's Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture safeguards determinism in General Relativity. For the Kerr-Newman family of black hole solutions, this requires the inextendability of the metric past the Cauchy horizon. We study the consequent role of quasinormal mode behaviour and illustrate the parameter space for which we consistently observe violations of the conjecture within Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black holes. In this note, we review some of the arguments for and against the conjecture.

## 5. Complex hidden symmetries in real spacetime and their algebraic   structures

**Authors:** R. Vilela Mendes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12960v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12960v1)

**Summary:**

Real spacetime is a Lorentzian fiber in a complex manifold. There is a mismatch of the elementary linear representations of their symmetry groups. No spinors are allowed as linear irreducible representations for the complex case. When a spin$^{h}$ structure is implemented on the associated principal bundles, one is naturally led to an algebraic structure similar to the one of the standard model. This last (dynamical) structure might therefore be inherited from the kinematical symmetries of a larger space.

## 6. Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor/Quantum Hall Interfaces

**Authors:** Enderalp Yakaboylu, Thomas Schmidt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12908v1)

**Summary:**

We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a Chern insulator in the integer quantum Hall (QH) regime. Our results show that the effective interaction at this boundary gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons at the SC/QH interface. We demonstrate that vortex solutions at the interface carry a fractional charge of $e/2$, which reflects the ratio between the effective Chern-Simons level parameter and the charge of the Cooper pairs.

## 7. The late-time heating Green's function and improvements to distortion   frequency hierarchy treatment

**Authors:** Sara Evangelista, Jens Chluba, Francesco Pace

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12822v1)

**Summary:**

Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.

## 8. Comparison of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes in $f(\mathbb{T})$ and   $f(\mathbb{Q})$ Gravity

**Authors:** Zhen-Xiao Zhang, Chen Lan, Yan-Gang Miao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12800v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes in vacuum. Based on the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, the gravitational effects arise from non-metricity (the covariant derivative of metrics) in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. This variation demonstrates the impact of different parameter values. These results provide the theoretical groundwork for assessing alternative gravities' viability through gravitational wave data, and aid probably in picking out the alternative gravity theory that best aligns with the empirical reality.

## 9. An introduction to effective potential methods in field theory

**Authors:** Isabella Masina, Mariano Quiros

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12713v1)

**Summary:**

In this chapter we give a pedagogical introduction to effective potential methods in field theories. We first review the general functional methods leading to the concept of effective action and effective potential. We concentrate on some physical applications of the effective potential: i) the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking by radiative corrections, ii) the metastability of the electroweak vacuum in the Standard Model, and iii) the relevance of quantum effects in the dynamics of Higgs inflation. We then apply the previous results to cosmological phase transitions in the early universe.

## 10. Symmetry of screening masses of mesons in two-flavor lattice QCD at high   temperatures

**Authors:** Yasumichi Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Issaku Kanamori, Yoshifumi Nakamura, Christian Rohrhofer, Kei Suzuki, David Ward

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12675v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quark.

## 11. Link in $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$ and the Topological Vertex

**Authors:** John Chae

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12566v1)

**Summary:**

We provide the first computations of colored unknots and Hopf link in the toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We conjecture that they are Poincare series of an infinite dimensional link homology theory. We compare our results with that of the $S^3$ and speculate the consequences of the series nature of the invariants. We find that the link invariants are series in the Kahler parameters of the tori Calabi Yau manifold and the $q$-expansions of the rational functions of theseries have positivity property.
