## 0. De Sitter quantum gravity within the covariant Lorentzian approach to   asymptotic safety

**Authors:** Edoardo D'Angelo, Renata Ferrero, Markus B. Fröb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05135v1)

**Summary:**

The study is the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges. The study was published in the journal Theoretical and Applied Physics.

## 1. Refining Integration-by-Parts Reduction of Feynman Integrals with   Machine Learning

**Authors:** Matt von Hippel, Matthias Wilhelm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05121v1)

**Summary:**

 integration-by-parts reductions of Feynman integrals pose a frequent bottle-neck in state-of-the-art calculations in theoretical particle and gravitational-wave physics. We investigate the use of machine-learning techniques to find improved heuristics. We use funsearch, a genetic programming variant based on code generation by a Large Language Model, to explore possible approaches. We then use strongly typed genetic programming to zero in on useful solutions. Both approaches manage to re-discover the state of the art heuristic recently incorporated into integration- by-parts solvers, and in one example find a small advance on this state ofthe- art.

## 2. On coefficients of operator product expansions for quantum field   theories with ordinary, holomorphic, and topological spacetime dimensions

**Authors:** Luigi Alfonsi, Hyungrok Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05077v1)

**Summary:**

In many quantum field theories, operator product expansions of local operators can have as coefficients not only ordinary functions but also 'derived' functions with nonzero ghost number. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such ' derived' functions to appear. In particular, theories with one topological spacetime dimension and multiple ordinary spacetime dimensions provide a smooth analogue of the (holomorphic) raviolo. We analyse the functions that should appear in operator product. expansions for a quantum field theory with an arbitrary number of topological, holomorphic and/or ordinary Spacetime dimensions.

## 3. Multicenter higher-derivative BPS black holes

**Authors:** Yide Cai, Sabarenath Jayaprakash, James T. Liu, Robert J. Saskowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05065v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the reduction of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus. We construct two-charge multicenter BPS black hole solutions. In $d=5$, the three-form field can be dualized to a gauge field. This makes precise the embedding of known solutions into five-dimensional $\alpha'$-corrected STU supergravity. We then construct three-charge BPS solutions to the dualized Bergshoeff-de Roo action.

## 4. Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians

**Authors:** Klée Pollock, Jonathan D. Kroth, Nathan Pagliaroli, Thomas Iadecola, Jonathan Riddell

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05045v1)

**Summary:**

 Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory. We develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of theenergy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator.

## 5. The generic Markov CoHA is not spherically generated

**Authors:** Ben Davison

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05009v1)

**Summary:**

Let $Q$ be the Markov quiver, and let $W$ be an infinitely mutable potential for $Q$. We calculate some low degree refined BPS invariants for the resulting Jacobi algebra, and use them to show that the critical cohomological Hall algebra is not necessarily spherically generated. This leads to a counterexample to a conjecture of Gaiotto, Grygoryev and Li. We discuss a way to modify the conjecture, by excluding the non-spherical part via the decomposition of the algebra according to the characters of a discrete symmetry group.

## 6. Robustness of Dark Energy Phenomenology Across Different   Parameterizations

**Authors:** William J. Wolf, Carlos García-García, Pedro G. Ferreira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04929v1)

**Summary:**

The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations.

## 7. Hilbert Bundles and Holographic Space-time: the Hydrodynamic Approach to   Gravity

**Authors:** T. Banks

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04924v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum dynamics is defined in a Hilbert bundle over the space of time-like geodesics on the background geometry. A nesting of diamonds along a given geodesic defines a series of unitary embedding maps of diamond Hilbert spaces into each other. According to the QPR, the largest diamond in the overlap between any two diamonds is identified with a tensor factor in each individual diamond Hilbert space. This brief review summarizes how these ideas play out in a variety of contexts in different dimensions.

## 8. Black Strings and String Clouds Embedded in Anisotropic Quintessence:   Solutions for Scalar Particles and Implications

**Authors:** Maria de Lourdes Deglmann, Leonardo G. Barbosa, Celso de Camargo Barros Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the spacetime metric associated with a black string surrounded by a cloud of strings and an anisotropic fluid of quintessence in cylindrically symmetric AdS spacetime. We solve Einstein's equation to obtain the explicit form of the metric. We use the confluent Heun function to solve the Klein-Gordon equation for a spin-0 particle near the event horizon. This modification, in principle, could give rise to an observable that we termed as the dark phase.

## 9. Supersymmetric scale-separated AdS$_3$ vacua of type IIB

**Authors:** Vincent Van Hemelryck

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04791v1)

**Summary:**

I construct supersymmetric, parametrically scale-separated AdS$_3$ vacua of type IIB string theory. These arise as compactifications with orientifold planes on specific seven-dimensional solvmanifolds admitting co-closed $G_2$-structures. There are solutions that include either one set or four sets of intersecting O5-planes in the smeared approximation, and parametric scale separation can be achieved by tuning unbounded fluxes to infinity.

## 10. Why ETH? On thermalization and locality

**Authors:** Stefan Eccles

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04784v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04784v1)

**Summary:**

The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is foundational to modern discussions of thermalization in closed quantum systems. In this work, we expand on traditional explanations for the prevalence of ETH by emphasizing the role of operator locality. We introduce an operator-specific perturbation problem that can be thought of as a means of understanding the onset or breakdown of ETH for specific classes of operators in a given system. We derive explicit functional forms for the off-diagonal variances of operator matrix elements for typical local operators under various `scrambling ansatzes'

## 11. Constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity with future   ground- and space-based gravitational wave detectors

**Authors:** Bo-Yang Zhang, Tao Zhu, Jian-Ming Yan, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04776v1)

**Summary:**

Future ground- and space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to test general relativity (GR) with greater precision. We investigate the capability of future ground-based GW detectors, the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE), for constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity. Our results show that the combined observations of ET and CE will impose significantly tighter bounds on the energy scale of parity. This scenario also enables bounds onthe graviton mass at $m_g \lesssim 10^{-35}\; {\rm GeV}$.

## 12. Equivariant primitives of Eisenstein series for congruence subgroups

**Authors:** Claude Duhr, Franca Lippert

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04752v1)

**Summary:**

We study equivariant primitives of Eisenstein series for principal congruence subgroups. We present closed formulas that naturally generalise existing results for the full modular group. We show that in those cases the non-holomorphic EisensteinSeries of weight two can be written as single-valued logarithms whose argument is a rational function of the Hauptmodul. We also focus on Eisenstein Series of weight 2 in the case where the modular curve has genus zero..

## 13. An Airy Tale at Large $N$

**Authors:** Nikolay Bobev, Pieter-Jan De Smet, Junho Hong, Valentin Reys, Xuao Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04606v1)

**Summary:**

We study the sphere partition function of 3d holographic SCFTs. We argue that the all-order large $N$ perturbative expansion of the partition function resums into a compact expression in terms of an Airy function. We provide ample evidence for this conjecture using numerical methods, saddle point analysis in the 't Hooft limit, and the relation of the squashed sphere partitionfunction to the Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index. Our conjecture has a bearing on the AdS/CFT correspondence and the structure ofperturbative M-theory corrections to 11d supergravity.
