## 0. Holography and Causality in the Karch-Randall Braneworld

**Authors:** Hao Geng, Lisa Randall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21856v1)

**Summary:**

It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy intermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in an explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there can be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic intermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation, but there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement.

## 1. Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and   viscosity

**Authors:** H. A. Adarsha, Chandrachur Chakraborty, Sudip Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843v1)

**Summary:**

Near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When this occurs, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser.

## 2. A Path to Quantum Simulations of Topological Phases: (2+1)D Wilson   Fermions Coupled To U(1) Background Gauge Fields

**Authors:** Sriram Bharadwaj, Emil Rosanowski, Simran Singh, Alice di Tucci, Changnan Peng, Karl Jansen, Lena Funcke, Di Luo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21828v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum simulation offers a powerful approach to studying quantum field theories, particularly (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics. A key challenge is the proper realization of topological phases and the Chern-Simons terms, where fermion discretization plays a crucial role. We analyze staggered and Wilson fermions coupled to background gauge fields in the Hamiltonian formulation. We further outline connections to experimental platforms, offering guidance for implementations on near-term quantum computing architectures. The findings resolve existing ambiguities in Hamiltonian formulations and provide a theoretical foundation for future quantum simulations.

## 3. Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite   temperature

**Authors:** Herondy Mota, K. E. L. de Farias

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21766v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21766v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem.

## 4. Thermoelectric Thomson coefficient of quark-gluon plasma in the presence   of a time-varying magnetic field

**Authors:** Kamaljeet Singh, Raghunath Sahoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21734v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21734v1)

**Summary:**

Heavy-ion collision experiments offer a unique platform to study several key properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) Quarks, being the electrically charged particles, can induce an electric current in the medium in response to the temperature gradients. The thermoelectric coefficients, such as the Seebeck and Thomson coefficients, can help us to understand the intricate transport phenomenon of the medium. For the first time, we calculate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients in QGP.

## 5. Higher derivative corrections to Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics

**Authors:** Wei Guo, Xiyao Guo, Xin Lan, Hongbao Zhang, Wei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21724v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the well justified background subtraction method to calculate the first order corrections to Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics. The computation is further simplified by the decomposition trick for the bulk action. The validity of our results is further substantiated by examining the corrections induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. We can extract some generic information about the first-order corrected black hole solutions induced by each higher derivative term. The results are compared with those obtained via the ADM and Wald formulas in the Lorentz signature.

## 6. Superstring amplitudes meet surfaceology

**Authors:** Qu Cao, Jin Dong, Song He, Fan Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21676v1)

**Summary:**

We reformulate tree-level amplitudes in open superstring theory (type-I) in terms of stringy Tr$(\phi^3) amplitudes with various kinematical shifts. We provide both the worldsheet and "curve-integral" derivations, and discuss applications to heterotic and type II cases. These interesting linear combinations of bosonic string amplitudes must guarantee the cancellation of tachyon poles and $F^3$ vertices. We give new relations between the superstring amplitude and its bosonic-string building blocks to all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion.

## 7. Universal Structures and Emergent Geometry from Large-$c$ BCFT Ensemble

**Authors:** Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Bing-Xin Lao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21660v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the ensemble average of boundary CFT (BCFT) data consistent with the bootstrap equations. We find a natural emergence of locality and a loop-sum structure reminiscent of lattice integrable models. We provide strong evidence that, at leading order in large-$c$, the results match those of three-dimensional Einstein gravity. In the presence of closed CFT operator insertions, generalized free fields emerge, with their correlation functions governed by the shortest paths connecting the insertions.

## 8. Rank-two tensors and deconfinement in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ gauge   theories

**Authors:** Antonio Amariti, Fabio Mantegazza, Simone Rota

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21654v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study the IR dynamics of $SU(N)$ gauge theories with four supercharges in 3d in presence of symmetric or antisymmetric tensor. Using the tensor deconfinement technique we provide some proofs of results previously claimed in the literature. Furthermore we study 3d confining dualities with symmetric tensors and linear monopole superpotentials. We conclude the analysis providing an alternative derivation, again using the Tensor deconFinement technique.

## 9. On U-Folds and Their Construction

**Authors:** Stefano Maurelli, Ruggero Noris, Marcelo Oyarzo, Mario Trigiante

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21590v1)

**Summary:**

We review a general paradigm for constructing U-fold backgrounds in (dimensionally reduced) Type IIB superstring theory. We also consider a special instance with $d=3$ in Type 2B super string theory, discuss its ten-dimensional uplift and assess its supersymmetry. We conclude with a discussion of the role of superstrings in the theory of string-duality groups and their role in string-universality groups, and the role they play in superstring theories.

## 10. Schwinger's non-commutative coordinates and duality between helicity and   Dirac quantisation conditions

**Authors:** George Savvidy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21529v1)

**Summary:**

The helicity operator of massless particles has only two polarisations like it takes place for photons and gravitons. For them not all of the 2s+1 spin magnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions. The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operators appear explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity.

## 11. On type IIB AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua with scale separation and integer   conformal dimensions

**Authors:** √Ålvaro Arboleya, Adolfo Guarino, Matteo Morittu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21508v1)

**Summary:**

We review recent progress in constructing type IIB AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua that exhibit parametrically-controlled scale separation. We comment on the anisotropic nature of the associated internal spaces, as well as on the existence of polynomial shift symmetries underlying the mass spectra. We conclude by outlining open questions and potential directions for future research, partially inspired by the Swampland program. The paper is based on an earlier version of this article.

## 12. Domain Wall as Cosmological Oscillator

**Authors:** Bo-Qiang Lu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21498v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we examine the domain wall within the framework of a cosmological harmonic oscillator. We investigate the interaction between the domain. wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in the. oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for resolving the domainwall problem through the phenomenon of resonant oscillation. If the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation threshold, the Domain Wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.

## 13. Dual $Œ∫$-Minkowski spaces and $Œ∫$-Poincar√© algebras from   Yang model and their Weyl realizations

**Authors:** T. Martiniƒá Bilaƒá, S. Meljanac, S. Mignemi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21482v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the Yang algebras isomorphic to $o(1,5), o(2,4) and o(3,3) The corresponding Weyl realization is presented and coproduct, star product and twist are computed in terms of the metric $g$. Finally, we construct reduced $\kappa$-Minkowski and $kappa-Poincar\'{e} algebraes as special cases. The corresponding reduced Weyl realizes are presented and Coproduct and Star Product are computed.

## 14. Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological   investigation

**Authors:** Roshna K, V. Sreenath

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomalies with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenology models. We investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models.

## 15. Prediction of $p\barŒ©$ states and femtoscopic study

**Authors:** Ye Yan, Qi Huang, Qian Wu, Hongxia Huang, Jialun Ping

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21376v1)

**Summary:**

The attraction between a nucleon and a quark is slightly stronger than that between a nucleus and $Omega. This suggests that the $p \bar{\Omega}$ system is more likely to form bound states. The scattering phase shift and scattering parameter calculations also support the existence of $p\bar\Omega$ states. Additionally, we discuss the behavior of the femtoscopic correlation function for the $ p\bar\/Omega' pairs for the first time. We conclude that the further study of the $P \bar\'Omega" systems using femtoscope techniques will be a very valuable work.

## 16. Quantization of Anisotropic Topological Yang Mills Theory

**Authors:** Emil Albrychiewicz, Andr√©s Franco Valiente, Viola Zixin Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21295v1)

**Summary:**

Anisotropic topological field theories arise from a tropical limit of conventional isotropic field theories. We analyze both the TBF theory and the tropical analogue of 2D topological Yang-Mills theory (TrYM) We conjecture that the large $N$ expansion of the associated matrix model of TrYM is associated to the wedge region of nonequilibrium string theory. We show that the partition function has an asymptotic limit, which verifies that the dimension of the moduli space of tropicalized flat connection on a Riemann surface of genus $g>1$ is precisely given.
