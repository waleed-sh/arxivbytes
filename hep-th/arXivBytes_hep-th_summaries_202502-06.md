## 0. Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to   Quantum Fisher Information

**Authors:** Nilachal Chakrabarti, Neha Nirbhan, Arpan Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03434v1)

**Summary:**

A non-Hermitian SSH model arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state increases with the measurement rate. We show that the measurement-induced transition can be detected using a generalized measure in Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional in the model.

## 1. On analytic continuation from imaginary to real chemical potential in   Lattice QCD

**Authors:** Francesco Di Renzo, Marco Aliberti, Petros Dimopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03392v1)

**Summary:**

Imaginary baryon number chemical potential simulations are a popular workaround for the (in)famous sign problem plaguing finite density QCD studies on the lattice. One is necessarily left with the problem of analytically continuing results to real values of $\mu_B$. In the framework of the Bielefeld Parma Collaboration, we have in recent years studied a multi-point Pad\'e description of the net baryON number density. We report on the status of our projects with this respect.

## 2. U(1)-gauged 2-flavor spin system in 3-D

**Authors:** Christof Gattringer, Tin Sulejmanpasic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03371v1)

**Summary:**

We study a U(1)-gauged 2- component spin system in 3 dimensions. Our preliminary Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the system undergoes a second order phase transition driven by the spin coupling. We conclude that the transition is likely weakly 1st order, passing close to a multi-critical point. To reliably resolve the nature of the transition, simulations on larger lattices will be necessary. For the gauge fields we use the Villain formulation with a constraint that removes lattice monopoles. We discuss the simulation strategies for this highly constraint system.

## 3. Heat engines for scale invariant systems dual to black holes

**Authors:** Nikesh Lilani, Manus R. Visser

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363v1)

**Summary:**

According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a novel realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles.

## 4. Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative   Einstein-Maxwell equation

**Authors:** Filip Požar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the Drinfeld twist. We solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the nonCommutative parameter $a$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole. The electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr- newman potential. We introduce a nonzero term proportional to $a$ in the electromagnetic potential.

## 5. Degenerate higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories

**Authors:** Aimeric Colléaux, Karim Noui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03311v1)

**Summary:**

We classify higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories linear in the curvature tensor and quadratic in the derivatives of the electromagnetic field strength. We then classify degenerate non-minimally coupled interactions, obtaining all conformally invariant ones. Finally, we investigate the effect of U(1)-preserving disformal transformations on these degenerate Lagrangians. The ``mimetic" singular transformations are obtained and new ghost-free degenerate theories are generated. This provides a generalisation ofquadratic degenerate higher- order scalar-tensor theories for a U( 1) gauge field.

## 6. Finiteness of the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons action in linear covariant   gauges by taking into account gauge copies

**Authors:** Daniel O. R. Azevedo, Antonio D. Pereira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03284v1)

**Summary:**

In recent years, the effects of removing infinitesimal Gribov copies from the path integral of gauge-fixed Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories have been investigated. Part of the interest resides on the fact that such an elimination of gauge copies introduces a mass parameter. We establish the renormalization properties of such a theory at all orders in perturbation theory by means of the algebraic renormalized framework. We show that the removal of infiniteimal G ribov copies does not affect the standard non-renormalization. properties of standard gauge- fixed Yang- mills-chern-simons theories, i.e., the theory is finite.

## 7. Two-loop helicity amplitudes for diphoton production with massive quark   loop

**Authors:** Taushif Ahmed, Amlan Chakraborty, Ekta Chaubey, Mandeep Kaur

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03282v1)

**Summary:**

The effect of a heavy quark is expected to play a crucial role in high-luminosity LHC. We compute two-loop helicity amplitudes in QCD for diphoton production through quark- and gluon-initiated channels. We account for a massive internal quark loop by keeping its full mass dependence. This work paves the way for calculating the cross-section for dip hoton production at higher orders in Q CD with a massive quark loops.

## 8. High-precision numerical evaluation of Lauricella functions

**Authors:** M. A. Bezuglov, B. A. Kniehl, A. I. Onishchenko, O. L. Veretin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03276v1)

**Summary:**

We present a method for high-precision numerical evaluations of Lauricella functions, whose indices are linearly dependent on some parameter. This method is based on finding analytic continuations of these functions in terms of Frobenius generalized power series. The method has been implemented in the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package, written in Wolfram Mathematica language. To accelerate the calculation procedure further, the dependence of the result is reconstructed from the evaluations of given LaurICElla functions at specific numerical values of $\varepsilon.

## 9. Percolation of Domain Walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model

**Authors:** Richard A. Battye, Steven J. Cotterill, Eva Sabater Andres, Adam K. Thomasson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03209v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03209v1)

**Summary:**

 Domain walls formed during a phase transition in a simple field theory model have been demonstrated to annihilate as fast as causality allows. We suggest that this is due to the build up of superconducting currents on the walls which could lead ultimately to stationary configurations known as Kinky Vortons. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the production of Vorton in three spatial dimensions. The study was published in the open-access journal, The Astrophysics of Complex Systems (ASC)

## 10. Landau-Lifshitz Solutions of N=2, D=5 Supergravity

**Authors:** W. A. Sabra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03195v1)

**Summary:**

We study families of solutions depending only on one coordinate for the theories of N=2,five-dimensional supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. The explicit metrics of the solutions depend on the Jordan normal forms of constrained matrices. Four families of solution, valid for all space-time signatures, are obtained. Examples with three charges are given for the so-called STU model. For more information, visit: http://www.sciencemag.org/article/supergravity-and-theory-of-n-2,5-dimensional-supergravity.

## 11. Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational   Axion-like Interactions

**Authors:** Claudio Corianò, Stefano Lionetti, Dario Melle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. We show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials. The results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit.

## 12. Semihard interactions at high energies

**Authors:** T. V. Iser, E. G. S. Luna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03168v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit a minijet model to examine the behavior of the total cross section and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude at high energies. We find evidence in both cases suggesting the necessity of an odd semihard component that becomes asymptotically significant at high energy. We analyze data separately from the TOTEM and ATLAS/ALFA Collaborations. The QCD contribution to the jet production is computed in the next-to-leading order. In this framework, the growth of $pp$ and $p$ channels is driven bySemihard partonic processes dominated by gluon interactions.

## 13. QCD Equation of State with Strong Magnetic Fields and Nonzero Baryon   Density

**Authors:** Heng-Tong Ding, Jin-Biao Gu, Arpith Kumar, Sheng-Tai Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03152v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03152v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we have carried out lattice simulations of $(2+1)$-flavor QCD using highly improved staggered quarks at the physical pion mass. We present lattice QCD continuum estimate results, along with the magnetized hadron resonance and ideal gas comparisons. We focus on the significant impact of strong magnetic fields on bulk thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, number density, energy density, and entropy density, focusing on the strong magnetic field strengths of the lattice.

## 14. Conformal Partial Wave Expansion of Celestial Correlators

**Authors:** Francesca Pacifico, Charlotte Sleight, Massimo Taronna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03087v1)

**Summary:**

A novel definition of holographic correlation functions on the celestial sphere of Minkowski space was recently introduced in arXiv:2301.01810. We show that in perturbation theory such celestial correlation functions admit a conformal partial wave expansion with meromorphic spectral density. This is achieved by extending the harmonic function (``spectral") decomposition of AdS bulk-to-bulk propagators to the Minksowski Feynman propagator. We also discuss the conformalpartial wave expansion at the non-perturbative level, where Lorentz unitarity manifests as positivity.

## 15. Lattice Weyl Fermion on a Single Spherical Domain-Wall

**Authors:** Shoto Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Naoto Kan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03045v1)

**Summary:**

In the absence of a gauge potential, Weyl fermions emerge as edge-localized modes along the $S^2$ domain-wall. When a nontrivial $U(1)$ gauge potential is present, additional zero modes with opposite chirality appears, localized at the center near the monopole. This centrally localized mode originates from the effective mass contribution of the Wilson term, which induces a domain- wall near the pole. The negative mass region is confined inside the Domain-Wall, while the positive mass outside is taken to the infinite limit.

## 16. On the Underlying Nonrelativistic Nature of Relativistic Holography

**Authors:** Alberto Guijosa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03031v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that standard, relativistic holography can now be recognized as a statement within a corresponding nonrelativistic brane theory. Our main conclusions are general, but within the familiar example of D3-brane based holographY, they read as follows. We argue that Newton-Cartan geometry is the underlying structure upon which entanglement of the D3brane degrees of freedom builds relativists spacetime. We conclude that AdS/CFT duality is precisely synonymous with black-branes/D-brains duality within NR D3/M theory.

## 17. Cherenkov emission by fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole

**Authors:** Sergei Khlebnikov, Maxim Lyutikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811v1)

**Summary:**

In the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric produces Cherenkov emission. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_g$ is the Schwarzschild radius.
