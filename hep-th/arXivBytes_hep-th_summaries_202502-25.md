## 0. Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and   Recent Observational Results

**Authors:** Marco Antonio Cardoso Alvarez, Leila Graef, Robert Brandenberger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17395v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17395v1)

**Summary:**

Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmologists constant. The recent DESI data, which supports the possibility of dynamical dark energy, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work, we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of superHubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model.

## 1. D=4, N=2 Supergravity: An Unconventional Application

**Authors:** Laura Andrianopoli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17324v1)

**Summary:**

Top-down approach relating N=2, D=4 pure supergravity with non-trivial boundary behavior to a (2+1)-dimensional analog model. This is obtained, in a special asymptotic limit, by imposing an unconventional realization of supersymmetry in the D=3 boundary model. It is able to describe the electronic properties of graphene-like materials in a 2+1-dimensional model. The results are published in the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 2. Global monopole in a Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity

**Authors:** F. M. Belchior, R. V. Maluf, A. Yu. Petrov, P. J. Porfírio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267v1)

**Summary:**

Black hole solutions in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR) bumblebee gravity sourced by a global monopole. This modified theory of gravity possesses the notable feature of incorporating local Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. Next, we study the impact of theglobal monopole and LSB corrections on two classical tests, namely, the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the light deflection. Ultimately, we estimate an upper bound for $\eta$ by comparing the theoretical results provided by the EKR model with observational data.

## 3. Gray-body factors: Method matters

**Authors:** Alexandre Arbey, Marco Calzà, Yuber F. Perez-Gonzalez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17240v1)

**Summary:**

The Chandrasekhar formalism is effective for static black holes. It faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. An alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. For a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the ChandraseKhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. We assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black hole.

## 4. Five-point functions and the permutation group S5

**Authors:** Gernot Eichmann, Raul D. Torres

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17225v1)

**Summary:**

Five-point functions and five-body wave functions play an important role in many areas of nuclear and particle physics. In this work we consider the permutation group S5 to facilitate the description of such objects. We arrange the four-momenta and Lorentz invariants of a five-point function into the multiplet structure. We work out the color tensors of the five-gluon vertices in multiplet notation. We discuss applications for five- body wave functions like those of pentaquarks.

## 5. The large-charge expansion in nonrelativistic conformal field theories

**Authors:** Vito Pellizzani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17224v1)

**Summary:**

Conformal field theories (CFTs) are associated with critical phenomena and phase transitions. Solving a CFT is an extremely constrained problem due to conformal invariance. In recent years, a new powerful tool has emerged: the large-charge expansion. It allows to systemically uncover part of the CFT data of theories with global symmetries, thereby revealing profound and universal features of these systems. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress which opened the door to many new exciting large- charge applications.

## 6. Late-Time Saturation of Black Hole Complexity

**Authors:** Friðrik Freyr Gautason, Vyshnav Mohan, Lárus Thorlacius

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17179v1)

**Summary:**

The holographic complexity of a static spherically symmetric black hole grows linearly with time at late times in general relativity. The growth comes from a region at a constant transverse area inside the black hole and continues forever in the classical theory. In this region the volume complexity of any spheric black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions reduces to a geodesic length in an effective two-dimensional JT-gravity theory. The length has been argued to saturate at very late times via non-perturbative corrections.

## 7. Gauge Invariant Effective Potential

**Authors:** Debanjan Balui, Joydeep Chakrabortty, Debmalya Dey, Subhendra Mohanty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17156v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the long-standing problem of gauge dependence of the effective potential arises due to the factorisation of the determinant of operators. We show by correcting for this assumption by computing the multiplicative anomaly, the gauge-dependent terms of theeffective potential cancel. We also show that in two- and odd-dimensional non-compact spacetime manifolds, the standard calculation of one-loop effective potential gives a gauge-independent result. We advocate the Heat-Kernel expansion as the most straightforward method, as it naturally deals with the matrix elliptic operator.

## 8. Bound states around vacuum in scalar ModMax model

**Authors:** F. A. Brito, M. A. Marques, R. Menezes, E. Passos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17107v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we consider a two-dimensional scalar field model inspired by the dimensional reduction of a four-dimensional ModMax theory. By studying the linear stability of the model, we show that fluctuations around the uniform field are described by a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue equation. Remarkably, the presence of the aforementioned weight may bring bound states to light, contrary to what occurs in the canonical model. We show that the solutions for the non-uniform field can be mapped into the ones arising from the canonical models.

## 9. A Multipole-Based Framework for Kerr Black Hole Mimickers: From General   Construction to a Specific Case of Study

**Authors:** Claudio Gambino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17032v1)

**Summary:**

We present a novel framework for constructing solutions to the Einstein equations with an arbitrary multipolar structure. We provide a systematic method to identify physically reasonable energy-momentum tensors that source black hole mimickers. As an example, we investigate an anisotropic fluid with a gaussian-like energy-density profile that, at linearized level, satisfies all energy and causality conditions. We obtain a fully non-perturbative solution that describes either a horizonless Schwarzschild mimicker or a static regular black hole model with a resolved curvature singularity.

## 10. Thermoelectric effects of an interacting hadron gas in the presence of   an external magnetic field

**Authors:** Kamaljeet Singh, Kshitish Kumar Pradhan, Dushmanta Sahu, Raghunath Sahoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16853v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16853v1)

**Summary:**

Hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC and LHC energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectedric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like coefficients. For the first time, we estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient.

## 11. Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational   collapse in asymptotically safe gravity

**Authors:** Tomohiro Harada, Chiang-Mei Chen, Rituparna Mandal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787v1)

**Summary:**

We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity. We investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid. We successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black hole. The resulting regular blackhole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric.

## 12. A duality of Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces inside and outside the horizon

**Authors:** Wu-zhong Guo, Jin Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16774v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16774v1)

**Summary:**

We study the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces associated with timelike subregions in static spacetimes with a horizon. These RT surfaces can extend into the horizon, allowing us to probe the interior of the black hole. We demonstrate that the area of the RT surface inside the horizon can be reconstructed from the contributions of RT surfaces outside the horizon. This result provides a concrete realization of black hole complementarity, where the information from the black Hole interior can be reconstructed from the degrees of freedom outside it.
