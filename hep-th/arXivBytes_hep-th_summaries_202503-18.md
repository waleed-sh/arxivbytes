## 0. Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?

**Authors:** Dmitry Khudoteplov, Alexei Morozov, Alexey Sleptsov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum knot invariants are a class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebraes might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie alges.

## 1. Spectral properties and spin alignment of $φ$ meson in QCD Matter

**Authors:** Zhong-Yuan Sun, You-Yu Li, Shuai Y. F. Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13408v1)

**Summary:**

The spin alignment of a vector meson is predicted to be correlated with its spectral properties. We study the spectral properties of the $\phi$ meson using two microscopic Lagrangians based on chiral effective field theory or the quark-meson model. Using these spectral functions, transport coefficients related to the spin alignment and tensor polarization are obtained. We discover that, with certain assumptions, these simple microscopic model-based calculations can produce sizable spin alignments with a sign-flipping behavior.

## 2. Generalized scalar field models in the presence of impurities

**Authors:** D. Bazeia, M. A. Marques, R. Menezes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13381v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13381v1)

**Summary:**

We study generalized scalar field models coupled to impurities in Minkowski spacetime with arbitrary dimensions. The investigation concerns a class of models that depends explicitly on the spacetime coordinates and also, it reveals the presence of a second-order tensor that can have null divergence if a first-order equation and a constraint are satisfied. The results show that stable solutions can be obtained in arbitrary dimensions, and the stability seems to be related to the first- order equation that emerges from imposing null divergence of the aforementioned tensor.

## 3. Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$   matrix models

**Authors:** H. L. Dao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13368v1)

**Summary:**

Two types of quantum circuits named TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits. The circuits can be used to solve the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of these new circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently.

## 4. New multiple soft theorem from split-helicity amplitude decomposition

**Authors:** Andriniaina Narindra Rasoanaivo, Fanomezantsoa Arlivah Andriantsarafara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13363v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the soft decomposition of tree level gluon amplitudes of split-helicity configuration. We show how any split- helicity amplitude can be fully fixed from inverse soft limit using BCFW calculation. We obtain a compact formula for the corresponding soft operators which is a simple combination of individual single soft operators. Then we generate the leading and sub-leading soft factors using soft momentum expansion, to compare with results derived from standard calculation. The double and triple soft theorem can manifest beyond perturbative calculation from split-Helicity decomposition.

## 5. Exploring Scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theories Through the Lens of   Parametrized Post-Newtonian Formalism

**Authors:** Martín G. Richarte, Júnior D. Toniato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13339v1)

**Summary:**

We explore scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories within the context of the Parameterized Post-Newtonian formalism. We use data from the Cassini mission, Lunar Laser Ranging, and the forthcoming BepiColombo mission, in conjunction with geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry measurements around the Sun. This approach enables us to impose a variety of constraints on the parameter space, particularly focusing on the PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$.

## 6. Radiative corrections on vortical spin polarization in hot QCD matter

**Authors:** Shuo Fang, Shi Pu, Di-Lun Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13320v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the radiative corrections on spin polarization of relativistic fermions induced by vortical fields in thermal-equilibrium QCD matter at weak coupling. Such corrections stem from the self-energy gradients in quantum kinetic theory. We obtain new corrections upon the spin-polarization spectrum and also the axial-charge current for massive quarks up to the leading order of the QCD coupling. Further influence on spin alignment of vector mesons from similar effects is also analyzed.

## 7. Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models

**Authors:** Huan Jiang, Shao-Kai Jian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13247v1)

**Summary:**

We use mean-field theory to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments. It also provides theoretical prediction for experiments in the quantum field theory of quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics.

## 8. On black holes in teleparallel torsion theories of gravity

**Authors:** Alan A. Coley, Nicholas T. Layden, Diego F. Lopez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13215v1)

**Summary:**

Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime within general relativity. In this sense the resulting spacetime is {\em not} a black hole spacetime. We investigate static spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes within the more general $F(T)$ teleparallel gravity. We show that if a such a geometry admits a horizon, then the torsion scalar $T$ necessarily diverges there. We then briefly consider the Kerr-like solution in the telepar parallel equivalent of general relativity and obtain a similar result.

## 9. Scale-Dependent Suppression Functions and Functional Space Geometry in   Renormalization

**Authors:** Daniel Ketels

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the effects of a scale-dependent suppression function on the functional space geometry in renormalization theory. The suppression function smoothly regulates high-momentum contributions without requiring a hard cutoff. We show that it induces a modified metric on functional space, leading to a non-trivial Ricci curvature that becomes increasingly negative in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. Our findings provide a mathematical framework for studying regularization techniques and their role in the UV behavior of function spaces. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.

## 10. Half-wormholes in a complex SYK model

**Authors:** Yingyu Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13172v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13172v1)

**Summary:**

When the chemical potential is zero, the result is similar to two decoupled Majorana SYK models. There's a disk contribution in a single copy of the model, which is a bit subdominant to the unlinked half-wormhole. After removing out the disk we find out the linked half- wormhole which restores the factorization in the two copies of the complex SYK model. When the chemical possible is small, the disk gets more enhancement than the wormhole and the half-wormshole.

## 11. Standard Model Symmetries and K(E_10)

**Authors:** Krzysztof A. Meissner, Hermann Nicolai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13155v1)

**Summary:**

We amend a scheme originally proposed by M. Gell-Mann to identify the three families of quarks and leptons of the Standard Model with the 48 spin 1/2 fermions of N=8 supergravity. We explain how to deform and enlarge this symmetry at the kinematical level to the full Standard Model symmetry group SU(3)_c x SU(2)_w x U(1)_Y. This scheme, which is also supposed to encompass quantum gravity, cannot be realized within the framework of space-time based quantum field theory.

## 12. Regular black holes and their singular families

**Authors:** Hyat Huang, Xiao-Pin Rao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13133v1)

**Summary:**

Regular black holes without curvature singularity can arise in Einstein gravity with appropriate matter energy-momentum tensor. We show that these regular solutions represent only a special case of a much broader family of black holes with a free mass parameter. The regularity is achieved only at a specific mass value, and any deviation from the fine-tuned parameter inevitably results in curvatures singularity. A new NLED theory is proposed that is a generalization of the Bardeen class and the Hayward class.

## 13. Neutrino Decoherence in \texorpdfstring{\(κ\)}{kappa}-Minkowski   Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm

**Authors:** Partha Nandi, Tiasha Bhattacharyya, A. S. Majumdar, Graeme Pleasance, Francesco Petruccione

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061v1)

**Summary:**

We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significantDecoherence for high-energy neutrinos. We also establish conditions under which quantum Spacetime effects could influence relic neutrines, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spactime fluctuations impact neutRino oscillation physics.

## 14. Hot Casimir wormholes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity

**Authors:** C. R. Muniz, M. B. Cruz, R. M. P. Neves, Mushayydha Farooq, M. Zubair

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12943v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we explore the thermal effects on Casimir wormholes in the context of higher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. By deriving the shape function from the EGB field equations with thermally corrected Casimir energy, we verify that all necessary conditions for wormhole formation are satisfied, including asymptotic flatness and throat stability. Our results indicate that thermal corrections modify of the wormhole geometry, increasing spatial curvature in the throat region and influencing its traversability. We analyze gravitational Casimir effects and discuss their possible role in modified gravity theories.

## 15. Resurgence in the Universal Structures in B-model Topological String   Theory

**Authors:** Yong Li, David Sauzin, Shanzhong Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12815v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a systematic analysis of Alim-Yau-Zhou's double scaling limit and Couso-Santamar\'{i}a's large radius limit for the perturbative free energies in B-model topological string theory. Taking advantage of the known resurgent properties of the formal solutions to the Airy equation, we show how to rigorously derive the non-perturbative information. We also discuss the Borel-Laplace summation of the obtained resurgent transseries.

## 16. Higher-form anomaly and long-range entanglement of mixed states

**Authors:** Leonardo A. Lessa, Shengqi Sang, Tsung-Cheng Lu, Timothy H. Hsieh, Chong Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12792v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12792v1)

**Summary:**

In open quantum systems, we directly relate anomalies of higher-form symmetries to the long-range entanglement of any mixed state. It is then shown that strong symmetry of a mixed state and their anomalies are intrinsic features of the entire phase of matter. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to the toric code under Pauli-X and Z dephasing noise, as well as under ZX decoherence, which gives rise to the recently discovered intrinsically mixed-state topological order.

## 17. Topological invariant for holographic Weyl-$\boldmath Z_2$ semimetal

**Authors:** Xiantong Chen, Xuanting Ji, Ya-Wen Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12791v1)

**Summary:**

For holographic topological semimetals, a topological Hamiltonian method needs to be employed to calculate the topological invariants due to the strong coupling nature of the system. In both cases, we have identified an effective band structure characterized by an infinite number of Weyl or $\boldmath Z_2$ nodes, a distinctive feature of holographic systems different from weakly coupled systems. The topological invariants of these nodes are computed numerically and found to be nonzero, thereby confirming the topologically nontrivial nature of these nodes.

## 18. Bras and Kets in Euclidean Path Integrals

**Authors:** Edward Witten

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12771v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12771v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum mechanics requires a hermitian inner product <~,~> -- linear in one variable, antilinear in the other. The inner product that comes most naturally from Euclidean path integrals is linear in each variable. In a theory with no time-reversal or reflection symmetry, they differ by an operator that conjugates the wavefunction and reverses the orientation of space. In the presence of reflection and time- reversal symmetry, space is unoriented so such an operator cannot be defined.

## 19. Renormalization of Schrödinger equation for potentials with   inverse-square singularities: Generalized Trigonometric Pöschl-Teller model

**Authors:** U. Camara da Silva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a renormalization procedure necessary for the complete description of the energy spectra of a one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation with a potential that exhibits inverse-square singularities. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity. We apply and extend the methods introduced in our recent paper on the hyperbolic P\'osch Teller potential.
