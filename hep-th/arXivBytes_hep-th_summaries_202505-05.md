## 0. Neutrino mass generation in asymptotically safe gravity

**Authors:** Gustavo P. de Brito, Astrid Eichhorn, Antonio D. Pereira, Masatoshi Yamada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01422v1)

**Summary:**

There exist several distinct phenomenological models to generate neutrino masses. We explore, which of these models can consistently be embedded in a quantum theory of gravity and matter. We proceed by invoking a minimal number of degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model. Second, we explore whether the type-I Seesaw mechanism is viable and discover an upper bound on the Sees Saw scale. Third, we explored whether neutrinos could also be Pseudo-Dirac-neutrinos in asymptotic safety.

## 1. Weyl symmetry in $(D_4,D_4)$ conformal matter on a circle

**Authors:** Xing-Yue Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01418v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01418v1)

**Summary:**

Weyl symmetry in quadrivalently glued 5-brane webs of rank $N$ conformal matter theories on a circle. When $N\geq 2$, the theory has 64 different sets of affine $E_8$ invariant Coulomb branch parameters. We find that these theories all have affine £$E 8$ Weyl symmetry in their brane webs, which indicates that they all have Affine E £$ global symmetry.

## 2. Extending knot polynomials of braided Hopf algebras to links

**Authors:** Stavros Garoufalidis, Matthew Harper, Ben-Michael Kohli, Jiebo Song, Guillaume Tahar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01398v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01398v1)

**Summary:**

We study the extension of these knot invariants to links, and use this to identify some of them with known link invariants. We use the Reshetikhin-Turaev functor to apply the knot polynomials to rigid $R$-matrices that come for braided Hopf algebras with automorphisms. We also use this functor for identifying some of the multivariable knot poynomials that were introduced by Kashaev and another author.

## 3. Identifying regions for asymptotic expansions of amplitudes:   fundamentals and recent advances

**Authors:** Yao Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01368v1)

**Summary:**

This review paper discusses the identification of regions, a crucial first step in applying the "method-of-regions" technique. A systematic approach based on Newton polytope geometry has proven successful and efficient for many cases. However, obtaining the correct list of regions becomes increasingly subtle with higher loop numbers or specific Feynman graph topologies. This paper explores the scenarios where such subtleties arise, outlines general strategies to address them, and reviews the current understanding of region structures in various asymptotic expansions ofFeynman integrals.

## 4. Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime

**Authors:** Karthik Iyer, Chandrachur Chakraborty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367v1)

**Summary:**

We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test gyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field behavior ofspin precession could have important implications for transmuted black holes formed via collapse or mergers.

## 5. Gravitational Wave Memory of Primordial Black Hole Mergers

**Authors:** Silvia Gasparotto, Gabriele Franciolini, Valerie Domcke

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01356v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers and the implications for a matched filtering search.

## 6. Holographic Conformal Anomaly and a-Theorem in 5D Scalar-Tensor Theories   from Heterotic Strings

**Authors:** Tianhao Wu, Michael Stone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01310v1)

**Summary:**

We present a novel derivation of the full holographic conformal anomaly in two five-dimensional scalar-tensor theories. We also construct exact asymptotically AdS solutions with linear dilaton profiles. Our results confirm the consistency of AdS/CFT in the presence of non-minimal scalar couplings and higher curvature terms. We show how string-theoretic modifications control the emergence of conformal anomalies and constrain the RG structure of dual field theories.

## 7. $η$ regularisation and the functional measure

**Authors:** Robert G. C. Smith, Murdock Grewar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01290v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. We explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function that encodes this dependence. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism.

## 8. Innermost stable circular orbit of arbitrary-mass compact binaries at   fourth post-Newtonian order

**Authors:** Luc Blanchet, David Langlois, Etienne Ligout

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278v1)

**Summary:**

We compute by means of post-Newtonian methods the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of arbitrary-mass (in particular, comparable-mass) compact binaries. We also compute explicitly the gauge transformation from harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the tail contribution therein. Our final gauge invariant result is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift computed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio limit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity calculation.

## 9. Hamiltonian Analysis of Pre-geometric Gravity

**Authors:** Andrea Addazi, Salvatore Capozziello, Antonino Marcianò, Giuseppe Meluccio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01272v1)

**Summary:**

The Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity can arise from a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking within the context of pre-geometric gauge theories. In this work, we develop the Hamiltonian analysis of such theories. We show that all the results of canonical General Relativity are correctly recovered in the IR limit of the spontaneously broken phase. We also discuss possible pathways toward a UV completion of Generalrelativity, including a pre- geometric generalisation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and an extended BF formulation.

## 10. On homomorphisms from finite subgroups of $SU(2)$ to Langlands dual   pairs of groups

**Authors:** Yuki Kojima, Yuji Tachikawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01253v1)

**Summary:**

Phenomenon predicts that $N(\Gamma,G)$ is a finite subgroup of $SU(2) when $G$ is connected compact simple Lie group. This statement is known to be true when $\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}_n$, but the statement for non-Abelian $Gamma$ is new. A more refined version of the conjecture, together with proofs of some concrete cases, will also be presented. The authors would like to ask mathematicians to provide a more uniform proof applicable to all cases.

## 11. Exact islands scenario for CFT systems and critical ratios in higher   geometry

**Authors:** Harvendra Singh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01247v1)

**Summary:**

We study $CFT_d$ systems which are in contact with each other and symmetrically arranged. System-B is treated as bath that surrounds system-A in the middle. Our focus is to learn how the entanglement entropy of a bath pair system changes as a function of its size. It is found that for strip shaped systems the bath entropy becomes maximum when respective system sizes follow Fibonacci type critical ratio condition. Beyond critical point when bath size increases the bath Entanglement Entropies starts decreasing.

## 12. Perturbative LVS and Inflation: A Review of Volume Modulus and Fibre   Scenarios

**Authors:** George K. Leontaris, Pramod Shukla

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01246v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01246v1)

**Summary:**

In type IIB superstring compactifications, incorporating log-loop corrections can stabilize the overall volume of the compact internal space at exponentially large values. This mechanism forms the basis of the perturbative Large Volume Scenario (LVS) In this report, we briefly review two inflationary models realized within the LVS framework. The first one is the volume modulus inflation (also known as inflection point inflation) and the second one is popularly known as fibre inflation. Using an explict Calabi-Yau orientifold, some concrete global embeddings of both models are also discussed.

## 13. Hexagonal Wilson loop with Lagrangian insertion at two loops in   $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory

**Authors:** Sérgio Carrôlo, Dmitry Chicherin, Johannes Henn, Qinglin Yang, Yang Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01245v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we compute the two-loop result of the null hexagonal Wilson loop with a Lagrangian insertion in planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Normalized by the null polygonal Wilson loop itself, the integrand-level result of this observable corresponds to the logarithm of the six-point three-loop amplitude in this theory. We fix all indeterminates in this ansatz by imposing physical constraints, such as symmetries and absence of spurious divergences.

## 14. Exploring String Theory Solutions: Black hole thermodynamics with   $α'$ corrections and type II compactifications

**Authors:** Matteo Zatti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01191v1)

**Summary:**

This PhD thesis explores the properties of certain solutions in stringy effective field theories (EFTs) In the context of heterotic string theory (HST), we study $\alpha'$ corrections to well-known black hole solutions. We then consider internal manifolds with non-trivial integer (co)homology and demonstrate how integer homology data can leak into the EFT. We end with AdS$_4$ Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications with localized sources.

## 15. No-hair theorems in General Relativity and scalar-tensor theories

**Authors:** Stoytcho Yazadjiev, Daniela Doneva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01038v1)

**Summary:**

The black hole classification in scalar-tensor theories is much more challenging due to the very complicated character of the field equations. We review most of the known no-hair results, and where possible new ones, as well demonstrate some of the difficulties that appear in our attempts to classify the black holes. The proofs of the theorems and the underlying mathematical techniques are given in sufficient detail. To make the review self-contained we also present the vacuum black hole uniqueness theorem in general relativity and their proofs.
