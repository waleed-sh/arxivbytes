## 0. There is more to the de Sitter horizon than just the area

**Authors:** Willy Fischler, Hare Krishna, Sarah Racz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12097v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12097v1)

**Summary:**

The de Sitter cosmological horizon encodes more information about the bulk spacetime than just the entropy. We show that the horizon contains all of the gauge invariant information about (static albeit unstable) configurations of charged and rotating objects. We study highly symmetric objects, such as dipoles and cubes, built of objects with electric charge and angular momentum at their vertices. These configurations affect the geometry of the horizon and imprint detailed information on the objects in the bulk onto the horizon.

## 1. Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals in gravity: $\varepsilon$-factorized form   for apparent singularities

**Authors:** Hjalte Frellesvig, Roger Morales, Sebastian Pögel, Stefan Weinzierl, Matthias Wilhelm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12057v1)

**Summary:**

We study a recently identified four-loop Feynman integral that contains a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometry. It contributes to the scattering of black holes in classical gravity at fifth post-Minkowskian and second self-force order (5PM 2SF) in the conservative sector. We introduce an appropriate ansatz which allows us to bring such cases into an $\varepsilon$-factorized form. As a proof of principle, we apply it to the integral at hand.

## 2. QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological   Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow

**Authors:** Ning Bao, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Zhihan Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045v1)

**Summary:**

Non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries can be expressed as quantum path integrals in one higher dimension. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS and topological holography.

## 3. Geometrically constrained localized configurations engendering   non-topological profile

**Authors:** D. Bazeia, I. Bezerra, R. Menezes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12044v1)

**Summary:**

This work deals with two real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime. We consider models constructed to engender geometric constrictions. We use them to investigate solutions of the lump type, which attain no topological properties. The results may, in particular, be used to study bright solitons in optical fibers and in Bose-Einstein condensates. It is of current interest in high energy physics and may be used in the future to study high-energy particles.

## 4. The causal structure of the quark propagator

**Authors:** Jan M. Pawlowski, Jonas Wessely

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12033v1)

**Summary:**

We find that the quark propagator features at least two additional pairs of complex conjugate poles. These additional poles lead to violations of causality, if they persist in $S$-matrix elements. We discuss how these additional poles could be avoided in full QCD, where part of chiral symmetry breaking is generated by the other tensor structures in the quarks-gluon vertices. We find a critical vertex strength, below which theQuark has a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation.

## 5. Entanglement Hamiltonian and orthogonal polynomials

**Authors:** Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Riccarda Bonsignori, Viktor Eisler, Gilles Parez, Luc Vinet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12021v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12021v1)

**Summary:**

We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of theEntanglement spectrum and entropy.

## 6. Black hole solutions in theories of supergravity

**Authors:** Tomás Ortín

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12020v1)

**Summary:**

Supergravity has played a very important role in many advances and developments in black hole physics. Here I will review the history of some of the most important developments in the field of supergravity. I will also look at the role played by black holes in the development of the theory of gravity and black holes. I hope that this will help you understand some of these developments better.

## 7. Fuzzy Axions and Associated Relics

**Authors:** Elijah Sheridan, Federico Carta, Naomi Gendler, Mudit Jain, David J. E. Marsh, Liam McAllister, Nicole Righi, Keir K. Rogers, Andreas Schachner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12012v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12012v1)

**Summary:**

We study fuzzy axion dark matter in type IIB string theory, for axions descending from the Ramond-Ramond four-form. We construct a topologically exhaustive ensemble of more than 350,000 Calabi-Yau compactifications yielding up to seven axions. We find that overproduction of heavier axions is problematic, except at special loci in moduli space where decay constant hierarchies can occur. We also give evidence that cosmic birefringence is possible in this setting.

## 8. Celestial Mellin Amplitudes

**Authors:** Francesca Pacifico, Paolo Pergola, Charlotte Sleight

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11992v1)

**Summary:**

Holographic correlators on the celestial sphere of Minkowski space were recently defined in arXiv:2301.01810. We explore the Mellin representation of such celestial correlators. We also discuss the non-perturbative structure of celestial Mellin amplitudes following from the K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral representation of bulk two-point functions. We give various examples in scalar field theories at both tree and loop level, for both massive and massless fields.

## 9. Evidence for the Sombrero Galaxy as an Accelerator of the Highest-Energy   Cosmic Rays

**Authors:** Hao-Ning He, Eiji Kido, Kai-Kai Duan, Yang Yang, Ryo Higuchi, Yi-Zhong Fan, Tao Wang, Lu-Yao Jiang, Rong-Lan Li, Ben-Yang Zhu, Xiang Li, Zi-Qing Xia, Shigehiro Nagataki, Da-Ming Wei, Alexander Kusenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11966v1)

**Summary:**

Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the highest energy messenger from space, with energies exceeding 1 EeV. Pinpointing sources is crucial for understanding the extreme astrophysical processes that accelerate particles to such extraordinary energies. The Sombrero galaxy hosts a supermassive central black hole with a mass of $4.5~\sigma~(3.3~''sigma)$. The finding provides critical evidence on active supermassive black holes as the source of the highest- energy cosmic rays.

## 10. C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory

**Authors:** Yang-Yang Li, Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Yi-Zhuang You

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11958v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11958v1)

**Summary:**

The CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity. We identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT group can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Using domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmeetries across different dimensions. We define the Majorana fermION field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8- fold periodicity.

## 11. Wormholes from beyond

**Authors:** Juliano C. S. Neves

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11947v1)

**Summary:**

In a brane-world context, our universe would be a four-dimensional brane embedded into a five-dimensional spacetime or bulk. In this article, the Morris-Thorne wormhole and the Molina-Neves wormhole are obtained on the brane using the Nakas-Kanti approach. From the bulk perspective, these wormholes are five- dimensional solutions supported by an exotic fluid, but from the branes perspective, such objects are wormholes not supported by any fields or particles that live on the four- dimensional spacetime.

## 12. Harvesting stabilizer entropy and non-locality from a quantum field

**Authors:** S. Cepollaro, S. Cusumano, A. Hamma, G. Lo Giudice, J. Odavic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11918v1)

**Summary:**

The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. We show how to harvest non-stabilizerness, commonly dubbed magic, using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot be erased by local operations. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field unless these resources are already there.

## 13. Demystifying the Massless Sector in AdS_3 Quantum Spectral Curve

**Authors:** Simon Ekhammar, Nikolay Gromov, Bogdan Stefański jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11915v1)

**Summary:**

In the asymptotic large-volume limit, the original proposal for Quantum Spectral Curve for AdS3 x S3 x T4 with R-R flux has a wider class of solutions, than studied previously. We argue that in this limit the QSC reduces to a finite set of Bethe equations for both massive and massless particle types. We also find that the. QSC imposes more constraining conditions on the dressing phases than previously known. and we present solutions of those equations.

## 14. Collinear anatomy

**Authors:** A. V. Belitsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11886v1)

**Summary:**

We study the collinear factorization of off-shell scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (sYM) theory. These are constructed starting from six-dimensional N = (1,1) sYM, taking advantage of an available unconstrained spinor-helicity formalism combined with a unitarity-cut sewing procedure. We then construct off- shell splitting amplitudes directly using the same techniques, establishing equivalence to the amplitude analysis.

## 15. On topological defects in Chern-Simons theory

**Authors:** Alex S. Arvanitakis, Lewis T. Cole, Saskia Demulder, Daniel C. Thompson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11718v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a new class of topological surface defects in Chern-Simons theory with non-compact, non-Abelian gauge groups. These defects are characterized by isotropic subalgebras defined by solutions of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation. From a Hamiltonian perspective, we calculate this fusion using the composition of Lagrangian correspondences within the Weinstein symplectic category. Applications include boundary terms and conditions in $AdS_3$ gravity and higher-spin theories.

## 16. Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: Gravitational Physics from   Scattering Amplitudes

**Authors:** Miguel Correia, Holmfridur S. Hannesdottir, Giulia Isabella, Anna M. Wolz, Zihan Zhou, Mathieu Giroux, Sebastian Mizera, Celina Pasiecznik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11649v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11649v1)

**Summary:**

 lecture notes explain how classical gravitational physics emerges from scattering amplitudes. We emphasize the role of different kinematic regimes in probing various aspects of bound and unbound problems. Classical predictions of General Relativity, such as the Shapiro time delay and perihelion precession, emerge from these considerations. We explain a number of recent approaches to probing black hole physics from the perspective of amplitudes, including applications of worldline effective field theory in astrophysics. These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11--22 March 2024.

## 17. Relativistic Locality from Electromagnetism to Quantum Field Theory

**Authors:** Eugene Y. S. Chua, Charles T. Sebens

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11532v1)

**Summary:**

Electromagnetism is the paradigm case of a theory that satisfies relativistic locality. The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations meet the same standard. We show that this standard can also be applied to quantum field theory (without collapse) We argue that this fundamental locality is compatible with either local or global accounts of the non-fundamental branching of worlds, countering an objection that has been raised to the Sebens-Carroll derivation of the Born Rule from self-locating uncertainty.

## 18. Anyon Condensation in Virasoro TQFT

**Authors:** Shunta Takahashi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11486v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11486v1)

**Summary:**

Anyon condensation in wormhole geometries is investigated in the Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) formulation. We show that VTQFT reproduces semiclassical results, including the Hawking-Page phase transition and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BTZ blackhole. We then summarize a gauging scheme for non-invertible symmetries referred to as anyoncondensation and exhibit that it is applicable to VTQ FT even though the category of Wilson lines associated with it is not strictly a modular tensor category.

## 19. Nonperturbative features in the Lie-algebraic Kähler sigma model with   fermions

**Authors:** Chao-Hsiang Sheu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11444v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the trans-series structure of a quantum mechanical system originating from a Lie-algebraic K\"ahler sigma model with multiple right-handed chiral fermions. We identify and analyze saddle point solutions and examine their contributions within the perturbative expansions of the ground state energy. We explore the role of the elongation parameter and its potential impact on higher-loop corrections, and propose that it becomes relevant in shaping the system's quantum behavior from the three-loop level.
