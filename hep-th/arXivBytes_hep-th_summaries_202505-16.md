## 0. Phantom matters

**Authors:** David Andriot

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10410v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10410v1)

**Summary:**

Cosmological observations of the recent universe suggest that dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is growing with time. Standard quintessence models allow for a varying $w\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w<-1$ is quickly reached in the past. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a coupling of quintessences field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation) We show that this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with string-inspired models.

## 1. Causality and stability of magnetohydrodynamics for an ultrarelativistic   locally neutral two-component gas

**Authors:** Caio V. P. de Brito, Khwahish Kushwah, Gabriel S. Denicol

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10397v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the causality and stability of the relativistic theory of magnetohydrodynamics. We show that this formalism is linearly causal and stable around global equilibrium, for any value of the magnetic field. We discuss the domain of applicability of this type of framework in the context of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. And we compare this framework with the model used in the study of astrophysical plasmas, in which only the longitudinal component of the shear-stress tensor is considered.

## 2. A $T_2 \times R^2$ roadmap to Confinement in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory

**Authors:** Georg Bergner, Antonio González-Arroyo, Ivan Soler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10396v1)

**Summary:**

We study the behaviour of Yang-Mills fields on a $T_2\times R^2$ geometry. We monitor the evolution of the dynamics of the system as a function of the torus size $l_s$. At low densities the string tension takes the standard value of a 2D center-vortex gas, growing with the density and approaching the value measured at infinite volume. Our work includes preliminary studies of the extension to \SU{N} and to the region of large sizes in which boundary conditions are irrelevant.

## 3. Space cannot stretch too {\it fast}

**Authors:** Samir D. Mathur

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10368v1)

**Summary:**

Black holes microstates leave an imprint on the gravitational vacuum through their virtual fluctuations. This imprint yields a power law fall off -- rather than an exponential fall off. This resolution of the information puzzle also implies an extra energy source at the scale of the cosmological horizon. It may explain the mysteries of dark energy and the Hubble tension. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time. It was published by Springer, a division of Springer Group, in association with the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 4. Comparative Study of Indicators of Chaos in the Closed and Open Dicke   Model

**Authors:** Prasad Pawar, Arpan Bhattacharyya, B. Prasanna Venkatesh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10327v1)

**Summary:**

The Dicke model, renowned for its superradiant quantum phase transition (QPT), also exhibits a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics. In this work, we provide a systematic, comparative study of static and dynamical indicators of chaos for the closed and open Dickel model. We find that indicators of Chaos sensitive to long-range correlations in the energy spectrum can deviate from the Poissonian random matrix theory (RMT) predictions and show a dip-ramp-plateau feature even in the normal region.

## 5. Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT   results

**Authors:** Andrea Addazi, Yermek Aldabergenov, Sergei V. Ketov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305v1)

**Summary:**

The pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation. We explore how the higher-order curvature terms modify the inflationary predictions. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinksy model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinski models offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationARY predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.

## 6. Thermal holographic correlators and KMS condition

**Authors:** Ilija Burić, Ivan Gusev, Andrei Parnachev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10277v1)

**Summary:**

 Thermal two-point functions in holographic CFTs receive contributions from two parts. One part comes from the identity, the stress tensor and multi-stress tensors. The other part consists of contributions from double-trace operators. The sum of these two parts must satisfy the KMS condition -- it has to be periodic in Euclidean time. The stress-tensor sector can be computed by analyzing the bulk equations of motions near the AdS boundary and is not periodic by itself.

## 7. Classification of Feynman integral geometries for black-hole scattering   at 5PM order

**Authors:** Daniel Brammer, Hjalte Frellesvig, Roger Morales, Matthias Wilhelm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10274v1)

**Summary:**

We provide a complete classification of the Feynman integral geometries relevant to the scattering of two black holes at fifth order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. The analysis includes integrals relevant to both the conservative and dissipative dynamics, as well as to all orders in the self-force (SF) expansion, i.e. the 0SF, 1SF and 2SF orders. We find that out of the 16,596 potentially contributing integral topologies, only 70 need to be analyzed in detail.

## 8. Quest for a phenomenologically consistent low cutoff theory

**Authors:** Sudhakantha Girmohanta, Yu-Cheng Qiu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10233v1)

**Summary:**

The Randall-Sundrum model with the Higgs localized on the IR brane solves the gauge hierarchy problem. The associated low cutoff generically leads to unacceptably rapid nucleon decay and excessively large Majorana neutrino masses. We demonstrate that eliminating all dangerous operators within a horizontal symmetry framework must come with large and unattractive charge assignments, if possible at all. We consider an exact discrete gauged $\mathbf{Z}_N$ symmetry, with fermion mass hierarchies generated via wavefunction overlap. We employ this to reproduce the current CKM and PMNS structures.

## 9. Correlators of Line Defect and Local Operator in Conformal Field   Theories with a Slightly Broken Higher-Spin Symmetry

**Authors:** Gwenaël Ferrando, Amit Sever, Elior Urisman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10232v1)

**Summary:**

We study three-dimensional conformal field theories with a large-$N$ limit. Leveraging the framework of slightly broken higher-spin symmetry, we bootstrap correlation functions between the single-trace, local operators and straight, conformal line defects with boundaries. These correlation functions, which depend on a single conformal cross-ratio, encapsulate all bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients. We demonstrate that the dependence of these correlators on the defect's shape is fully determined by our bootstrap constraints.

## 10. Gravitational Core of Double Field Theory: Lecture Notes

**Authors:** Jeong-Hyuck Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10163v1)

**Summary:**

Double Field Theory (DFT) has emerged as a comprehensive framework for gravity. It presents a testable and robust alternative to General Relativity (GR) Lecture notes aim to provide an accessible introduction to DFT. Key topics include doubled-yet-gauged coordinates, Riemannian versus non-Riemannians, curvatures, and the Einstein field equation for the closed string massless sector. The lecture notes are structured in a manner similar to traditional GR courses.

## 11. Quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquids: the nonperturbative   renormalization group perspective

**Authors:** Mateusz Homenda, Pawel Jakubczyk, Hiroyuki Yamase

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10140v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a thorough theoretical framework based on the nonperturvative renormalization group (RG) a la Wetterich to tackle the interplay of coupled fermionic and order-parameter fluctuations. We consistently treat the dynamical emergence of the Landau damping of the bosonic mode and non-Fermi liquid scaling of fermions upon lowering the cutoff scale. We demonstrate how results characteristic for the RPA-type fixed-point scaling are recovered in our framework by a questionable procedure.

## 12. Charged wormholes in (anti-)de Sitter spacetime

**Authors:** Hyeong-Chan Kim, Wonwoo Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09981v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09981v1)

**Summary:**

In de Sitter spacetime, two types of wormhole throats can exist. In the anti-de Sitter case, particles traverse the wormhole. We present a family of charged, traversable wormhole solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant. These solutions are shown to be of Petrov type D, and we examine radial geodesics of null and timelike particles. We analyze the flare-out condition, which imposes constraints on the equation of state parameters governing supporting matter.

## 13. Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework   for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables

**Authors:** Farrukh A. Chishtie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947v1)

**Summary:**

Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT) is a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes before perturbative expansion. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment.

## 14. Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix   identities

**Authors:** D. Domanevsky, A. Zotov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918v1)

**Summary:**

We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau and Lifshitz equations. We conclude that the family of models can be used to solve the equations of motion.

## 15. Mutual information and holographic entanglement entropy for   strongly-coupled R-charged plasmas

**Authors:** Gustavo de Oliveira, Ronaldo F. Costa, Lucas C. Celeri, Romulo Rougemont

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09903v1)

**Summary:**

We numerically evaluate, for slab entangling geometries, the mutual information and the holographic entanglement entropy between strongly interacting fields in different spatial regions for two different conformal holographic models at finite temperature and R-charge density. The 1 R-Charge Black Hole (1RCBH) model describes a strongly interacting fluid with a critical point in its phase diagram, while the 2 R- charge Black Hole model has no critical point. In both cases, we find that the mutual Information in the thermodynamically stable branch of black hole solutions is reduced by increasing the value of the dimensionless ratio of R- Charge chemical potential over temperature.

## 16. Two-local modifications of SYK model with quantum chaos

**Authors:** Masanori Hanada, Sam van Leuven, Onur Oktay, Masaki Tezuka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09900v1)

**Summary:**

Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model may provide us with a good starting point for the experimental study of quantum chaos and holography in the laboratory. Still, the four-local interaction of fermions makes quantum simulation challenging, and it would be good to search for simpler models that keep the essence. Simulations of this class of models might be straightforward on qudit-based quantum devices. We study the case of $d=3, 4, 5, 6$ numerically and observe quantum chaos in a wide energy range.

## 17. Background fields in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach

**Authors:** Ivan Dneprov, Maxim Grigoriev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885v1)

**Summary:**

Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDE's whose base spaces are again gaugePDEs describing background fields, as such the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle.

## 18. Measuring the Black Hole Interior from the Exterior

**Authors:** Wu-zhong Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09878v1)

**Summary:**

In this essay, we argue that an observer outside the horizon can reconstruct the geometry of a black hole's interior through external measurements. We propose that this phenomenon reveals a fundamental correlation between the degrees of freedom inside and outside the black hole at the level of classical spacetime. This procedure builds on recent studies of the holographic duality of timelike entanglement entropy and its connection to spacelike Entanglement Entanglements. We conclude that this procedure can be applied to black holes.

## 19. Quantization Rules in Holographic QCD Models

**Authors:** Luiz F. Ferreira, Alfredo Vega

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09866v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09866v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate quasinormal modes in holographic QCD models from the perspective of the WKB approximation. We derive the generalized Bohr Sommerfeld quantization rules for quasi-stationary states. This study provides useful insights into the dissociation process in holog Graphic Q CD models. The study was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Science (JAMAS) on November 14, 2013.
