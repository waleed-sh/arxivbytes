## 0. Renormalizing Two-Fermion Operators in the SMEFT via Supergeometry

**Authors:** Benoît Assi, Andreas Helset, Julie Pagès, Chia-Hsien Shen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18537v1)

**Summary:**

We extend the geometric framework of field-space covariance for loop computations. This unifies the treatment of scalars, fermions, and gauge bosons in effective field theories. We derive a manifestly covariant formula for one-loop UV divergences that includes contributions from mixed boson-fermion graphs. The result is expressed in terms of geometric invariants of the field- space supermanifold. We compute the renormalization group equations for two-ferMion operators at the dimension-eight level in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.

## 1. Inflationary background renormalization

**Authors:** Jason Kristiano, Jun'ichi Yokoyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18514v1)

**Summary:**

In cosmic inflation, non-linearities of the curvature perturbation can induce backreaction to the background. To obtain observational predictions at non- linear order on the correct background, one has to redefine the background or introduce background renormalization. Cancellation of the divergence is a manifestation of Maldacena's consistency condition. The finite term can be large and highly time-dependent, which indicates evolution outside the horizon. It can be used to make observational predictions even at the nonlinear level.

## 2. SymTFT, Protected Gaplessness, and Spontaneous Breaking of   Non-invertible Symmetries

**Authors:** Michele Del Zotto, Azeem Hasan, Elias Riedel Gårding

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18501v1)

**Summary:**

In recent years we have learned that several four-dimensional field theories can manifest non-invertible zero-form symmetries generalizing the Kramers-Wannier duality defect of the 2d critical Ising model. The purpose of this work is to present a first coarse classification of all possible classes of non-Invertible symmetry of this type that can either enforce gaplessness or be spontaneously broken in the infrared exploiting the topological symmetry theory formalism. Along the way we notice the potential for further global structures that could be realized by non-SUSY versions of Argyres-Douglas type fixed points.

## 3. Twists of trigonometric sigma models

**Authors:** Rashad Hamidi, Ben Hoare

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18492v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-twisted trigonometric sigma models, a new class of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model. Starting from 4d Chern-Simons theory on a cylinder, the models are constructed by introducing a branch cut running along the non-compact direction. As a result, the untwisted and twisted models have the same number of degrees of freedom. While twisting does not always lead to inequivalent models, we show that if we use the outer automorphism of a sigma model to twist, then the models have different symmetries.

## 4. Virial theorem for rigidly rotating matter

**Authors:** Sourav Dey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18388v1)

**Summary:**

The scaling property of the thermodynamic free energy of a system at global equilibrium has been examined using a real-time method known as the virial theorem. We demonstrate these scaling properties through a derived relation based on the general structure of equal-time commutators among Poincare charges and their densities. This relation is applicable to any renormalizable fields with spin $leq 1$ excluding gauge fields. These findings are consistent with recent lattice QCD simulation results and estimate the light quark contribution to the total moment of inertia of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)

## 5. On fast charged particles scattering on periodic planes of atoms

**Authors:** V. D. Omelchenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18351v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, the approach for considering fast charged particles scattering on targets of complex structure, which contain some isolated substructures, is introduced. Based on this approach, the differential cross section for scattering on the set of parallel planes with uniformly distributed atoms in each plane is obtained. It is shown that for the case of zero thermal vibrations, the differential scattering cross section may be expressed analytically which simplifies the calculations.

## 6. Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics

**Authors:** Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311v1)

**Summary:**

The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions of the slow modes. In this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT)

## 7. On a lower-dimensional Killing vector origin of irreducible Killing   tensors

**Authors:** Finnian Gray, Gloria Odak, Pavel Krtouš, David Kubizňák

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18287v1)

**Summary:**

In this construction, the key ingredient for irreducibility is the non-commutativity of the underlying Killing vectors. It gives rise to a tower of growing rank Killing tensors determined by the structure constants of the corresponding Lie algebra. A canonical example of a metric with such emergent non-trivial hidden symmetries in all dimensions is provided by rotating (off-shell) generalized Lense-Thirring spacetimes. A physical on-shell realization of this construction in four dimensions is embodied by a rotating black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory.

## 8. Symmetric orbifold OPE from string theory

**Authors:** Vit Sriprachyakul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18244v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18244v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss how to obtain the symmetric orbifold fusion rule/OPE from the dual string theory. We consider two explicit examples: $k_b=3$ bosonic strings in the near-boundary limit and $k=1$ hybrid strings. We show that the OPE of such vertex operators explicitly captures the longest cycle contribution. We then argue how one can obtain the shorter-cycle contributions using the screening operators existing in the theories. We also discuss how our general result reduces to the earlier results in the literature.

## 9. Local symmetry and extended spacetime

**Authors:** Peter West

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18229v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the previously proposed local transformations in E theory have a closing algebra if one adopts a simple constraint on the parameters. We evaluate these local transformations for the decomposition of E11 that leads to the IIA theory at level zero. This has the same fields and spacetime as Siegel theory (Double field theory) but the constraint is different to the generic section conditions used in that theory. We discuss what additional alternative constraints might be required for the invariance of this theory and also argue that the dependence on the coordinates beyond those of the usual spacetime is due to the presence of branes.

## 10. Preparing the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermions on   a quantum computer

**Authors:** Han Xu, Kazuhiro Seki, Seiji Yunoki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18149v1)

**Summary:**

We implement the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermion systems on a quantum computer using a quantum-classical hybrid scheme based on the discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We analyze the success rate both analytically and numerically as a function of the GutZwiller variational parameter $g$ for the Fermi-sea and BCS-like trial states at half filling. The success rate is found to decay exponentially for small $|g|$, but remains finite in the $| g|\to\infty$ limit.

## 11. Entanglement Harvesting from Quantum Field: Insights via the Partner   Formula

**Authors:** Yuki Osawa, Yasusada Nambu, Riku Yoshimoto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18129v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the condition necessary for extracting entanglement from a quantum field. Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between "real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation. We show that Simon'sEntanglement criterion for the bipartite Gaussian state can be reformulated in terms of commutators between the canonical operators of the detector mode B and the partner mode P.

## 12. Lecture Notes on Normalizing Flows for Lattice Quantum Field Theories

**Authors:** Miranda C. N. Cheng, Niki Stratikopoulou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18126v1)

**Summary:**

Numerical simulations of quantum field theories on lattices serve as a fundamental tool for studying the non-perturbative regime of the theories. Challenges arise when one takes the continuum limit or as the system approaches a critical point, especially in the presence of non-trivial topological structures in the theory. Rapid recent advances in machine learning provide a promising avenue for progress in this area. These lecture notes aim to give a brief account of lattice field theories, normalizing flows, and how the latter can be applied to study the former.

## 13. Celestial closed strings at one-loop

**Authors:** Anthonny F. Canazas Garay, Gaston Giribet, Yoel Parra-Cisterna, Francisco Rojas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17989v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17989v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we continue our investigation of superstring scattering amplitudes in the conformal basis. We focus on the case of four graviton scattering processes at 1-loop in \emph{closed} superstring theory. We write the expression for such a process in the celestial variables and confirm previous expectations. This indicates that many of the features satisfied for open string gluon amplitudes at tree and 1- loop levels are also universal properties of graviton celestial amplifyitudes in closed string theory.
