## 0. Generalized entropy of gravitational fluctuations

**Authors:** Sean Colin-Ellerin, Guanda Lin, Geoff Penington

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08308v1)

**Summary:**

The correct treatment of quantum fluctuations of the metric is a longstanding problem. We provide a gauge-invariant prescription for the generalized entropy of gravitons in anti-de Sitter space in terms of areas and bulk entanglement entropy. We identify a class of perturbative graviton states that have parametrically larger generalized entropy than any low-energy excitations of an ordinary quantum field. The results exactly match vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropies for stress-tensor excited states.

## 1. Fluctuating Ensemble Averages and the BTZ Threshold

**Authors:** R. Sammani, E. H Saidi, R. Ahl Laamara, L. B Drissi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08257v1)

**Summary:**

In order to break the emerging global symmetries of the ensemble averaging, one may consider fluctuations away from the average given by deviations in the Siegel-Weil formula. In this work, we investigate the physical interpretation of these fluctuations in the bulk physics and pinpoint the states giving rise to them. We exploit the logarithmic density of states to derive bounds on the charged vectors of the abelian CS symmetry. We establish bounds that allows to distinguish heavy states contributing to the average from light states generating fluctuations around it.

## 2. Quantum-Corrected Hawking Radiation from Near-Extremal Kerr-Newman Black   Holes

**Authors:** Sabyasachi Maulik, Xin Meng, Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08252v1)

**Summary:**

Near-extremal black holes have a long AdS$_2$ throat in their near-horizon region. Quantum fluctuations in the throat region are effectively governed by a quantum version of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with matter and are strongly coupled at low temperatures. We investigate how these quantum fluctuations affect the spectrum of emission of particles during Hawking radiation. We find that for particles with non-vanishing angular momentum, the quantum-corrected emission can be substantially enhanced with respect to the standard semiclassical result.

## 3. Soliton Resonances in Four Dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten Model

**Authors:** Shangshuai Li, Masashi Hamanaka, Shan-Chi Huang, Da-Jun Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08250v1)

**Summary:**

We present two kinds of resonance soliton solutions for the G=U(2) Yang equation. We reveal and illustrate the solitonic behaviors in four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW$_4$) model. The V-shape solitons suggest annihilation and creation process of twosolitons. We also clarify the relationship between the Cauchy matrix approach and the binary Darboux transformation in terms of quasideterminants.

## 4. Birefringence in fermion-attenuated gravitational wave power spectrum

**Authors:** Jinglong Liu, Stephon Alexander, Antonino Marciano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08240v1)

**Summary:**

Chern-Simons gravity is a theory that dynamically violates parity. We analyze the power spectrum of gravitational waves in light of the damping effect due to the free streaming relativistic neutrinos and dark fermions. We predict a falsifiable pattern of observable peaks and dips in the chiral independent gravitational power spectrum, eventually observable in next space-borne gravitational interferometers, including LISA, Taiji and Tianqin. Our result represents a useful tool to test Chern-SimONS gravity and enables to constrain mechanisms of inflation and reheating related to this theory.

## 5. EFT & Species Scale: Friends or foes?

**Authors:** Bruno Valeixo Bento, João Melo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08230v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08230v1)

**Summary:**

The notion that quantum gravity effects could manifest at scales much lower than the Planck scale has seen an intense Swamplandish revival. Dozens of works have explored how the so-called species scale -- at which an effective description of gravity must break down -- relates to String Theory. In this work we take an EFT point-of-view and provide a detailed perturbative derivation of the species scale by computing the 1-loop graviton propagator in the presence of many fields. Not only do we clarify the setup, assumptions and regimes of validity of the result, but more importantly apply the same methods to an infinite tower of states.

## 6. Taking the amplituhedron to the limit

**Authors:** Joris Koefler, Rainer Sinn

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08221v1)

**Summary:**

The limit amplituhedron is a positive geometry with a residual arrangement that is empty. We determine its algebraic boundary in terms of Chow hypersurfaces. This hypersurface in the Grassmannian is stratified by singularities. In conclusion, we show that the limit Amplituhedron has an empty residual arrangement and is a non-negative geometry with no negative helcity particles. It is the limit of the Grassmanian under a linear map subject to a choice of additional parameters.

## 7. Background subtraction method is as applicable as convariant counterterm   method, but much simpler

**Authors:** Wei Guo, Xiyao Guo, Xin Lan, Hongbao Zhang, Wei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08214v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the background subtraction method is applicable not only to Einstein's gravity, but also to its higher derivative corrections for black holes in both asympotically flat and AdS spacetimes. As a bonus, we also obtain the corresponding expression of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the Euclidean on-shell action. This can be regarded as the first proof of such a relation, which has been assumed to be also valid beyond Einstein'sgravity without derivation before.

## 8. Mixed State Entanglement Entropy in CFT

**Authors:** Xin Jiang, Houwen Wu, Peng Wang, Haitang Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08198v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08198v1)

**Summary:**

The entanglement entropy between two subsystems for a mixed state has remained an important problem. We provide a straightforward method, namely the subtraction approach, to solve this problem for generic covariant bipartite mixed states. We show that $S_\text{vN}$ exactly matches the corresponding entanglements wedge cross section in the AdS bulk, respectively. We further demonstrate that the mixed stateEntanglement Entanglement Ego can be calculated in a more abstract yet powerful way.

## 9. Emission of $W$ bosons by electrons and decays of $W$ bosons in the   early universe

**Authors:** Amalia Dariana Fodor, Cosmin Crucean

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08113v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08113v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study the transition rates for the decay of $W^{\pm}$ bosons into leptons in de Sitter spacetime. We recover the Minkowski limits of the transition rate. We also study the emission of $ W^{\ pm}$bosons by lepton, a process which is possible only in the large expansion conditions of the early universe. These results are obtainable due to perturbative methods which allow us to compute the transition amplitudes in first order of perturbation theory.

## 10. Instanton Corrections to the MSTB Kink Mass

**Authors:** Jarah Evslin, Alberto García Martín-Caro, Andrzej Wereszczyński

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08034v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08034v1)

**Summary:**

The Montonen-Sarker-Trullinger-Bishop model enjoys two classically degenerate kink solutions in the same topological sector. We argue that the two lowest lying Hamiltonian eigenstates in the kink sector of the corresponding quantum theory correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of coherent states localized at these two solutions. We use the instanton gas approximation to provide a simple, analytic formula for the leading contribution to the mass splitting between these two states.

## 11. Tidal Love Numbers of Neutron Stars in Horndeski Theories

**Authors:** Robin Fynn Diedrichs, Shinji Tsujikawa, Kent Yagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07998v1)

**Summary:**

In scalar-tensor theories, one typically finds new types of Love numbers that are usually not considered or simply absent in General Relativity. We present the linear perturbation equations necessary to calculate static and even-parity tidal Love numbers in Horndeski theories. We further focus on the quadrupolar Love numbers and demonstrate how these can be extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the perturbative fields. We find that the Love numbers can differ by $1/r^3$ if this additional contribution is not taken into account.

## 12. Exotic massive fermionic systems with huge vacuum degeneracy at   boundaries

**Authors:** Hiroki Kawakami, Satoshi Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07935v1)

**Summary:**

When the mass parameter is set to zero, the system acquires the fermionic subsystem symmetry. Introducing the mass term explicitly breaks this symmetry, resulting in a trivially gapped system in the absence of boundaries. We demonstrate that with the introduction of boundaries,. the system remains gapped, but it has a huge vacuum degeneracy. The residual entropy is proportional to the area of the boundary, and the entropy of the system increases with the number of boundaries introduced. We present our results in a paper published in the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 13. Covariant analysis of electromagnetic current on the light cone:   exposition with scalar Yukawa theory

**Authors:** Wenyu Zhang, Yang Li, James P. Vary

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07826v1)

**Summary:**

We present the first systematic investigation of the Lorentz covariance of the charge form factor for a strongly coupled scalar theory in (3+1)-dimensions. Our results are based on the non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa theory with a Fock sector expansion including up to thee-particles. As more Fock sectors are included, the frame dependence reduces dramatically. In particular, the anti-nucleon degree of freedom plays an important role in the reduction of the frame dependent.

## 14. Hall Angle of a Spatially Random Vector Model

**Authors:** Yi-Li Wang, Young-Kwon Han, Xian-Hui Ge, Sang-Jin Sin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07792v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07792v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the physics of the spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and a vector bosonic field. We evaluated the propagators of the fermion and vector as well as the self energy and polarization. We also evaluated the temperature dependence of the Hall angle. No strange-metal behaviour is obtained, but the linear-$T$ resistivity is preserved under the magnetic field. The results were published in the Journal of Magnetic Theory and Theory of Magnetic Fields, published by the University of California, San Diego.

## 15. SymSETs and self-dualities under gauging non-invertible symmetries

**Authors:** Da-Chuan Lu, Zhengdi Sun, Zipei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07787v1)

**Summary:**

The self-duality defects under discrete gauging in a categorical symmetry can be classified by inequivalent ways of enriching the bulk SymTFT. The resulting Symmetry Enriched Topological (SET) orders will be referred to as $\textit{SymSETs}$ We provide a direct construction of the SymSET from a given duality defect using its $F$-symbols. We show explicitly that changing fractionalization classes can change fusion rules of theDuality defect.

## 16. Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries

**Authors:** Yuji Hirono, Kohei Kamada, Naoki Yamamoto, Ryo Yokokura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. We show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetry can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-Equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems, the authors say. The study was published in the Journal of Applied Physics.

## 17. Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons

**Authors:** Wei-Yang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07776v1)

**Summary:**

This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values. We generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid (IL) ensemble.
