## 0. One-loop renormalization of the effective field theory of inflationary   fluctuations from gravitational interactions

**Authors:** Matteo Braglia, Lucas Pinol

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07926v1)

**Summary:**

We study one-loop corrections to primordial power spectra generated during cosmic inflation from gravitational nonlinear interactions. In the realm of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of inflationary fluctuations, we renormalize the quadratic Lagrangian dictating the linear dynamics of gauge-invariant perturbations. We show that time-dependent Ultra-Violet (UV) divergences appearing at the loop level can be canceled at all times. We discuss a first application to multifield inflation.

## 1. Exploring Structure Constants in Planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM: From   Small Spin to Strong Coupling

**Authors:** Benjamin Basso, Alessandro Georgoudis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07922v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07922v1)

**Summary:**

We study the structure constants of two conformal primary operators and one spinning operator in planar Super-Yang-Mills theory. We derive a formula for computing these structure constants at any coupling in the small-spin limit, up to a normalization factor. This formula allows us to explore their analytical properties at strong coupling. We extend our analysis to finite-spin operators, verifying recent two-loop results for structure constants in string theory and generalizing them to operators with arbitrary R-charges.

## 2. Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit of axisymmetric   spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes

**Authors:** Takahisa Igata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static, axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects. We also express these coefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 3. Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves

**Authors:** E. Babichev, I. Dankovsky, D. Gorbunov, S. Ramazanov, A. Vikman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902v1)

**Summary:**

We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar. A $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_bias$ is suppressed compared to naive expectations.

## 4. Gauge and parametrization dependence of Quantum Einstein Gravity within   the Proper Time flow

**Authors:** Alfio Bonanno, Giovanni Oglialoro, Dario Zappalà

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07877v1)

**Summary:**

Proper time functional flow equations have garnered significant attention in recent years. By resorting to this flow, we investigate the regulator and gauge dependence in quantum Einstein gravity. Our findings indicate that some details of the regulator have minor influence on the critical properties of the theory. In contrast, the selection between linear and exponential parametrizations appears to have a more substantial impact on the scaling behavior of the renormalized flow near the non-Gaussian fixed point. The study was published in the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 5. Resummation of Universal Tails in Gravitational Waveforms

**Authors:** Mikhail M. Ivanov, Yue-Zhou Li, Julio Parra-Martinez, Zihan Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07862v1)

**Summary:**

We present a formula for the universal anomalous scaling of the multipole moments of a generic gravitating source in classical general relativity. We use the absorption of low frequency gravitational waves by a black hole to identify the total multipole scaling dimension. We propose a novel resummation of the universal short-distance logarithms (''tails'') in the gravitational waveform of binary systems, which may improve the modeling of signals from current and future gravitational wave experiments. The universality of the point-particle effective description of compact gravitating systems further allows us to extract the universal part of the anomalous dimension.

## 6. Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a   non-zero potential

**Authors:** Gabriel I. Róis, José Tarciso S. S. Junior, Francisco S. N. Lobo, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861v1)

**Summary:**

In-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity, such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. The analysis uncovers a range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case.

## 7. Signatures of NED on Quasi periodic Oscillations of a Magnetically   Charged Black Hole

**Authors:** Bidyut Hazarika, Mrinnoy M. Gohain, Prabwal Phukon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole. Starting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular orbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find that as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards the Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies.

## 8. Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the   Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture

**Authors:** Chunyu Li, Junkai Wang, Dongdong Zhang, Emmanuel N. Saridakis, Yi-Fu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791v1)

**Summary:**

Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration. Our findings imply that viable dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.

## 9. Singularity resolution and inflation from an infinite tower of   regularized curvature corrections

**Authors:** Pedro G. S. Fernandes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07692v1)

**Summary:**

We explore four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories obtained from well-defined dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. When an infinite tower of corrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in which the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the early-universe. They also admit a specific class of regular black hole solutions. We present our results in a paper published in the Journal of Theoretical Physics. For more information, visit www.jph.org.
