## 0. Krylov spread complexity as holographic complexity beyond JT gravity

**Authors:** Michal P. Heller, Jacopo Papalini, Tim Schuhmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17785v1)

**Summary:**

The Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature is the only quantitative match to the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. We propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. We comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov Spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scales SYK and sine, dilaton, gravity.

## 1. High-Energy Fixed-Angle Meson Scattering and the Constituent Counting   Rule in Holographic QCD

**Authors:** Adi Armoni, Bartosz Pyszkowski, Shigeki Sugimoto, Dorin Weissman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17784v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17784v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the high-energy fixed-angle scattering of pions and $\rho$-mesons in a bottom-up holographic QCD model. To this end, we generalise the approach of Polchinski and Strassler arXiv:hep-th/0109174 to write an ansatz for meson scattering amplitudes. We demonstrate that our generalisation is necessary to describe the Nambu--Goldstone boson equivalence theorem. Our results are in agreement with the constituent counting rule found in QCD.

## 2. Variational Quantum Simulation of Anyonic Chains

**Authors:** Ananda Roy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17781v1)

**Summary:**

Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field theories in two space-time dimensions. They play a central role in the investigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and numerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a quantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains which can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester. The scheme is benchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$ family.

## 3. The Fractional Hall hierarchy from duality

**Authors:** Kristan Jensen, Amir Raz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17761v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17761v1)

**Summary:**

A modified version of Son's Dirac composite fermion theory proposed by Seiberg et al gives a candidate unified description of the gapped and gapless fractional quantum Hall states within a single Landau level. The gapped states include odd-denominator filling fraction states with an abelian Chern-Simons description. The critical points exist at even denominator filling and are well-described by a Fermi surface. This construction is the Lagrangian, or effective field theory, analogue of the flux attachment procedure.

## 4. A Conformal Approach to Carroll Gravity

**Authors:** Eric A. Bergshoeff, Patrick Concha, Octavio Fierro, Evelyn Rodríguez, Jan Rosseel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17752v1)

**Summary:**

We show how to take the first step in the conformal program for constructing general matter couplings to Carroll gravity. In particular, we couple a single massless electric/magnetic scalar to conformal Carroll gravity with isotropic dilatations and show how, upon gauge-fixing, we obtain a (non-conformal version of) electric/Magnetic Carrollgravity. We determine the full Carroll transformation rules paying special attention to the way the so-called intrinsic torsion tensors occur.

## 5. A note on partially massless supergravity

**Authors:** Nicolas Boulanger, Guillaume Lhost, Sylvain Thomée

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17713v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the couplings of a partially massless spin-2 field with a doublet of massless, real spin-3/2 fields. We show that the corresponding non-Abelian gauge algebra closely resembles the one of supergravity around anti-de Sitter spacetime AdS$_4$. The gauge-algebra deformation is however obstructed, at next order. We argue that the two problems encountered are simultaneously solved by the adjunction of the masseless graviton.

## 6. Gravitational algebras and applications to nonequilibrium physics

**Authors:** Michele Cirafici

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17674v1)

**Summary:**

This note aims to offer a non-technical and self-contained introduction to gravitational algebras and their applications in the nonequilibrium physics of gravitational systems. We begin by presenting foundational concepts from operator algebra theory and exploring their relevance to perturbative quantum gravity. We focus on entropy production in black hole backgrounds and fluctuation theorems in de Sitter spacetime. We provide a brief overview of the theory of nonequ equilibrium dynamical systems in finite dimensions and discuss its generalization.

## 7. Fractional Hydrodynamic Transport from the Witten Anomaly

**Authors:** Joe Davighi, Nakarin Lohitsiri, Napat Poovuttikul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17650v1)

**Summary:**

We study the physical consequences of 't Hooft anomalies in the high-temperature limit of relativistic quantum field theories with $SU(2)$, or more generally $USp(2N)$, global symmetry. The global anomaly afflicting these symmetry groups results in new transport phenomena akin to the chiral magnetic and chiral vortical effect. We predict conductivities that are fractionally quantised in units of a half, reflecting the 2-torsion in the bordism groups.

## 8. The quantum $p$-spin renormalization group in the large $N$ limit as a   benchmark for functional renormalization group

**Authors:** Vincent Lahoche, Dine Ousmane Samary, Parham Radpay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17600v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17600v1)

**Summary:**

This paper examines the dynamics of the $N$- vector through the framework of renormalization group theory. First, we focus on perturbation theory, which is more suitable than nonperturbative techniques due to the specific temporal non-locality of the model after disorder integration. We extend our analysis beyond the symmetric phase by using an expansion around the vacuum of the local potential. Our numerical investigations particularly focus on the cases $p = 2$ and $p=3$.

## 9. Closed-string amplitude recursions from the Deligne associator

**Authors:** Konstantin Baune, Johannes Broedel, Federico Zerbini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17579v1)

**Summary:**

Close-string analogues of Selberg integrals satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for a suitable matrix representation of the free Lie algebra on two generators. Limits at z=1 and z=0, which are related by the Deligne associator, with N-point and (N-1)-point closed-string amplitudes, respectively. The results are consistent with earlier results on recursions for open-string tree-level amplitudes.

## 10. Infrared properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)/H$ nonlinear   $σ$ models at nonzero $θ$ angles

**Authors:** Philippe Lecheminant, Yuya Tanizaki, Keisuke Totsuka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17493v1)

**Summary:**

A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the Grassmannian nonlinear $N >2$ models at $theta=\pi$.

## 11. The spectrum of defect ABJM theory

**Authors:** Charlotte Kristjansen, Xin Qian, Chenliang Su

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17479v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17479v1)

**Summary:**

We determine the spectrum of quantum fluctuations in a 1/2-BPS domain wall version of ABJM theory. This enables the perturbative exploration of the corresponding defect CFT. As expected, the spectrum reflects the supersymmetry of the model. We conclude that the spectrum is consistent with the theory of supersymmetric quantum fluctuations. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal (ASJ) (http://www.astrophysicaljournal.com/ASJ/2013/01/07/astrophysics-journal.html#storylink=cpy).

## 12. Solar system tests in covariant f(Q) gravity

**Authors:** Wenyi Wang, Kun Hu, Taishi Katsuragawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17463v1)

**Summary:**

We study the Solar System constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity. We investigate the perihelion precession, light deflection, Shapiro delay, Cassini constraint, and gravitational redshift. We place bounds on the parameter $\alpha$ with $n=2, 3$ in our model of $f('Q')$ gravity, using various observational data in the solar system. We conclude that $f'Q' is a model of gravity with a higher nonmetricity-scalar correction.

## 13. Deuteron gravitational form factors, generalized parton distributions,   and charge density in the framework of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model

**Authors:** Shahin Mamedov, Minaya Allahverdiyeva, Narmin Akbarova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17407v1)

**Summary:**

We study the deuteron gravitational form factors (GFFs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) within the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. GPDs and charge density are considered in impact parameter (IP) space and at zero and finite temperatures. We plot the temperature dependence of these quantities in IP space and observe a decreasing of their peaks on temperature increasing. The gravitational root means squared radius obtained here is close to the range given by experimental data for the mass radius.

## 14. Neutrinos: Opening new doors

**Authors:** Francesco Vissani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17277v1)

**Summary:**

In this contribution, I discuss the value of the concepts of interdisciplinarity and innovation for neutrino physics. The importance of a harmonious relationship between theoretical elaborations and experiments emerges. The discussion highlights also the need to proceed armed with a patience, a virtue that Feynman himself indicated as essential to science. It is all the more necessary when investigating interesting but elusive particles such as neutrinos. The contribution is part of the "Crossing the Portal" session of the NOW 2024 meeting.

## 15. Super volumes and KdV tau functions

**Authors:** Alexander Alexandrov, Paul Norbury

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17272v1)

**Summary:**

Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of curves are deeply related to the Kontsevich-Witten KdV tau function. They possess a Virasoro symmetry which comes out of recursion relations between the volumes due to Mirzakhani. We prove that by also allowing Ramond punctures, the super Weil-petersson. volumes are related to a generalised BGW Kdv tau. function. This allows us to prove that these new super volumes also satisfy the Stanford-witten recursion.

## 16. Meson correlators in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and hints for 8d   structures at weak coupling

**Authors:** Xi-Er Du, Zhongjie Huang, Bo Wang, Ellis Ye Yuan, Xinan Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17260v1)

**Summary:**

We study correlators of $n$-point meson correlators with arbitrary operator dimensions. We show that these corrections can be resumed into generating functions which exhibit emergent 8d structures similar to the ones previously observed at strong coupling via AdS/CFT. These structures of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories also resemble the hidden 10d structures in 4d SYM. We focus on the weakly coupled regime and obtain one-loop corrections to $n $-point correlators.

## 17. Heavy-quark mass relation from a standard-model boson operator   representation in terms of fermions

**Authors:** Jaime Besprosvany, Rebeca Sánchez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17221v1)

**Summary:**

The standard-model can be equivalently represented with its fields in a spin-extended basis, departing from fermion degrees of freedom. The common Higgs operator connects the electroweak and Yukawa sectors, restricting the top and bottom quark masses. Using second quantization, within the heavy-particle sector, electroweak vectors, the Higgs field, and symmetry operators are expanded in terms of bilinear combinations of top andbottom quark operators. This is interpreted as either a basis choice or as a description of composite models.

## 18. Local symmetries and extensive ground-state degeneracy of a 1D   supersymmetric fermionic chain

**Authors:** Shuyu Zhang, Hiroki Sukeno, Kazuki Ikeda, Tzu-Chieh Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17208v1)

**Summary:**

We study a $1$D supersymmetric (SUSY) hard-core fermion model first proposed by Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer. Exact diagonalization shows the degeneracy of zero-energy states scales exponentially with size of the system. We also provide an explicit mapping between ground states, giving a combinatorial explanation of the recurrence relation. We show the ground states can be systematically constructed by inserting immobile walls of fermions into the chain.

## 19. Poisson electrodynamics on $κ$-Minkowski space-time

**Authors:** O. Abla, M. J. Neves

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17202v1)

**Summary:**

Poisson electrodynamics is the semi-classical limit of $U(1)$ non-commutative gauge theory. The interaction arises from the construction of a gauge-invariant action. Using the field solutions, we find the second-order equation for the deformed Lorentz force. This suggests possible effects of an emergent gravity due to non-Commutativity. It is the first study to use a point-like charged particle interacting with the Poisson gauge field.
