## 0. De Sitter entropy: on-shell versus off-shell

**Authors:** Dmitrii Diakonov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01942v1)

**Summary:**

For pure gravity, the bulk entropy computed on-shell as a volume integral in de Sitter space coincides with the Wald entropy (area law) in any spacetime dimension and for any theory of f(R) gravity. We extend this result to the renormalized entanglement entropy of a non-minimally coupled scalar field. From the on- shell perspective, entropy emerges as a bulk contribution, whereas from the off-shell viewpoint, it manifests as a boundary (horizon) contribution.

## 1. A Dilaton Sum Rule for the Conformal Anomaly Form Factor in QCD at Order   $α_s$

**Authors:** Claudio Corianò, Stefano Lionetti, Dario Melle, Leonardo Torcellini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01904v1)

**Summary:**

We present an off-shell dispersive analysis of the graviton-gluon-Gluon interaction. We show that it satisfies a conformal anomaly sum rule at one-loop, under the most general kinematical conditions. The perturbative analysis indicates that sum rules are central dynamical features of anomaly interactions. The coupling or the decoupling of the associated dilaton poles are correlated with the saturation of the sum rule either by a pole or by a dispersive cut.

## 2. Is Lorentz invariance violation found?

**Authors:** Giorgio Galanti, Marco Roncadelli, Fabrizio Tavecchio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01830v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01830v1)

**Summary:**

Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration. The Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist.

## 3. Energy Density Functional of Confined Quarks: an Improved Ansatz

**Authors:** Udita Shukla, Pok Man Lo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01814v1)

**Summary:**

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a robust framework for modeling interacting many-body systems. Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. Our findings reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction. The results are published in the journal Density Functional theory.

## 4. $\mathbf{γ^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}}$   helicity amplitudes and transition form factors

**Authors:** Luis Albino, Gustavo Paredes-Torres, Khepani Raya, Adnan Bashir, Jorge Segovia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01770v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01770v1)

**Summary:**

We recently reported new results on the transition form factors using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector contact interaction (SCI) The results show reasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities. However, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a sharper variation than theoretical predictions. We anticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI framework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and QCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and contributions of scalar and vector diquarks.

## 5. Isospin asymmetry and neutron stars in V-QCD

**Authors:** Lorenzo Bartolini, Sven Bjarke Gudnason, Matti Järvinen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01758v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01758v1)

**Summary:**

Isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is introduced to V-QCD, a bottom-up holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model. Using a small isospin chemical potential we extract the symmetry energy in the model, finding excellent agreement with experimental results for some of the potentials. We construct beta-equilibrated neutron stars via the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations. We find, pleasingly, that the neutron stars passing the mass/radius and tidal deformability constraints are those with potentials that also lead to excellent symmetry energies.

## 6. Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions   and boundary

**Authors:** I. V. Anikin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744v1)

**Summary:**

An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courand-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverseRadon transforms.

## 7. Fluid and scalar field representations in the Brans-Dicke theory:   cosmological scenarios

**Authors:** Tiago H. B. Alves, Júlio C. Fabris, Luiz Filipe Guimarães

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01710v1)

**Summary:**

The Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor cosmological models are studied in both Einstein and Jordan frames. The main features of the corresponding cosmologically scenarios are determined. In many cases, we identify a transition from decelerated to accelerated regimes. The properties of the self-interacting scalar field, including the corresponding potential, are also determined. Finally, some possible realistic configurations are analyzed to identify some possible scenarios for the models to be considered in the future.

## 8. Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with   time-dependent constraints

**Authors:** Adam Stokes, Ahsan Nazir

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01680v1)

**Summary:**

Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. We show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status. We reaffirm the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys.Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021)

## 9. Copositive geometry of Feynman integrals

**Authors:** Bernd Sturmfels, Máté L. Telek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01628v1)

**Summary:**

Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the Copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the coposive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feyn man graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.

## 10. Why many-partite entanglement is essential for holography

**Authors:** Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin, Mitsuhiro Nishida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01625v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01625v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that many-partite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography and holographic quantum error correction codes. We base our claim on genuine multi-entropy, a new measure for multi-partites. We also discuss a connection between the bulk IR reconstruction and many- partite entangling on a large number of boundary subregions. We conclude that holographic holograms can be used to predict the future of the universe in the form of holographic superambient states.

## 11. Higgs-Modular Inflation

**Authors:** Shuntaro Aoki, Hajime Otsuka, Ryota Yanagita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01622v1)

**Summary:**

The Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system. Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. We discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs fields.

## 12. Black hole solutions in quantum phenomenological gravitational dynamics

**Authors:** Ana Alonso-Serrano, Marco de Cesare, Manuel Del Piano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01539v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01539v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate black hole solutions within a phenomenological approach to quantum gravity based on spacetime thermodynamics. The field equations are traceless, similarly to unimodular gravity, and include quadratic curvature corrections. We find that static, spherically symmetric, vacuum spacetimes in this theory split into two branches. We analyze the dynamics of first-order metric perturbations on both branches, showing that there are no deviations from unimodularity gravity at this level.

## 13. Global variants of $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theories and Calogero-Moser systems

**Authors:** Jeremías Aguilera Damia, Riccardo Argurio, Antoine Bourget, Valdo Tatitscheff, Romain Vandepopeliere

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01502v1)

**Summary:**

Global variants of four-dimensional gauge theories are specified by their spectrum of genuine Wilson-'t Hooft line operators. We focus on theories of type $A$ and $B_2$ which are closely connected to twisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems. We elucidate the implications for the structure of gapped vacua, the emergent (generalized) symmetries realized in each vacuum, and the action of spontaneously broken modular invariance. We establish, on general grounds, how this gauge-theoretic topological data manifests itself on the integrable system side.

## 14. Causal chiral 2-form electrodynamics

**Authors:** Jorge G. Russo, Paul K. Townsend

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01467v1)

**Summary:**

 Generic nonlinear theories of chiral 2-form electrodynamics allow superluminal propagation in some stationary homogeneous backgrounds. We find a simple parameterisation of the subclass of causal theories. We show that causality implies both the Dominant and Strong energy conditions. We also revisit the Perry-Schwarz formulation, clarifying aspects of it and of its relation to the Hamiltonian formulation. We conclude that the theories are acausal and can be used to develop new theories.

## 15. Interacting $p$-form gauge theories: New developments

**Authors:** Sergei M. Kuzenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01421v1)

**Summary:**

Gauge $p$-forms in diverse dimensions are ubiquitous in supergravity and string theory. This work reviews novel covariant formulations designed to generate arbitrary interacting duality-invariant or chiral (self-dual) $p $-form theories in $d = 2p + 2$ space-time dimensions. We provide a complete description of $T\bar T$-like deformations of models for nonlinear electrodynamics in four dimensions and their six-dimensional counterparts.

## 16. Local conformal symmetry and anomalies with antisymmetric tensor field

**Authors:** Ilya L. Shapiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01340v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the trace anomaly, which results from the integration of the massless conformal fermion field with the background of metric and antisymmetric tensor fields. The non-local terms in the anomaly-induced effective action do not depend on the scheme of quantum calculations. On the other hand, total derivative terms in. the anomaly and the corresponding local part of the induced action manifest scheme dependence and multiplicative. anomaly. We present our results in a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal.

## 17. Metrics over multi-parameter AdS vacua

**Authors:** Eran Palti, Nicolò Petri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01316v1)

**Summary:**

We study the notion of a distance between different AdS vacua of string theory. The distance is measured by a metric that is derived by taking an off-shell quadratic variation of the effective action, and evaluating it over families of vacua. We find that the metric is flat and positive, and so yields a well-defined distance along any path in the space of solutions. We calculate this metric for increasingly complex families of Vacua and find it is flat only on non-compact directions.

## 18. Graviton Scattering on Gravitational Atoms: Relic Graviton Shot Noise

**Authors:** Benjamin Avila-Lopez, Richard MacKenzie, Fernando Mendez, M. B. Paranjape

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01286v1)

**Summary:**

Study the scattering of a graviton on a gravitational atom. Total absorption cross section is universal, independent of the mass of the gravitationally bound particle. We speculate about the potential for detection of relic gravitons shot noise. The study was published in the Journal of Theoretical Astrophysics, volume 2, pages 1-3.

## 19. Bounds on dilaton and complex structure moduli values for perturbative   control

**Authors:** Min-Seok Seo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01268v1)

**Summary:**

String compactification in the framework of the low energy effective supergravity requires the perturbative control in both the large volume and the weak coupling expansions. The corrected K\"ahler potential generated by the coupling of the dilaton (complex structure moduli) to some lattice structure may diverge in the large field limit. Such a divergence may not be affected by the symmetry breaking by, for example, the gauge fields in the brane. The Kaluza-Klein and the string mass scales are determined by the volume of the internal manifold.
