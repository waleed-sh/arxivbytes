## 0. Generating particle physics Lagrangians with transformers

**Authors:** Yong Sheng Koay, Rikard Enberg, Stefano Moretti, Eliel Camargo-Molina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09729v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09729v1)

**Summary:**

In physics, Lagrangians provide a systematic way to describe laws governing physical systems. In the context of particle physics, they encode the interactions and behavior of the fundamental building blocks of our universe. We trained a transformer model -- proven to be effective in natural language tasks -- to predict the Lagrangian corresponding to a given list of particles. We show through an analysis of input embeddings that the model has internalized concepts such as group representations and conjugation operations as it learned to generate Lagrangeians.

## 1. Running EFT-hedron with null constraints at loop level

**Authors:** Guangzhuo Peng, Long-Qi Shao, Anna Tokareva, Yongjun Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09717v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum field theory has constraints on the couplings of the effective field theory (EFT) coefficients. These constraints follow from the connections between the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) theory. In this work, we extend the scope of positivity bounds including one-loop amplitudes, which is essential especially for the loops of massless particles. We found that an upper bound on dimension-8 coupling becomes significantly stronger, and the dimension-12 coupling can be slightly negative which was thought to be forbidden.

## 2. A Unified View of Vacuum Decay Channels

**Authors:** J. R. Espinosa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09714v1)

**Summary:**

The tunneling potential formalism offers in a natural way a unified view of vacuum decays. In particular, I show in this talk how Coleman's bounce is just a member of a continuous family of solutions that can also feature Hawking-Moss instantons, pseudo-bounces and bubble-of-nothing solutions. It is an alternative to the standard Coleman Euclidean approach, which is based on the idea that the universe is made up of a series of sub-atomic particles.

## 3. Finite-time Unruh effect: Waiting for the transient effects to fade off

**Authors:** D. Jaffino Stargen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09676v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the transition probability rate of a Unruh-DeWitt (UD) detector interacting with massless scalar field for a finite duration of proper time, $T$ of the detector. For a UD detector moving at a uniform acceleration, $a$, we explicitly show that the finite-time transition probability rates can be written as a sum of purely thermal terms, and non-thermal transient terms. We comment on the possibilities of bringing down the exponentially large thermalization time at small accelerations, $ a\ll\Delta E$.

## 4. Chern-Simons gravitational term coupled to an isocurvature field

**Authors:** Giorgio Orlando

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09630v1)

**Summary:**

The Chern-Simons gravitational term during inflation is usually coupled to the inflaton field. The resulting theory suffers from ghost-field formation in the tensor sector. We show that combining these couplings with interactions between the curvature and isocurvature components coming from a turning trajectory, the resulting non-Gaussianities can reach $f^{sst, PV}_{\rm NL}=B_{PV}^{\zeta\zeta h}(k,k, k)$

## 5. Twistorial chiral algebras in higher dimensions

**Authors:** Tim Adamo, Iustin Surubaru

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09627v1)

**Summary:**

In four spacetime dimensions, the classically integrable self-dual sectors of gauge theory and gravity have associated chiral algebras. These emerge naturally from their description in twistor space. Using twistor sigma models to describe these sectors, we demonstrate that they also arise as soft symmetry algebraes under a certain notion of collinear limit. We show that there are similar chiralAlgebra associated to integrables sectors of gravity and gauge theory in $4m$-dimensions.

## 6. Gravitational waves and dark matter with Witten effect

**Authors:** Ruiyu Zhou, Ligong Bian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09596v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the breaking of dark $SU(2)_d$ symmetry at different temperature scales. We focus on assessing the potential of the hidden monopoles generated during this process to serve as dark matter candidate. We examine the impact of axion-monopole interactions on the axion mass. The stochastic gravitational wave background generated by dark phase transition and axionic domain wall collapse may offer a potential explanation for the low-frequency gravitational wave signals observed in PTA experiments. The contribution of monopoles to theAxion mass through witten effect becomes non-negligible.

## 7. Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral   spin liquids

**Authors:** Tong Liu, Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Tao Xiang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09567v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09567v1)

**Summary:**

We employ the SU(n)_k Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way.

## 8. One-variable Metrics in String Theory

**Authors:** M. Fakhredin, W. A. Sabra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09537v1)

**Summary:**

Exact solutions depending on one variable of gravitational theory with antisymmetric tensor and a coupled dilaton field are obtained in arbitrary space-time dimensions. These solutions are relevant to M-theory, type IIA and type IIB supergravity theories in various space- time signatures. The solutions are also relevant to the theory of supergravity in the form of a supergravity boson. They can be found in the book "Gravitational Theory: Theories of Supergravity" by Richard Feynman, published by Springer.

## 9. From Weyl Anomaly to Defect Supersymmetric RÃ©nyi Entropy and Casimir   Energy

**Authors:** Zi-Xiao Huang, Ma-Ke Yuan, Yang Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09498v1)

**Summary:**

We present a closed-form expression for the contribution of surface defects to the supersymmetric R\'enyi entropy in six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theories. Our results show that this defect contribution is a linear function of $1/n$ and is directly proportional to $2b-d_2$, where $b$ and $ d_2$ are the surface defect Weyl anomaly coefficients. We also derive aclosed-form equation for the defect contribution to the Casimir energy, which simplifies to $-d-2$ in the chiral algebra limit.

## 10. Geometry and symmetries of Hermitian-Einstein and instanton connection   moduli spaces

**Authors:** Georgios Papadopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09474v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the geometry of the moduli spaces of Hermitian-Einstein irreducible connections on a vector bundle $E$ over a K\"ahler with torsion (KT) manifold. We demonstrate that such vector fields induce an action on $E' that leaves both the metric and complex structure invariant. In addition motivated by applications to AdS/CFT, we explore the (superconformal) symmetry algebras of two-dimensional sigma models with target spaces.

## 11. Two-loop four-point amplitudes on the Coulomb branch of   ${\mathcal{N}}=4$ super Yang-Mills

**Authors:** Wojciech Flieger, Johannes Henn, Anders Schreiber, Jaroslav Trnka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09454v1)

**Summary:**

We explore scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. This is motivated by an extension of the Amplituhedron that leads to infrared-finite four-particle amplitudes involving massive particles. We present details of the computation of the required two-loop four-point integrals via a four-dimensional version of the differential equations method. We find that when organized in terms of a suitable expansion parameter, the subleading power term exponentiates, with the exponent matching the dimension of a cusped Wilson line.

## 12. Observable Signatures of RN Black Holes with Dark Matter Halos via   Strong Gravitational Lensing and Constraints from EHT Observations

**Authors:** Niyaz Uddin Molla, Himanshu Chaudhary, Salvatore Capozziello, Farruh Atamurotov, G. Mustafa, Ujjal Debnath

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09439v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09439v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the impact of dark matter halos on the gravitational lensing produced by electrically charged, spherically symmetric black holes in the strong-field regime. The study focuses on two dark matter models: the Universal Rotation Curve Model and the cold dark matter model. We find that the strong deflection angle, $\alpha_D$ , increases with the charge parameter $Q$ in the presence of a dark matter halo. Our findings suggest that charged black holes with dark Matter halos can be differentiated from standard black holes.

## 13. Double-Scaled SYK, QCD, and the Flat Space Limit of de Sitter Space

**Authors:** Yasuhiro Sekino, Leonard Susskind

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09423v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09423v1)

**Summary:**

A surprising connection exists between double-scaled SYK at infinite temperature, and large N QCD. The 't Hooft limit of QCD parallels the fixed p limit of SYK (for a theory with p-fermion interactions) The limit of fixed gauge coupling g -- the flat space limit in AdS/CFT -- parallels the double- scaled limit ofSYK. The correspondence is largely independent of the conjectured duality between DSSYK and de Sitter space, but may have a good deal to tell us about it.

## 14. Maxwell-$f(Q)$ theory

**Authors:** G. G. L. Nashed

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09373v1)

**Summary:**

The four-dimensional AdS black hole is crucial within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We analyze the singularities of such a solution, computing all the quantities of different curvature and non-metricity invariants. We examine several physical characteristics of black holes from a thermodynamics perspective and demonstrate the existence of an outer event horizon in addition to the inner Cauchy horizons. Finally, we derive a class of rotating black hole in $f(Q)$ gravity that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter charged.

## 15. Comments on Minitwistors and the Celestial Supersphere

**Authors:** Igor Mol

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09371v1)

**Summary:**

We extend the Roiban-Spradlin-Volovich-Witten (RSVW) formalism to celestial amplitudes. We reformulate the tree-level maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) celestial leaf amplitudes for gluons in supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory and for gravitons in Supergravity in terms of minitwistor wavefunctions. We demonstrate that the semiclassical effective action of these models reproduces the MHV gluonic and gravitational leaf Amplitudes in SYM theory and Supergravity.

## 16. Reassessing aspects of the photon's LQG-modified dispersion relations

**Authors:** P. A. L. MourÃ£o, G. L. L. W. Levy, J. A. HelayÃ«l-Neto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09370v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09370v1)

**Summary:**

The study is based on a scenario based on the effects of the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) on the electromagnetic sector of the Standard Model of Fundamental Interactions and Particle Physics. Among these, we contemplate the combined effect between the LQG parameters and a homogeneous background magnetic field on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, considering in detail issues like group velocities and refractive indices of the QED vacuum. We conclude that there emerges an interesting nonlinear profile in the wavelengths of both the incoming and the deflected photons.

## 17. Super-entropy bumblebee AdS black holes

**Authors:** B. Eslam Panah

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09317v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermodynamic instability for the bumblebee AdS black holes. We evaluate the effect of the bumblesbee field (or Lorentz-violating parameter) on the event horizon. In non-extended phase space, we investigate the heat capacity and the Helmholtz free energy to investigate the local and global thermal stability areas. We extend our study on the extended phase space by seeking on stable area by using the Heat capacity at constant pressure ($C_{P}$). Finally, we evaluate the super-entropy black hole condition.

## 18. Acceleration temperature for quantum fields without event horizon

**Authors:** F. Sobrero, M. S. Soares, T. Guerreiro, N. F. Svaiter

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09264v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate unitarily inequivalent representations of the algebra of operators in quantum field theory. In those cases that exist a Fock representation of the commutation relations, we have a unique no-quanta state. We examine more closely the operational definition of a measuring device which detect a quantum of an Hermitian scalar field. The Unruh-DeWitt and Glauber model of quanta detectors are discussed. The transition probability per unit proper time of both detectors is studied in two different non-inertial frames of reference.
