## 0. On symmetry-resolved generalized entropies

**Authors:** Fei Yan, Sara Murciano, Pasquale Calabrese, Robert Konik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14165v1)

**Summary:**

Symmetry-resolved entanglement has attracted a lot of attention recently. We aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of the structure of quantum entanglements in systems with global symmetries. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.

## 1. Towards the HEFT-hedron: the complete set of positivity constraints at   NLO

**Authors:** Debsubhra Chakraborty, Susobhan Chattopadhyay, Rick S. Gupta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14155v1)

**Summary:**

We present the complete set of positivity bounds on the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at next-to-leading order (NLO) We identify the 15 operators that can be constrained by positivity, as they contribute to $s^2$-growth in the amplitude for longitudinal gauge-Higgs scattering. For the $V_L V_L, hh \to hh$ process, there are no reported experimental limits. We find that only about $5\%$ of the parameter space for WCs of HEFT operators at NLO complies with these positivity constraints.

## 2. Alleviating cosmological tensions with a hybrid dark sector

**Authors:** Elsa M. Teixeira, Gaspard Poulot, Carsten van de Bruck, Eleonora Di Valentino, Vivian Poulin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14139v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate a cosmological model inspired by hybrid inflation. Two scalar fields representing dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interact through a coupling. Using CMB data, DESI BAO measurements and Pantheon+ supernova observations, we find that the model allows for an increase in $H_0$ that can help reduce the Hubble tension. We find that higher values of the coupling parameter are correlated with lower values of $\omega_m$ and a mild decrease of the weak-lensing parameter $S_8.

## 3. Gravitational lensing in a plasma from worldlines

**Authors:** Francesco Comberiati, Leonardo de la Cruz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14126v1)

**Summary:**

We study the deflection of light rays in a cold, non-magnetized plasma using the worldline framework. Starting from Synge's Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a position-space action and use it perturbatively to calculate light bending angles. In the homogeneous case, the action reduces to that of a massive particle, allowing us to extract the bending angle of light in the presence of the medium using a well-known analogy. We consider a power law model and construct Feynman rules in time to compute the purely plasma-induced corrections to thebending angle at Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO)

## 4. Path integral measure and RG equations for gravity

**Authors:** C. Branchina, V. Branchina, F. Contino, A. Pernace

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14108v1)

**Summary:**

We find that there is no sign of the non-trivial UV-attractive fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario. Crucial to our analysis is a careful treatment of the measure in the path integral that defines the running action and a proper introduction of the physical running scale $k$. We also show why and how in usual implementations of the RG equations the aforementioned UV- attractive fixedpoint is generated. We conclude by showing that the Einstein-Hilbert truncation of the renormalization group equations for the cosmological and Newton constant is not a problem.

## 5. Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation

**Authors:** Guillermo Ballesteros, Jesús Gambín Egea, Thomas Konstandin, Alejandro Pérez Rodríguez, Mathias Pierre, Julián Rey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106v1)

**Summary:**

We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra-slow- roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.

## 6. Applicability of semi-classical theories in the strong field plasma   regime

**Authors:** Haidar Al-Naseri, Gert Brodin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14099v1)

**Summary:**

 classical plasma dynamics models can work surprisingly well even for strong electromagnetic fields, approaching the Schwinger critical fields. However, the applicability of classical models tends to depend rather sensitively on the details of the problem. In the present paper, we study the specific case of plasma oscillations to draw a line between the classical and quantum relativistic regimes. A rough guideline for when the classical Vlasov theory can be applied is given. The paper is published in the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 7. Higher-derivative corrections in M-theory from precision numerical   bootstrap

**Authors:** Shai M. Chester, Ross Dempsey, Silviu S. Pufu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14094v1)

**Summary:**

We study higher-derivative corrections to the graviton scattering amplitude in M-theory. We use the conformal bootstrap combined with an integral constraint derived from supersymmetric localization in order to constrain semishort OPE coefficients appearing in the stress tensor correlator. We obtain islands that are significantly more precise than those in previous studies that did not use the integral constraint. Using these islands, we can estimate the powers and coefficients in a large central charge expansion. This allows us to accurately read off the N$^3$LO contribution, from the protected $D^6 R^4$ correction.

## 8. Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions

**Authors:** Simone Giombi, Elizabeth Himwich, Andrei Katsevich, Igor Klebanov, Zimo Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14086v1)

**Summary:**

The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover.

## 9. The gluino condensate of large-$N$ SUSY Yang-Mills

**Authors:** Claudio Bonanno, Pietro Butti, Margarita García Pérez, Antonio González-Arroyo, Ken-Ichi Ishikawa, Masanori Okawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14067v1)

**Summary:**

We present the first lattice determination of the SUSY Yang-Mills gluino condensate at large $N$. We exploit large-$N$ twisted volume reduction, and present two determinations based on the Banks-Casher relation and on a Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner-like formula. By expressing the lattice results in the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov scheme, we are able for the first time to compare lattice and analytical computations.

## 10. Anisotropic Photon and Dilepton Yield in a Thermalized Quark-Gluon   Plasma under Magnetic Fluctuations

**Authors:** Jorge David Castaño-Yepes, Enrique Muño

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14055v1)

**Summary:**

Stochastic fluctuations model the effects of nearly random initial conditions for the nuclei participating in non-central heavy-ion collisions, which are the sources of the background magnetic field. Our theoretical results predict significant anisotropic effects due to stochastic magnetic noise over the angular distribution for photon and dilepton production rates in a thermalized quark-gluon plasma phase. The study was published in the journal Theoretical Astrophysics and Particle Physics. For more, go to: http://www.astrophysics-and-particle-science.org/.

## 11. Marginal deformations of SU(2)$_k$ WZW model boundary states in open   string field theory

**Authors:** Matěj Kudrna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14024v1)

**Summary:**

We attempt to describe moduli space of boundary states in the SU(2)$_k$ WZW model by marginally deformed solutions in open string field theory. In contrast with other solutions for marginal deformations, we construct solutions with $g$-function different from the background (typically lower) So our approach essentially combines marginal and relevant deformations. We also compare the relation between the marginal parameter and the angle $\theta$ for different solutions and we find evidence suggesting that this relation is universal for certain classes of solutions.

## 12. Real observers solving imaginary problems

**Authors:** Juan Maldacena

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14014v1)

**Summary:**

The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity computations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. The one loop gravity correction contains a dimension depenent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$, which seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including an observer, this phase gets cancelled for the quantity that should correspond to a count ofStates. We also show that this phase factor gets cancelled after adding an observer to the gravity correction.

## 13. Linear response of tilted anisotropic two-dimensional Dirac cones

**Authors:** Ipsita Mandal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13978v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field or/and temperature gradient is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator.

## 14. Gravitational wave astronomy and the expansion history of the Universe

**Authors:** Massimo Giovannini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13968v1)

**Summary:**

The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. It is argued that during the next score year the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current paradigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole post-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum sensing. The multiparticle final state of the relics and its macroscopic quantumness is also discussed.

## 15. Classification of Narain CFTs and Ensemble Average

**Authors:** El Hassan Saidi, Rajae Sammani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13932v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a systematic classification of Narain conformal field theories based on finite dimensional Lie algebras. In this newly established framework, we construct a realisation of the Zamolodchikov metric of the moduli space in terms of Lie algebraic data. Properties regarding the ensemble averaging of these CFTs and their holographic dual are also derived. We discuss possible generalisations to NCFTs having dis-symmetric central charges and highlight further features of the partition function Z.

## 16. $\mathcal{SW}$-algebras and strings with torsion

**Authors:** Xenia de la Ossa, Mateo Galdeano, Enrico Marchetto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13904v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the connection between super $\mathcal{W}-algebras ($\mathcal {SW}$-algeses) and $\mathrm{G}-structures with torsion. We show that, at first order in the string length scale $ell_s$, the torsions deforms some of the OPE coefficients corresponding to special holonomy. We compare the full quantum algebra with their classical limits, obtained by studying the commutators of superconformal and $mathcal W-symmetry transformations.

## 17. Numerical evaluation of two-loop QCD helicity amplitudes for $gg\to t   \bar{t} g$ at leading colour

**Authors:** Simon Badger, Matteo Becchetti, Colomba Brancaccio, Heribertus Bayu Hartanto, Simone Zoia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13876v1)

**Summary:**

We present the first benchmark evaluation of the two-loop finite remainders for the production of a top-quark pair in association with a jet at hadron colliders in the gluon channel. We develop a new method for expressing the master integrals in terms of a (over-complete) basis of special functions that enables the infrared and ultraviolet poles to be cancelled analytically despite the presence of elliptic Feynman integrals. The helicity amplitudes are constructed using four dimensional projectors combined with finite-field techniques.

## 18. $e^+ e^- \to μ^+ μ^-$ in the Asymptotically Safe Standard Model

**Authors:** Álvaro Pastor-Gutiérrez, Jan M. Pawlowski, Manuel Reichert, Giacomo Ruisi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13800v1)

**Summary:**

Study the electron-positron to muon--anti-muon cross-section in the asymptotically safe Standard Model. Findings provide non-trivial evidence for the unitarity of the Standard Model, says the study. The study was published in the journal Theoretical Astrophysics and Particle Physics (ASAP) (http://www.asap.org/news/2013/01/27/asap- Astrophysiology-and-Particle-Physics-2013-01-27/").

## 19. Black holes and their shadows in $F(R)$ gravity

**Authors:** Shin'ichi Nojiri, S. D. Odintsov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13775v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the radii of the photon sphere and the black hole shadow in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity. For this purpose, we derive the field equation for the corresponding theory when the general spherically symmetric and static configuration is considered. This equation is the third-order differential equation with respect to $F_R(r)$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. Solving the equation, we find $F('R')$ as a function of $r$, $F 'R' is the scalar curvature.

## 20. Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled   approximations

**Authors:** Xinliang Lyu, Naoki Kawashima

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13758v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13758v1)

**Summary:**

We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional renormalization group (RG) method. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems. We propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry imposed.

## 21. An update on the determination of the sphaleron rate in finite   temperature QCD

**Authors:** Nicolò Bellini, Claudio Bonanno, Francesco D'Angelo, Massimo D'Elia, Andrea Giorgieri, Lorenzo Maio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13685v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13685v1)

**Summary:**

The sphaleron rate is a key phenomenological quantity both for the axion thermal production in the Early Universe and the Chiral Magnetic Effect occurring in the Quark-Gluon Plasma in presence of a background magnetic field. In this talk we present an extension of our recent determination of the sphalers rate, in the SU(3) gauge theory, based on the determination of a two-point function of the topological charge density at finite temperature. We also present a new theory of the Sphalerons.

## 22. The Baryon-Baryon Interaction in the Large-$N_c$ Limit

**Authors:** Thomas Vonk, Ulf-G. Meißner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13677v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the large-$N_c$ structure of the baryon-baryon potential derived in the framework of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order. We show that the leading order results can successfully be applied to the hyperon-nucleon potential. We assess the impact of SU('s' symmetry breaking' from a large-$C$ perspective and show that it can be successfully applied to hyperon nucleons.

## 23. Black Hole Shadow and other Observables away from the Horizon: Extending   the Effective Metric Descriptions

**Authors:** Manuel Del Piano, Stefan Hohenegger, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13673v1)

**Summary:**

In previous work we have developed a model-independent, effective description of quantum deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The deformations of the metric are captured by two functions of the physical distance to the horizon, which are provided in the form of self-consistent Taylor series expansions. We provide explicit approximations of physical observables that depend on finitely many effective parameters of the deformed black hole geometry, depending on the order of the Pad\'e approximant. We illustrate our results for a number of quantum black holes previously proposed in the literature.

## 24. Non-locality in Quadrupolar Gravitational Radiation

**Authors:** Salvatore Capozziello, Maurizio Capriolo, Amodio Carleo, Gaetano Lambiase

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13629v1)

**Summary:**

General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been overcome. It predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a perturbative renormalizable theory. In this paper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by exploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system. We find that the General Relativity quadrupole formula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible signature ofnon-locality.

## 25. Luminal Scalar-Tensor theories for a not so dark Dark Energy

**Authors:** S. Mironov, A. Shtennikova, M. Valencia-Villegas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13460v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational Waves (GWs) in Scalar-Tensor modifications of Einstein's gravity is different from the speed of Light. We show that, remarkably, up to 5 self-consistent couplings of the scalar of Dark Energy (DE) to the Photon are enough to make their GWs luminal in a wide set of cases. There is at least a Luminal BH theory for which the GW decay into DE is suppressed in any cosmological background.

## 26. (Anti-)Stokes Scattering on the Domain Wall String

**Authors:** Hengyuan Guo, Hui Liu, Jarah Evslin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13409v1)

**Summary:**

In a general (2+1)-dimensional scalar model, we consider the scattering of a single quantum of radiation off a domain wall string, which excites or de-excites the wall's internal shape mode. We calculate the probability densities for these processes to first order in quantum field theory, as a function of incoming momenta and angles. We include both the case in which the incident particle is transmitted and also that in which it bounces backward. Our results are given as finite-dimensional integrals of normal modes and elementary functions.

## 27. Finite-temperature phase diagram of the BMN matrix model on the lattice

**Authors:** Anosh Joseph, David Schaich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13407v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the thermal phase structure of the Berenstein--Maldacena--Nastase (BMN) matrix model using non-perturbative lattice Monte Carlo calculations. We find results for the deconfinement temperature that interpolate between the perturbative prediction at weak coupling and the large-$N$ dual supergravity calculation at strong coupling. While we confirm that the phase transition is first order for strong coupling, it appears to be continuous for weaker couplings. We conclude that the BBMN model is not a perfect model.

## 28. Strings from Feynman Diagrams

**Authors:** Rajesh Gopakumar, Rishabh Kaushik, Shota Komatsu, Edward A. Mazenc, Debmalya Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13397v1)

**Summary:**

The Feynman diagrams correspond to discrete lattice points on string moduli space, rather than discretized worldsheets. This picture is valid to all orders in the $1/N$ expansion. The embedding of these Kontsevich-like duals into the 1/2 SUSY sector of AdS/CFT is achieved by open strings on giant graviton branes. The concrete mechanism for how strings emerge from the matrix model predicts that multiple open string descriptions can exist for the same dual closed string theory.
