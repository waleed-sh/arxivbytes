## 0. Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion   categories

**Authors:** Luisa Eck

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722v1)

**Summary:**

Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We show that distinct module tensor categories over the same braided fusion category give rise to dual lattice models. Unlike regular fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} can exhibit both 1-forms and 0-forms, including non-invertible ones. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model.

## 1. Super-Hamiltonians for super-Macdonald polynomials

**Authors:** Dmitry Galakhov, Alexei Morozov, Nikita Tselousov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14714v1)

**Summary:**

The Macdonald finite-difference Hamiltonian is lifted to a super-generalization. Peculiarities of the construction in comparison to the canonical bosonic case are discussed. Eigenfunctions for this Hamiltonian are a suitable generalization of Macdonald polynomials to super-Macdonald poynomials discussed earlier in the literature. The Hamiltonian can be represented as a differential operator acting on a space of functions of both types of variables $p_k$ and $theta_k.

## 2. On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities

**Authors:** Koushiki, Pankaj S. Joshi, Sudip Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14695v1)

**Summary:**

Density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. These fluctuations would have given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high density matter blobs that developed due to fluctuations. We study such a collapse in the inflationary epoch which has been assumed earlier to form primordialblack holes. Examining the dynamics of such a collapsed universe, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form. This treatment is within the classical limits, dictated by Planck's constraints.

## 3. Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar   bosons: Scattering and bound states

**Authors:** Luis B. Castro, Antonio S. de Castro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorenz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies. We conclude that the presence of a specific LorentZ symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states.

## 4. Generalized $T\bar{T}$-like flows for scalar theories in two dimensions

**Authors:** H. Babaei-Aghbolagh, Song He, Hao Ouyang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14583v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate that the necessary condition for $SO(N) \times SO( N)$ duality invariance manifests as a partial differential equation in two-dimensional scalar theories. We derive a general perturbation solution that includes both a root and an irrelevant flow equation. We identify a general form for these flow equations that commute with each other. We conclude that the condition for the integrability of a scalar theory is the same as that for a two- dimensional theory.

## 5. Vacuum configuration of winding superstrings from non-standard   semiclassical quantization

**Authors:** Tommaso Canneti, Federico Castellani, Wolfgang Mück

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14532v1)

**Summary:**

Semiclassical quantization techniques are unreliable, if the magnitude of the quantum fluctuations becomes comparable with a classical background scale. This is the case, for example, for superstrings at temperatures close to the Hagedorn temperature. Here, we propose a non-standard treatment which aims to extend the semiclassical approach for type-II superstrings to such cases. This allows us to provide a well-posed reformulation of recent computations of the Hagingorn temperature in a large class of confining gauge theories.

## 6. HEFT Numerators from Kinematic Algebra

**Authors:** Chih-Hao Fu, Pierre Vanhove, Yihong Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14523v1)

**Summary:**

Kinematic numerators for heavy-mass effective field theory are derived from a field theory limit of the string theory vertex operator kinematic algebra introduced in arXiv:1806.09584. The numerators are correlators of nested commutators of gluon vertex operators evaluated between massive tachyonic vertex operators. The computation of the nested Commutators leads to a natural organisation in the form of rooted trees, endowed with an order that facilitates the enumeration of the various contributions. This algebra gives a string theory understanding of the field theory fusion rules.

## 7. Dynamical features and shadows of quantum Schwarzschild black hole in   effective field theories of gravity

**Authors:** Zi-Liang Wang, Emmanuele Battista

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14516v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14516v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the properties of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry involving leading one-loop long-distance quantum effects. Our analysis reveals that geodesic trajectories of both massive and massless particles can assume completely different behaviors depending on the sign assumed by the quantum contributions. The positions of stable and unstable circular orbits are determined by an algebraic quartic equation, which we solve by developing a straightforward and analytic method. We examine black hole shadows and rings by means of two different emission profile models. The Hawking temperature and the entropy of the black hole are also derived.

## 8. Dirac equation in a gauge-field background in the Moyal plane

**Authors:** Aslam Halder, Sunandan Gangopadhyay, Anirban Saha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14508v1)

**Summary:**

The dynamics of the system is dictated by the standard form of Lorentz force law. The Hall effect is studied using the NC corrected fields in the non-relativistic (NR) limit. This shows that noncommutativity affects the cyclotron frequency, but leaves the Hall conductivity unaffected at least to first order in the NC parameter. The hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen atom spectrum also shows a first order correction which helps establish an upper bound on the spatial NC parameters.

## 9. Memory and supertranslations on plane wave spacetimes: an on-shell   perspective

**Authors:** Andrea Cristofoli, Sonja Klisch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14480v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter, we revisit the computation of the classical gravitational waveform for a particle moving in a plane wave background using on-shell amplitudes. We emphasize the relationship between gravitational memory and the boundary conditions of external scattering states, which were neglected in previous works. We then provide the first tree-level expression for the waveform that captures all memory effects. The waveform is presented in terms of Synge's world function, with explicit tail terms, and a smooth weak memory limit.

## 10. Two-Loop Master Integrals for Mixed QCD-EW Corrections to $gg \to H$   Through $\mathcal{O}(ε^2)$

**Authors:** Robin Marzucca, Andrew J. McLeod, Christoph Nega

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14435v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14435v1)

**Summary:**

We consider mixed strong-electroweak corrections to Higgs production via gluon fusion. The Higgs boson couples to the top quark. We compute all of the master integrals that contribute to this process at two loops. We present the results for these master Integrals in terms of iterated integrals whose kernels depend on elliptic curves. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from..

## 11. Non-Invertible $SO(2)$ Symmetry of 4d Maxwell from Continuous Gaugings

**Authors:** Elise Paznokas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14419v1)

**Summary:**

We describe the self-duality symmetries for 4d Maxwell theory at any value of the coupling $tau$ We demonstrate that the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality of Maxwell can be realized by trivial gauging operations. We reproduce the symTFT for Maxwell and find within this framework condensation defects that implement the non-invertible $SO(2)$ self- duality symmetry. These defects are systematically constructed by higher gauging subsets of the bulk with appropriate discrete torsion.

## 12. Bipartite Current Fluctuations in Quantum Wires through Charge   Fractionalization

**Authors:** Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum information measures of many-body systems often imply a measure with multi- or two regions. Here, we introduce a new method from the bipartite current fluctuations and the divergence theorem. They reveal the fractional charges related to ground-state energetics and the proximity to Mott physics in the same ballistic quantum wires. This also encodes the behavior of the electron Green's function in space. With metallic gates on both sides of an interface to implement the protocol introducing the two macroscopic domains.

## 13. Probabilistic interpretation of quantum field theories

**Authors:** Martin Hairer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14361v1)

**Summary:**

In this note we provide a gentle introduction to the concepts and intuition behind the recent breakthrough results on the mathematically rigorous construction of a non-trivial 2D conformal field theory. This gives us the opportunity to review Segal's axioms for conformal fields theories and to discuss in some detail how the free field fits into them. We conclude with a discussion of the Liouville theory and how it relates to conformal and free field theories. We hope that this will help you understand some of the new developments in conformal theory.

## 14. On Measures in Ion Trap Quantum Information

**Authors:** Reza Pirmoradian, M Reza Tanhayi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14359v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate quantum information measures in ion traps by utilizing the harmonic oscillator model to characterize trapped potentials and ion dynamics. We also discuss the coherent state of a single ion in a trap, noting an inverse relationship between complexity and fidelity. At higher system frequencies, complexity increases due to intricate interactions and rapid state changes, necessitating advanced control mechanisms, we say. We conclude that increased fidelity corresponds to decreased system complexity, indicating a more ordered state with improved control and optimization.

## 15. The two-vertex model of loop quantum gravity: anisotropic reduced   sectors

**Authors:** Iñaki Garay, Luis J. Garay, Diego H. Gugliotta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14352v1)

**Summary:**

The so-called two-vertex model of loop quantum gravity has been analytically studied in the past within a U($N$) symmetry-reduced sector leading to a cosmological interpretation. We identify eight geometric parameters describing the polyhedral configurations and four twist angles characterizing the system's dynamics. The privileged-direction sector, the bi-twist sector, and the inhomogeneous bi-Twist sector introduce degrees of anisotropy or inhomogeneity.

## 16. Stochastic quantization with discrete fictitious time

**Authors:** Daisuke Kadoh, Mitsuhiro Kato, Makoto Sakamoto, Hiroto So

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14260v1)

**Summary:**

We present a new approach to stochastic quantization with a discrete fictitious time. The noise average is modified by weights, which results in the equivalence in the large time limit to the correlation function of the corresponding quantum field theory. We test our method in a zero-dimensional toy model both perturbatively and numerically. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, San Diego, on November 14, 2013.

## 17. Smoothness of Classical Limit in KMOC Formalism

**Authors:** Pritish Sinha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14154v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that the classical limit of three classes of inclusive observables, namely scattering angle, radiative field and angular impulse is smooth and does not suffer from any so-called superclassical divergences at all orders in perturbation. Our analysis goes some way in showing that KMOC formalism can be used to compute classical radiation by simply focussing on all the terms that scale as $hbar^0$ We conclude that the KMOC system can be applied to the theory of classical radiation.
