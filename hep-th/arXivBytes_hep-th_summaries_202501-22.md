**Authors:** Si Li, Zichang Wang, Peng Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12360v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12360v1)

**Summary:**

This paper is a case study of probabilistic approach to topological quantum field theory. We propose that the topological correlations are realized in the large variance limit. An investigation on the relation between Probabilistic topological correlation on the circle and Hochschild homology is illustrated.

## 1. Lattice defect networks in 2d Yang-Mills

**Authors:** Luca Griguolo, Elisa Iris Marieni, Itamar Yaakov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12351v1)

**Summary:**

We construct defect networks in pure Yang-Mills theory in two dimensions using a refinement of the lattice approach. The refinement preserves the locality properties of individual defects, and is compatible with solvability of the theory via subdivision invariance. We explicitly demonstrate closure of the building blocks under fusion, and we show that the theory is solvable in this way. We also show the theory can be used to construct networks in three-dimensional space and three-diminutive space.

## 2. Boundary Curvature Scalars on Conformally Compact Manifolds

**Authors:** A. Rod Gover, Jarosław Kopiński, Andrew Waldron

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12346v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a sequence of conformally invariant scalar curvature quantities, defined along the conformal infinity of a conformally compact (CC) manifold. Residues of their poles yield obstructions to smooth solutions to the singular Yamabe problem. We give explicit formulae for the first five CC boundary curvature scalars required for the global study of four dimensional Yamabe metrics, as well as asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. In a given dimension, the critical CC boundary scalar characterizes the image of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.

## 3. Electroweak Scalar Effects Beyond Dimension-6 in SMEFT

**Authors:** Nilabhra Adhikary, Tisa Biswas, Joydeep Chakrabortty, Christoph Englert, Michael Spannowsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12160v1)

**Summary:**

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a robust framework for probing deviations in the couplings of Standard Model particles. This framework relies on an expansion in higher-dimensional operators, often truncated at dimension-six. In this work, we compute the effective dimension-eight operators generated by integrating out heavy scalar fields at one-loop order in the Green's basis within two extended scalar sector models: the Two Higgs Doublet Model and the Complex Triplet Scalar Model.

## 4. Efficient PINNs: Multi-Head Unimodular Regularization of the Solutions   Space

**Authors:** Pedro Tarancón-Álvarez, Pablo Tejerina-Pérez, Raul Jimenez, Pavlos Protopapas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12116v1)

**Summary:**

The framework is based on what is called multihead (MH) training. It involves training the network to learn a general space of all solutions for a given set of equations with certain variability. This setup is used with a second novel technique that we call Unimodular Regularization (UR) of the latent space of solutions. We show that the multihead approach, combined with the regularization, significantly improves the efficiency of PINNs by facilitating the transfer learning process thereby enabling the finding of solutions for nonlinear, coupled, and multiscale differential equations.

## 5. Quantum trajectories and Page-curve entanglement dynamics

**Authors:** Katha Ganguly, Preethi Gopalakrishnan, Atharva Naik, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Manas Kulkarni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12110v1)

**Summary:**

We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum. We observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems. We also compute the number of fermion leaking to the reservoir and its associated current.

## 6. Classical dynamics of particles with non-abelian gauge charges

**Authors:** Jan W. van Holten

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12021v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12021v1)

**Summary:**

The classical dynamics of particles with (non-)abelian charges and spin moving on curved manifolds is established in the Poisson-Hamilton framework. Equations of motion are derived for the minimal quadratic Hamiltonian and some extensions involving spin-dependent interactions. It is shown that these equations of motion coincide with the consistency conditions for current and energy-momentum conservation. The classical equations cannot be derived from an action principle without extending the model. One way to overcome this problem is the introduction of anticommuting Grassmann co-ordinates.

## 7. String theory methods for defect CFTs

**Authors:** Georgios Linardopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11985v1)

**Summary:**

We examine whether the string theory duals of defect CFTs are classically integrable. This amounts to identifying all string boundary conditions on probe branes which preserve the integrability of the underlying Green-Schwarz sigma model. We compute holographic defect correlation functions with semiclassical strings. We outline the computation of two and higher-point correlation functions in strongly coupled defect C FTs. We discuss string theory methods for the study of defect conformal field theories.

## 8. Modified gravitational wave propagations in linearized gravity with   Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations and their gravitational wave   constraints

**Authors:** Qiang Wang, Jian-Ming Yan, Tao Zhu, Wen Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11956v1)

**Summary:**

Standard model extension (SME) is an effective field theory framework that can be used to study the possible violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance in the gravitational interaction. It is shown that the violations modify the conventional linear dispersion relation of gravitational waves, leading to anisotropy, birefringence, and dispersion effects. With these modified dispersion relations, we then calculate the dephasing effects in the waveforms of gravitational wave produced by the coalescence of compact binaries in the LIGO catalogs GWTC-3.

## 9. Trace-free Einstein gravity as two interacting constrained $BF$ theories

**Authors:** Merced Montesinos, Diego Gonzalez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948v1)

**Summary:**

A theory of gravity alternative to general relativity is trace-free Einstein gravity. It has the remarkable property that the cosmological constant emerges as an integration constant. The new actions have the advantage of not involving any nondynamical fields or unimodular condition, and their only gravitational sector istrace-freeinstein gravity. They describe the theory as two $BF$ theories supplemented with some constraints. The first action comprises two copies of the constrained $ BF$ theory for the Husain-Kucha model. The second action employs two copies. of the chiral Plebanski action for general relativity plus an additional constraint.

## 10. Trace-free Einstein gravity as a constrained bigravity theory

**Authors:** Merced Montesinos, Diego Gonzalez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11939v1)

**Summary:**

Trace-free Einstein gravity is a prominent alternative to general relativity. In the first version, the cosmological constant arises as an integration constant. We report two diffeomorphism-invariant actions in which the energy-momentum conservation emerges directly from the equations of motion. To achieve this, auxiliary fields but otherwise dynamical are introduced in the corresponding actions, which have the form a constrained bigravity theory. These results constitute a significant advance in our understanding of trace- free Einstein gravity.

## 11. Black holes in thermal bath live shorter: implications for primordial   black holes

**Authors:** Jitumani Kalita, Debaprasad Maity, Ayan Chatterjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11925v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11925v1)

**Summary:**

 Hawking radiation from a non-extremal black hole is known to be approximately Planckian. The thermal spectrum receives multiple corrections including greybody factors and kinematical restrictions on the infrared and ultraviolet frequencies. We show that another significant correction to the spectrum arises if the black Hole is assumed to live in a thermal bath and the emitted radiation gets thermalised at the bath temperature. This modification reshapes the thermal spectrum, and leads to appreciable deviation from standard results. We argue that this altered decay rate has significance for cosmology.

## 12. Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum

**Authors:** Wei-Yang Liu, Ismail Zahed

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856v1)

**Summary:**

In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations. It is also used to estimate the proton and neutron electric Dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The result is based on a lattice simulation of QCD.

## 13. Charged rotating black holes in scalar multipolar universes

**Authors:** Cristian Stelea, Marina-Aura Dariescu, Vitalie Lungu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11807v1)

**Summary:**

Cardoso and Nat\'ario [6] constructed an exact solution of Einstein-scalar field equations that describes a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe. This solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7]. In this work we show how to further generalize these solutions in presence of rotation and various charges. More specifically, we describe the general charged rotating black holes with NUT charge and present some of their properties..
