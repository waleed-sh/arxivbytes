## 0. Generalized Symmetries of Non-SUSY and Discrete Torsion String   Backgrounds

**Authors:** Noah Braeger, Vivek Chakrabhavi, Jonathan J. Heckman, Max Hübner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10484v1)

**Summary:**

String / M-theory backgrounds with degrees of freedom at a localized singularity provide a general template for generating strongly correlated systems decoupled from lower-dimensional gravity. There are by now several complementary procedures for extracting the associated generalized symmetry data from orbifolds of the form $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$, including methods based on the boundary topology of the asymptotic geometry. We show that this match between the two methods also works in non-supersymmetric and discrete torsion backgrounds.

## 1. Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields

**Authors:** Arko Bhaumik, Theodoros Papanikolaou, Anish Ghoshal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbation. We show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first- order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGw signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales.

## 2. False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer   and time-averaged observables

**Authors:** Fumiya Sano, Junsei Tokuda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472v1)

**Summary:**

We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherent rate at one loop. We argue that these diverGences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer.

## 3. Holographic Entanglement Entropy in the FLRW Universe

**Authors:** Toshifumi Noumi, Fumiya Sano, Yu-ki Suzuki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10457v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10457v1)

**Summary:**

We compute a holographic entanglement entropy via Ryu--Takayanagi prescription in the three-dimensional Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe. We find in general that the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in addition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. These conditions provide a necessary condition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with the strongSubadditivity. We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the static patch holography and the half de Sitter holographic.

## 4. Out of the box approach to Black hole Information paradox

**Authors:** Kiran Adhikari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10429v1)

**Summary:**

The black hole information loss paradox arises from semiclassical arguments. Resolution to the paradox typically demands violation of quantum mechanics or relativity in domains where they should hold. I propose that in a complete theory of quantum gravity, any region that could collapse into a black hole should already be described by a mixed state. To that end, I present a model in which the universe is in a quantum error-corrected state, such that any local black hole appears mixed and encodes no information locally.

## 5. Can spacetime torsion source an extremely red-tilted cosmological GW   background?

**Authors:** Arko Bhaumik, Bhaswati Mandal, Soumitra SenGupta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10402v1)

**Summary:**

In the presence of spacetime torsion, any generic $f(R)$ model of gravity is conformally dual to a scalar-tensor theory augmented with a second rank antisymmetric massless degree of freedom. We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) that may be sourced directly at the second order by such a torsional field. The resulting second-order induced SGWB, which dominates over the primary inflationary GW background at all scales, peaks only at ultra-low frequencies.

## 6. Universal fault-tolerant logic with heterogeneous holographic codes

**Authors:** Matthew Steinberg, Junyu Fan, Jens Eisert, Sebastian Feld, Alexander Jahn, Chunjun Cao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10386v1)

**Summary:**

The study of holographic bulk-boundary dualities has led to the construction of novel quantum error correcting codes. These codes have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. Unlike standard concatenated codes, the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block.

## 7. Root-$T\bar{T}$ Deformations On Causal Self-Dual Electrodynamics   Theories

**Authors:** Hossein Babaei-Aghbolagh, Komeil Babaei Velni, Song He, Zahra Pezhman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10361v1)

**Summary:**

The self-dual condition, which ensures invariance under electromagnetic duality, manifests as a partial differential equation in nonlinear electromagnetism theories. In this paper, we investigate theories with two coupling constants that also comply with the principle of causality. We demonstrate that these theories possess a new universal representation of the root-$T\bar{T}$ operator. We also identify a symmetry referred to as $\alpha$-symmetry, which is present in all these models.

## 8. Modular invariant gluon-graviton scattering in AdS at one loop

**Authors:** Shai M. Chester, Pietro Ferrero, Daniele R. Pavarini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10319v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10319v1)

**Summary:**

We consider mixed gluon-graviton scattering in Type IIB string theory. We compute this holographic correlator in the large $N$ and finite $tau$ expansion using constraints from derivatives of the mass deformed sphere free energy. We also compute the one-loop correction to the correlator, and match it to the expected flat space limit result. In particular, we combine this constraint with the knownflat space limit to fix the $R^2F^2$ higher derivative correction.

## 9. Extended-BMS Anomalies and Flat Space Holography

**Authors:** Laurent Baulieu, Luca Ciambelli, Tom Wetzstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10304v1)

**Summary:**

We classify the Lagrangians and anomalies of an extended BMS field theory using BRST methods. We find that supertranslations are anomaly-free, while superrotations exhibit independent central charges. The absence of supertranslation anomalies aligns with Weinberg's soft graviton theorem being tree-level exact. This work provides a first-principle derivation of the structure of the null boundary field theory. It offers further evidence for the holographic principle in flat space, and its dimensional reduction.

## 10. Gravity-induced emergence of the Fermi scale in quantum quadratic   gravity

**Authors:** Mohammad Mehrafarin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10293v1)

**Summary:**

In the framework of asymptotic safety, we study quantum quadratic gravity in the presence of the Higgs field considered as non-separable from the vacuum. At this fixed point the symmetry breaks and the Fermi scale emerges. Gravity at the UV scale is purely quadRatic whereas at the Fermani scale it is linear. In the intermediate region both contributions are relevant, giving rise to Einstein gravity and the electroweak phase transition. The latter renders the ghost graviton an unstable high mass resonance which renders unitarity.

## 11. Towards a Flat Space Carrollian Hologram from AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$

**Authors:** Arthur Lipstein, Romain Ruzziconi, Akshay Yelleshpur Srikant

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10291v1)

**Summary:**

Finding a concrete example holography in four dimensional asymptotically flat space is an important open problem. In this limit, the boundary of AdS$_4$ becomes null infinity and the ABJM theory should exhibit an emergent superconformal Carrollian symmetry. We investigate this possiblity by matching the Carrollian limit of ABJM correlators with four-dimensional supergravity amplitudes that arise from taking the flat space limit and reducing along the S$^7$.

## 12. Quantized Axial Charge in the Hamiltonian Approach to Wilson Fermions

**Authors:** Tatsuya Yamaoka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10263v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of 1+1~D staggered fermions. We reconstruct vector and axial charge operators, found by Arkya Chatterjee et al., using the Wilson fermion formalism. Our formulation supports symmetry-preserving interactions with quantized chiral charges. As applications, we examine the implementation of the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) mechanism in the $1^4(-1)^4$ and 3-4-5-0 models.

## 13. A parton shower consistent with parton densities at LO and NLO: PDF2ISR

**Authors:** H. Jung, L. Lönnblad, M. Mendizabal, S. Taheri Monfared

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10243v1)

**Summary:**

We present a method for obtaining an initial-state parton shower model where the (backward) evolution fully consistent with the (forward) evolution of the collinear parton density used. As a proof-of-concept we use parton densities obtained with the Parton Branching (PB) approach, and modify the default initial- state shower in PYTHIA8 with this method to be consistent with them. The method presented here, which we have named PDF2ISR, can be easily extended to any collinoid densities, as long as the exact conditions are known.

## 14. Dual Theory of Turbulent Mixing

**Authors:** Alexander Migdal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205v1)

**Summary:**

We present an exact analytic solution for incompressible turbulent mixing described by 3D NS equations. The statistical limit, corresponding to decaying turbulence, can be computed in quadrature. We find the decay spectrum and the scaling functions of the pair correlation and match them with physical and real experiments. We represent the correlation functions of a passive scalar as statistical averages over the Euler ensemble. The results are based on a recent solution of decaying turbulence in terms of theEuler ensemble, which we present here.

## 15. Black Hole Singularities from Holographic Complexity

**Authors:** Vyshnav Mohan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10194v1)

**Summary:**

Using a second law of complexity, we prove a black hole singularity theorem. We show that their existence implies null geodesic incompleteness inside globally hyperbolic black holes. We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume of extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the singularity. In static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the growing rate of spacelike extremal surface going to zero at the singularities.

## 16. Strong decays of singly heavy baryons

**Authors:** Xiaoning Xie, Juntao Tong, Qi Huang, Hongxia Huang, Jialun Ping

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10183v1)

**Summary:**

More and more excited baryons have been reported experimentally, but many properties are still unclear. This work attempts to simultaneously study the masses and strong decay widths of some singly heavy baryon states. We considered not only two-body strong decays but also the influence of three-body decays. The results are consistent with experimental data and the conclusions of most theoretical studies. It is hoped that our calculations can provide valuable information for the experimental and theoretical studies of heavybaryons.

## 17. Axion Mixing in the String Axiverse

**Authors:** Hai-Jun Li, Yu-Feng Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10170v1)

**Summary:**

The string axiverse presents a fascinating and complex landscape for axion physics. This study presents the first systematic exploration of axion mass mixing in scenarios involving more than two axions. The findings provide critical insights into axion dynamics not only within type IIB string ax universe models but also in broader multi-axion mixing frameworks. The potential cosmological implications of axION mass mixing are also addressed at the end. Our work contributes to the understanding ofAxion physics in string theory.

## 18. Heat Kernel methods in the first-order formalism

**Authors:** Abhishek Kumar Mehta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10115v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we extend the heat kernel methods to the first-order formalism of gravity, specifically, in the language of differential forms. This allows us to compute the effective dynamics of 4D gravity when the tetrad degrees of freedom are integrated out. We show that the resulting effective field theory is the Lorentz gauge theory. The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics on November 14. For more information, visit the journal's website.

## 19. Regularization of Functional Determinants of Radial Operators via Heat   Kernel Coefficients

**Authors:** Yutaro Shoji, Masahide Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10099v1)

**Summary:**

We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate the large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants. In the limit of a big angular momentum, our formulas reduce to the WKB formulas in previous studies, but extended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta function regularization and the dimensional regularization. We propose an efficient regularization method forfunctional determinants of radial operators using heat kernel coefficient. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernels expansion.

## 20. Analyzing reduced density matrices in SU(2) Chern-Simons theory

**Authors:** Atesh Saini, Siddharth Dwivedi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10098v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the reduced density matrices obtained for the quantum states in the context of 3d Chern-Simons theory. We show that the characteristic polynomials of these reduceddensity matrices are monic polynmials with rational coefficients. We focus on quantum states associated with the $T_{p,p}$ torus link complements, which is a $p$-party pure quantum state. The reduced densityMatrices are obtained by taking the $(1|p-1)$ bi-partition of the total system.

## 21. BSFT-like action from cohomomorphism

**Authors:** Jojiro Totsuka-Yoshinaka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10061v1)

**Summary:**

We construct an action that reproduces the characteristic structure of boundary string field theory (BSFT) We show that the form and several properties of this BSFT-like action closely resemble those of BSFT. Our results suggest that this approach provides a systematic framework to derive the BSFT action from the OSFT based on $A_\infty$ algebras. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from..

## 22. The gravitational index of a small black ring

**Authors:** Subhodip Bandyopadhyay, Gurmeet Singh Punia, Yogesh K. Srivastava, Amitabh Virmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09982v1)

**Summary:**

Small black rings in a five-dimensional string theory have zero area event horizon. The 4D-5D connection relates these small rings to small black holes without angular momentum in one less dimension. The dominant contribution comes from a black ring saddle that rotates in both independent planes in five dimensions. We also write the saddle solution as a three-center Bena-Warner solution. We propose an analogous saddle solution for a 5-dimensional small black ring. It is a four-dimensional black ring with a finite area event Horizon.

## 23. Dynamically assisted Klein tunneling in the Furry picture

**Authors:** Makoto Ochiai, Shunsuke Shibayama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09916v1)

**Summary:**

One-dimensional scattering of a wave packet of a relativistic fermion under a temporally oscillating electric field superimposed on a potential step is discussed by using the Furry-picture perturbation theory. We show that even in the absence of the so-called Klein region, a positive-frequency incoming wave can penetrate the negative-frequency region below the potential step by emitting its energy. Reflection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet in its single-mode limit are consistent with those in the stationary scattering off the potentialstep alone.

## 24. Harvesting entanglement from the cylindrical gravitational wave   spacetime

**Authors:** Feifan He, Yongjie Pan, Baocheng Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09815v1)

**Summary:**

Two spatially separated detectors can extract entanglement from the specific spacetime in the presence of gravitational waves. The enhanced detectability demonstrates the advantages of cylindrical symmetric gravitational waves, says the study. The research is based on the theory of Einstein and Rosen, who first proposed the idea in Einstein's Theory of Relativistic Quantum Gravity. The study was published in the journal of Theoretical Physics and Theory of Quantum Entanglement, which is published by the Royal Institute of Technology, London.

## 25. Quantum theory from classical mechanics near equilibrium

**Authors:** Albert Schwarz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09806v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09806v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$ have a non-degenerate minimum at the point where generalized momenta $p$ and generalized coordinates $q$ vanish. In this situation, in the neighborhood of the point $p=0, q=0$ quadratic part of a Hamiltonian plays a dominant role. We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding toquadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.

## 26. Coupling Selection Rules in Heterotic Calabi-Yau Compactifications

**Authors:** Jun Dong, Tatsuo Kobayashi, Ryusei Nishida, Satsuki Nishimura, Hajime Otsuka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09773v1)

**Summary:**

We study coupling selection rules of chiral matter fields in heterotic string theory with standard embedding. These selection rules are determined by topological properties of Calabi-Yau threefolds. It is found that all of these selection rules for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$ are understood by combinations of only five types of fusion rules. We classify coupling selectionrules on complete intersection Calabi/Yau 3folds as $h1,2,3,4,5$

## 27. The linear relations between the complex moduli and using the linear   relations reduce the stabilization equations for supersymmetric black holes   in N=2 theory

**Authors:** Dafa Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09765v1)

**Summary:**

The black hole entropy was derived by solving the matrix equation obtained from the stabilization equations for the solution of frozen moduli. In this paper, we find linear relations between any two of the three complex moduli at the black hole horizon. Via the linear relations, we derive the unique solution of Frozen moduli and reduce the stabilization equation in three different ways. For example, the eight stabilization equations in [Phys. Rev. D 54, 6293 (1996)] can be replaced equivalently with three equations: The solution of moduli z1 and two linear relations.
