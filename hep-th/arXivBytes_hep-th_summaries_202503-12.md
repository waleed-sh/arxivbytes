## 0. Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of   spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds

**Authors:** Amirhossein Samandar, Javier Carrón Duque, Craig J. Copi, Mikel Martin Barandiaran, Deyan P. Mihaylov, Glenn D. Starkman, Yashar Akrami, Stefano Anselmi, Fernando Cornet-Gomez, Johannes R. Eskilt, Andrew H. Jaffe, Arthur Kosowsky, Anna Negro, Joline Noltmann, Thiago S. Pereira, Andrius Tamosiunas

**Summary:**

We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology.

## 1. Massive fields and Wilson spools in JT gravity

**Authors:** Jackson R. Fliss

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08657v1)

**Summary:**

We give a prescription for minimally coupling massive matter to JT gravity with either sign of cosmological constant directly in its formulation as a topological BF theory. This coupling takes the form of a `Wilson spool,' originally introduced in the context of three-dimensional gravity. The Wilson spool expresses the exact one-loop partition function as the integral over a Wilson loop operator. We construct the spool by considering the partition function of a massive scalar field on Euclidean dS$_2$.

## 2. Isotropic embeddings of coadjoint orbits and magnetic geodesic flows

**Authors:** Dmitri Bykov, Andrew Kuzovchikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08646v1)

**Summary:**

We consider isotropic and Lagrangian embeddings of coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups. We prove equivalence between systems of two types: those describing magnetic geodesic flow on flag manifolds and classical `spin chains' of a special type. In the second part we apply this to the study of dynamical systems with $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ symmetry, proving equivalence in the case of the special type of spin chains. We conclude that the equivalence is true in both cases.

## 3. Fracton Gauge Theories in Curved Spacetimes

**Authors:** Evangelos Afxonidis, Alessio Caddeo, Carlos Hoyos, Daniele Musso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08621v1)

**Summary:**

Fractonic matter with dipole symmetry can be coupled to a two-index symmetric tensor gauge field. The field can be consistently coupled to curved backgrounds in a covariant and gauge-invariant way. Our results pave the way for future extensions, including generalizations to higher-order multipole theories, the authors say. The study was published in the journal Theoretical Mechanics and Theory.

## 4. Logarithmic corrections to near-extremal entropy of charged de Sitter   black holes

**Authors:** Sabyasachi Maulik, Arpita Mitra, Debangshu Mukherjee, Augniva Ray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08617v1)

**Summary:**

The extremal limit of a charged dS black hole is uniquely intriguing and remarkably different from its flat and AdS counterparts. In the near-horizon limit, there are three distinct extremal limits known as cold, Nariai, and ultracold configurations. We calculate the logarithmic temperature corrections to the thermodynamic entropy of four-dimensional near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m de Sitter (dS) black hole.

**Summary:**

We review recent progress in constructing maximal, classical supergravity models and their applications. We also discuss some of the potential applications of these models. We conclude with a discussion of the role of supergravity in today's society and society at large. We end with a look at the potential uses of super gravity in the 21st century.

## 6. Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra

**Authors:** Vassily Gorbounov, Christian Korff, Leonardo C. Mihalcea

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602v1)

**Summary:**

In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians. We construct geometrically defined operators onQuantumK-rings describing this action. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the Quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action) In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.

## 7. $\mathcal{I}$-extremization with baryonic charges

**Authors:** Seyed Morteza Hosseini, Alberto Zaffaroni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08591v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08591v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an entropy function for AdS$_4$ BPS black holes in M-theory with general magnetic charges. The entropy function is constructed from a gravitational block defined solely in terms of topological data of the internal manifold. We show that the entropy of twisted black holes can always be reformulated as an $\mathcal{I}$-extremization problem -- even in cases where existing large-$N$ field theory computations fail to provide an answer. We correctly reproduce the entropy for a class of known black holes with purely baryonic magnetic charges and offer a conjecture for the general gravitational block.

## 8. Density matrices in quantum field theory: Non-Markovianity, path   integrals and master equations

**Authors:** Christian Käding, Mario Pitschmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08567v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08567v1)

**Summary:**

Density matrices are powerful mathematical tools for the description of closed and open quantum systems. Recently, methods for the direct computation of density matrix elements in scalar quantum field theory were developed based on thermo field dynamics (TFD) and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this article, we provide a more detailed discussion of these methods and derive expressions fordensity matrix elements of closed or open systems. We find that, even in a general basis, the dynamical map is not divisible, which renders the dynamics of open systems non-Markovian.

## 9. Constructing noncommutative black holes

**Authors:** Tajron Jurić, A. Naveena Kumara, Filip Požar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08560v1)

**Summary:**

We present a self-contained and consistent formulation of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory of gravity. Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of Poincar\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity. We obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin connection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and curvature scalars. The methods and expansions we present can be extended to more general geometries including rotating black holes and additional matter fields.

## 10. Decoupling theorem and effective quantum gravity

**Authors:** Ilya L. Shapiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08544v1)

**Summary:**

## 11. Effect of generic dark matter halo on transonic accretion onto galactic   black holes

**Authors:** Avijit Chowdhury, Gargi Sen, Sayan Chakrabarti, Santabrata Das

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08528v1)

**Summary:**

The environment surrounding a black hole or black hole binaries is generally expected to play an important role in understanding various astrophysical phenomena around them. In this paper, we study relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic supermassive black hole dressed with a cold dark matter halo. Our results show enhancement of disk luminosity in the presence of dark matter, which depends on the nature and properties (halo mass and compactness) of the dark matter distribution.

## 12. A Proof of the Weak Gravity Conjecture via Leading-Order Quantum Gravity   Effects

**Authors:** Yong Xiao, Qiang Wang, Aonan Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08459v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08459v1)

**Summary:**

The weak gravity conjecture posits that there should exist at least one state with a charge-to-mass ratio $q/M>1$, ensuring that an extremal charged black hole can still decay. In this paper, we study the corrections to the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within an effective field theory framework. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at one-loop level. We show that these quantum gravity effects naturally lead to the super-extremality of charged black holes.

## 13. Testing the dark origin of neutrino masses with oscillation experiments

**Authors:** Andrew Cheek, Luca Visinelli, Hong-Yi Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08439v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08439v1)

**Summary:**

The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown to date. One popular idea involves interactions between neutrinos and ultralight dark matter. We demonstrate that the mechanism becomes sensitive to dark matter density fluctuations. This suppresses the oscillatory behavior of flavor-changing probabilities in a model-independent way, thereby ruling out this regime. The mass range can be further tested in current and future oscillation experiments by searching for time variations (rather than periodicity) in oscillation parameters, we say.

## 14. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics from novel relaxation time approximation

**Authors:** Samapan Bhadury

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08428v1)

**Summary:**

A new collision kernel is proposed that conserves the energy-momentum tensor and the spin tensor of a relativistic fluid of spin-1/2 particles irrespective of the frame and matching conditions. The results indicate the expected existence of Barnett-like effect and the non-existence of Einstein--de-Haas-like effects, according to the study. The study was published in the journal Physics of Relativistic Fluid. It is based on a semi-classical kinetic theory with general definitions for the frame.

## 15. Observational Viability of Anisotropic Inflation Revisited

**Authors:** Maryam Roushan, Narges Rashidi, Kourosh Nozari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08277v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate anisotropic inflation within the single-field model featuring an intermediate scale factor. Our analysis reveals that the Friedmann equations in this framework affects the slow-roll parameters, which in turn influence key perturbation parameters. We examine the reheating phase using these constraints on constraints on $c$ and $beta$ and determine the observationally consistent ranges for the number of e-folds and the temperature during the reheaking phase. The model is consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO data at $68\%$ CL.

## 16. Cosmological Implications of Modified Entropic Gravity

**Authors:** Kazem Rezazadeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08236v1)

**Summary:**

Modified entropic cosmology (MEC) model can explain the dynamics of the universe without requiring any kind of dark energy. Using the Pantheon supernovae dataset, BAO data, Planck 2018 CMB data, and SH0ES measurements for $H_0$, we test the MEC model against observations. We will see that MEC fits the observational data better than the standard cosmological model of $Lambda$CDM. We also see that our model can successfully solve the $h_0$ tension that challenges the standardcosmological models.

## 17. Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity

**Authors:** Salvatore Capozziello, Sara Cesare, Carmen Ferrara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08167v1)

**Summary:**

Extensions of equivalent representations of gravity are discussed in the metric-affine framework. The aim is to show that also if dynamics are equivalent, foundations of theories of gravity can be very different. We discuss the straightforward extension of General Relativity, the $f(R)$ gravity. The latter are the extensions of Teleparallel Equivalent of General. Relativity and Symmetric Telepar parallel of Generalrelativity, respectively. We obtain that $f('R')$ and $f'('Q') form the Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity.

## 18. Out-of-Time-Order-Correlators in Holographic EPR pairs

**Authors:** Shoichi Kawamoto, Da-Shin Lee, Chen-Pin Yeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08114v1)

**Summary:**

In this note, we investigate the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) for quantum fields in a holographic framework describing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. We compute the four-point and six-point OTOCs using the gravity dual, represented by the string worldsheet theory in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. These correlators quantify the rate at which information is scrambled, leading to the disentanglement of the EPR pair.

## 19. Non-hermitian integrable systems from constant non-invertible solutions   of the Yang-Baxter equation

**Authors:** Somnath Maity, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08109v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08109v1)

**Summary:**

We construct invertible spectral parameter dependent Yang-Baxter solutions. The solutions are algebraic (representation independent) They are constructed using supersymmetry (SUSY) algebras. The resulting $R$-matrices are regular leading to local non-hermitian Hamiltonians. With appropriate representations of the SUSY generators we obtain spin chains in all local Hilbert space dimensions. On comparing with the literature we find two of the models are new. Many of them are also non-diagonalizable with interesting spectrums.

## 20. Long-range interaction of kinks in higher-order polynomial models

**Authors:** Ekaterina Belendryasova, Petr A. Blinov, Tatiana V. Gani, Alexander A. Malnev, Vakhid A. Gani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08034v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08034v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain asymptotic estimates of the interaction forces between kink and antikink in a family of field-theoretic models with two vacua in (1+1)-dimensional space-time. We show that if the kinks are faced each other with long-range tails, the force of attraction between them at large separations demonstrates a power-law decay with the distance. We also performed numerical simulations to measure the interaction force and obtained good agreement between the experimental values and theoretical estimates.
