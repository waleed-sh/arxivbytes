## 0. Revisiting black holes of algebraic type D with a cosmological constant

**Authors:** Hryhorii Ovcharenko, Jiri Podolsky, Marco Astorino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07537v1)

**Summary:**

As an extension of our previous work [1] (arXiv:2409.02308), we study a complete family of type D black holes with Kerr-like rotation, NUT twist, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and any value of the cosmological constant. We relate various metric forms of these spacetimes, namely those found by Plebanski-Demianski (PD), Griffiths-Podolsky (GP), and most recently Astorino (A)

## 1. Minimal Models RG flows: non-invertible symmetries & non-perturbative   description

**Authors:** Federico Ambrosino, Stefano Negro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07511v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07511v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter we continue the investigation of RG flows between minimal models that are protected by non-invertible symmetries. We introduce a family of non-linear integral equations that appear to encode the exact finite-size, ground-state energies of these flows. This work uncovers a new interplay between exact solvability and non-Invertible symmetry. We also provide a non-trivial test for all the flows conjectured by anomaly matching conditions, but so far not-observed by other means.

## 2. On the solution of the harmonic-divgrad PDEs system

**Authors:** Federico Manzoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07506v1)

**Summary:**

We study a particular system of partial differential equations in which the harmonic, the divergence and the gradient operators of the unknown functions appear. Using the Killing Hopf theorem and leveraging the properties of Riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvature we establish the conditions under which these equations admit only the trivial solutions. The analysis of this particular system is motivated by its occurrence in the study of asymptotic symmetries in $p$-form gauge theories and in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories.

## 3. Exact Dynamical Black Hole Solutions in Five or Higher Dimensions

**Authors:** B. H. Fahim, A. M. Ghezelbash

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07495v1)

**Summary:**

We construct new classes of the dynamical black hole solutions in five or higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. The solutions are non-stationary, and almost conformally regular everywhere. We find three different classes of solutions, based on the values of the coupling constants. We notice that our solutions could be asymptotically de-Sitter, anti-de-Sitters or flat. We also discuss the properties of the solutions, and find the relevant quantities of the Solutions.

## 4. Rationalisation of multiple square roots in Feynman integrals

**Authors:** Georgios Papathanasiou, Stefan Weinzierl, Konglong Wu, Yang Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07490v1)

**Summary:**

Feynman integrals are very often computed from their differential equations. It is well-known that if all square roots are simultaneously rationalisable, the Feynman Integrals can be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. This is a sufficient, but not a necessary criterium. In this paper we investigate weaker requirements. We discuss under which conditions we may use different rationalisations in different parts of the calculation. We present a non-trivial example -- the one-loop pentagon function with three adjacent massive external legs involving seven square roots.

## 5. Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Farèse   extension of Brans-Dicke theory

**Authors:** Shammi Tahura, David A. Nichols, Kent Yagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymPTotic evolution equations. These additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences for the scalar field.

## 6. Instantons with continuous conformal symmetries: Hyperbolic and singular   monopoles and more, oh my!

**Authors:** C. J. Lang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07406v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we comprehensively study instantons with every kind of continuous conformal symmetry. Examples of these objects are hard to come by due to non-linear constraints. By applying previous work on moduli spaces, we introduce a linear constraint, whose solution greatly simplifies these non- linear constraints. We also prove that the basic instanton is essentially the only instanton with two particular kinds of conformal symmetries. We discuss the connections between instantons and other gauge-theoretic objects: hyperbolic and singular monopoles.

## 7. Radiation eikonal for post-Minkowskian observables

**Authors:** Jung-Wook Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07372v1)

**Summary:**

A recent proposal reinterprets the eikonal as the scattering generator, which computes scattering observables through an action as a symmetry generator. The aim of this study is to incorporate dissipative effects from radiation into this framework. The proposed generalisation is tested through several post-Minkowskian scattering observable; scattering waveform, radiated momentum, and (time asymmetric) radiation loss in the impulse. It is hoped that this study will lead to the development of a new type of scattering generator.

## 8. All Order Classical Electromagnetic Soft Theorems

**Authors:** Debanjan Karan, Babli Khatun, Biswajit Sahoo, Ashoke Sen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07328v1)

**Summary:**

If a set of charged objects collide in space and the fragments disperse, then this process will emit electromagnetic waves. Classical soft photon theorem determines the constant term and the leading power law fall-off of the wave-form at late and early times in terms of only the momenta and charges of the incoming and outgoing objects. In this analysis we ignore the effect of long range gravitational interaction, but our result is unaffected by any other short range interactions among the objects. For two-particle scattering, we derive a resummed low-frequency electromagnetic wave- form.

## 9. Novel possible symmetries of $S$-matrix generated by   $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie superalgebras

**Authors:** Ren Ito, Akio Nago

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07311v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we explore the $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie (super)algebras as novel possible generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix. They are natural extensions of Coleman-Mandula theorem and Haag-Lopszanski-Sohnius theorem, which are the no-go theorems for generators of asymmetries. As the results, we demonstrate that a $S#-graded extension of the supersymmetric algebra can be a symmetry.

## 10. Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis: A Short Review

**Authors:** Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07243v1)

**Summary:**

The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has had a profound impact across various fields, from high-energy physics to condensed matter physics. The purpose of this review article is to present the fundamental concepts of quantum equilibrium and the ETH to a broad audience within the physics community. This is particularly for those in high- energy physics who seek a comprehensive understanding of these important topics. The ETH can be found at: http://www.sciencemag.co.uk/news/science/2013/01/29/eigenstate-thermalization-hypothesis.html.

## 11. Dominance of Electric Fields in the Charge Splitting of Elliptic Flow

**Authors:** Ankit Kumar Panda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07240v1)

**Summary:**

The velocity and temperature profiles of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described through thermal model calculations. The electromagnetic field evolution is determined from the solutions of Maxwell's equations, assuming constant electric and chiral conductivities. We find that the slower decay of the electric fields compared to the magnetic fields makes its impact on the splitting of the elliptic flow more dominant. We further estimated that the maximum value of the field values over all spatial points on the hypersurface and across all field components is approximately 0.010003.

## 12. Large charge operators at large spin from relativistically rotating   vortices

**Authors:** Jaehyeok Choi, Eunwoo Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07198v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07198v1)

**Summary:**

We study the ground states of CFTs with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. We find that in the range $Q \ll J \ll Q^2$ the ground state solution is a superfluid densely populated with vortices rotating at a constant angular velocity. In the regime $Q^{3/2}\ll J\ll Q ^2$ our solution achieves lower energy than previously identified states. We obtain the chiral fluctuation modes propagating at the speed of light. We rederive this solution purely from the fluid dynamics.

## 13. Chern-Simons Type Characteristic Classes of Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory

**Authors:** Mengyao Wu, Jie Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07177v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper,we extend the definition of the Chern-Simons type characteristic classes in the continuous case to abelian lattice gauge theory. We show that the exterior differential is exactly equal to the coboundary of the cochain of the (k-1)-th Chern- Simons type characteristics classes based upon the noncommutative differential calculus on the lattice. We also show that a k-th Chern Simons type characteristic class is equivalent to the cochain of a k-2-th characteristic class. We conclude that the  exterior differential of a  k-1-th type characteristic class is equally equal to the cob

## 14. Black Holes and Black Strings in M-theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds with   four Kähler parameters

**Authors:** A. Belhaj, H. Belmahi, A. Bouhouch, S. E. Ennadifi, M. B. Sedra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07167v1)

**Summary:**

We study 5D black branes in the M-theory compactification on a four parameter Calabi-Yau threefold. First, we investigate 5D BPS and non-BPS black holes that are derived by wrapping M2-branes on non-holomorphic 2-cycles. Then, we approach the black hole thermodynamic behavior by computing the entropy and the temperature. Precisely, we find stable and unstable solutions depending on the allowed electric charge regions of the black holes.

## 15. On symmetries of gravitational on-shell boundary action at null infinity

**Authors:** Shivam Upadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07136v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the gravitational boundary action at null infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes. We fix the corner ambiguities in the boundary action by using the constraint that (exponential of) the on-shell action leads to tree-level 5-point amplitude in eikonal approximation in a generic supertranslated vacuum. We also show that an infinite tower of soft theorems can be derived from the action if we consider a 'generalization' of the Geroch tensor.

## 16. Inferring Interpretable Models of Fragmentation Functions using Symbolic   Regression

**Authors:** Nour Makke, Sanjay Chawla

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07123v1)

**Summary:**

Machine learning is rapidly making its path into natural sciences, including high-energy physics. We present the first study that infers, directly from experimental data, a functional form of fragmentation functions. Fragmentation functions can not be calculated in theory and have to be determined instead from data. Traditional approaches rely on global fits of experimental data using a pre-assumed functional form inspired from phenomenological models. This novel approach uses a ML technique, namely symbolic regression, to learn an analytical model from measured charged hadron multiplicities.

## 17. Confinement of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Gauge Theories from M-theory on CY4

**Authors:** Marwan Najjar, Yi-Nan Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07116v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we present a new geometric transition in non-compact Calabi-Yau 4-folds, specifically for the cone over the 7d Sasaki-Einstein manifold. The confining strings are realized as M2-branes wrapping the torsional 1-cycles in this new geometric phase. We have also computed the generalized global symmetries and SymTFT action using the link topology and intersection numbers of the resolved Calabi Yau 4-fold.

## 18. A holographic understanding of correlation and information

**Authors:** Ashis Saha, Anirban Roy Chowdhury, Sunandan Gangopadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07091v1)

**Summary:**

The status of the two-point connected correlator is holographically probed by using the well-known prescription of holographic mutual information. We observe that by considering the standard set up of two strip-like subsystems which are separated by a distance, one can show that there exists two critical separation distances, namely, $sT|_c$ and $s T|_I$ depicting the vanishing of quantum dependencies and classical dependencies between the subsystems respectively. We also make a proposal in this context.

## 19. Impact of dark matter distribution on neutron star properties

**Authors:** Ankit Kumar, Hajime Sotani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07052v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the structural and observable impacts of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars using a combined equation of state that integrates the relativistic mean field (RMF) model for baryonic matter with a variable density profile for DM. Our findings reveal that increased DM concentration significantly enhances NS compactness, shifting mass-radius profiles and reducing tidal deformability. The DM influence strongly depends on the steepness of the DM density profile, where high $\beta$ values lead to strongly confined DM within the NS core.

## 20. Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by   nonHermitian colored noise

**Authors:** Pei Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07050v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse. It is based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases. The model respects statistical Lorentz symmetry.

## 21. Shadow of the Scalar Hairy Black Hole with Inverted Higgs Potential

**Authors:** Kok-Geng Lim, Xiao Yan Chew

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07029v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07029v1)

**Summary:**

We study the imaging of a hairy black hole (HBH) in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory. The HBH can evade the no-hair theorem, bifurcate from the Schwarzschild black hole by acquiring some new properties. The size of the shadow and accretion disk increases as the HBH's horizon increases, but the brightness of the rings remains nearly unaffected. This implies our HBH could potentially mimic the Schwarzfeld black hole if we vary the horizon radius.
