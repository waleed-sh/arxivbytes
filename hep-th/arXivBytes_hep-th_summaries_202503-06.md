## 0. Observables and Unconstrained Spin Tensor Dynamics in General Relativity   from Scattering Amplitudes

**Authors:** Mark Alaverdian, Zvi Bern, Dimitrios Kosmopoulos, Andres Luna, Radu Roiban, Trevor Scheopner, Fei Teng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03739v1)

**Summary:**

In a previous Letter, we showed that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor. In this paper, we provide further details on the physics of these additional degrees. We provide explicit examples -- a Newtonian two-particle bound system and a certain black-hole solution in an exotic matter-coupled gravitational theory. We construct effective two-body Hamiltonians, we demonstrate explicitly that the extra degrees offreedom are necessary to describe the complete dynamics, and we explicitly remove unphysical singularities.

## 1. Noncommutative Phantom BTZ Black Hole

**Authors:** B. Hamil, B. C. Lütfüoğlu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03725v1)

**Summary:**

This work explores the thermodynamic and geometric properties of phantom BTZ black holes. The black hole is analyzed as a thermodynamic heat engine, with its efficiency evaluated as a function of noncommutative parameters. Findings highlight the profound impact ofnoncommutativity on the thermodynamics behavior and efficiency of phantom black holes, revealing new insights into the interplay between quantum spacetime effects and exotic field dynamics. The results indicate that noncommUTative corrections not only modify the stability conditions of these black holes but also play a crucial role in governing phase transitions.

## 2. F-theory with hyperelliptic fibrations

**Authors:** E. Ballico, E. Gasparim, M. P. García del Moral, C. las Heras

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03673v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the role of hyperelliptic fibrations in F-theory. For each even integer $n$ we give a noncompact Calabi--Yau threefold. We show that tadpole cancellation conditions are satisfied for arbitrarily large values of $c_2(X)$. Our explicit examples have split Jacobian, preserving the same number of degrees of freedom of usual F-Theory. But we allow for the appearance of a greater variety of singularities.

## 3. Canonical differential equations for the elliptic two-loop five-point   integral family relevant to $t\bar t +$jet production at leading colour

**Authors:** Matteo Becchetti, Christoph Dlapa, Simone Zoia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03603v1)

**Summary:**

We present differential equations (DEs) in canonical form for a family of two-loop five-point Feynman integrals containing elliptic functions and nested square roots. We write the DEs in terms of one-forms having (locally) simple poles at all singular points, and highlight the `duplet' structure that generalises the even/odd charge of square roots to nested roots. This work represents the first time that a canonical basis of integrals involving elliptic function has been obtained for a five-particle process. It is also a significant step towards next-to-next-to leading order QCD predictions for an important LHC process.

## 4. Dynamical Cosmological Constant

**Authors:** Giuseppe di Donato, Luigi Pilo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03589v1)

**Summary:**

Dynamical realisation of the equation of state $p +\rho =0$ is studied. A non-pathological dynamics for the perturbations of such a system mimicking a dynamical cosmological constant (DCC) is shown. It is shown that an anisotropic stress must be always present. The Hamiltonian of the system in isolation resembles the one of a Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and linear stability requires that it cannot be positive definite. When DCC is minimally coupled to gravity no dramatic instability is present.

## 5. Gauge/Gravity Duality: Recovering the Bulk from the Boundary using   AdS/CFT

**Authors:** Samuel Bilson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03533v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate how the geometry of certain highly symmetric bulk spacetimes can be recovered given information of physical quantities in the dual boundary CFT. Using null and zero-energy spacelike boundary-to-boundary geodesic probes, we show that one can find analytic expressions for extracting the metric functions given boundary data. We find that if the spacetime admits null circular orbits, the bulk geometry can only be recovered from the boundary, down to the radius ofnull circular orbits.

## 6. Exploring non-supersymmetric black holes with multiple bubbles in   five-dimensional minimal supergravity

**Authors:** Ryotaku Suzuki, Shinya Tomizawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03458v1)

**Summary:**

The topological censorship theorem suggests that higher dimensional black holes can possess the domain of outer communication (DOC) of nontrivial topology. In this paper, we seek for a black hole coexisting with two bubbles adjacent to the horizon in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, under the assumptions of stationarity and bi-axisymmetry. We combine the inverse scattering method and the Harrison transformation, and we present the conditions for the absence of conical, orbifold and Dirac-Misner string singularities.

## 7. Holographic derivation of effective action for a dissipative neutral   fluid

**Authors:** Yanyan Bu, Xiyang Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03374v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03374v1)

**Summary:**

Holographic prescription for the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path. The effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid holographically described by the Einstein gravity in an asymptotic AdS spacetime. We adopt a partially on-shell scheme for solving the bulk dynamics. The boundary effective action successfully reproduces various results known in the framework of classical hydrodynamics, confirming our holographic derivation. The goal is achieved by solving the double Dirichlet problem for the linearized gravitational field living in a static AdS black brane background.

## 8. Three-loop chiral effective potential [0.3cm] in the Wess-Zumino model

**Authors:** Buchbinder I. L., Iakhibbaev R. M., Kazakov D. I., Tolkachev D. M

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03358v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the three-loop contribution to the chiral effective potential in the massless Wess-Zumino model. It is shown that while the non-renormalisation theorem forbids divergent contributions, the finite corrections survive. There are only three three- loop supergraphs that give rise to a superfield effective action in the pure chiral sector. Two of them are UV finite while the third requires one-loop counterterm corresponding to theChiral field renormalisation.

## 9. Counting Black Hole Microstates at Future Null Infinity

**Authors:** Vahid Reza Shajiee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03297v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a black hole microstate counting method based on the canonical quantization of the asymptotic symmetries of a two-dimensional dilaton-gravity system at future null infinity. We show that a Cardy-type formula leads to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In this scenario, the quantized bulk degrees of freedom act as a source for the dual field theory operators living at futurenull infinity that are soft gravitons of the higher dimensional system, up to some gauge fixing.

## 10. On covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms: Weakly Isolated   Horizons

**Authors:** Alejandro Corichi, Juan D. Reyes, Tatjana Vukasinac

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03216v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03216v1)

**Summary:**

The Hamiltonian description of classical gauge theories is a well studied subject. The two best known approaches, namely the covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms have received a lot of attention in the literature. In our opinion, a full understanding of the relation between them is not available, specially for gauge theories that are defined over regions with boundaries. We analyze different possible interpretations in both approaches and show how one can obtain complete correspondence between results within both formalisms. Along the way, we shed light on the role of boundary terms in the symplectic structure in relation to boundary degrees of freedom.

## 11. Reconsidering the calculation of the false vacuum decay rate at zero   temperature

**Authors:** Qiang Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03185v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03185v1)

**Summary:**

In the calculation of the decay rate at finite temperature using the saddle point approximation, we identified some inconsistencies. These inconsistencies may impact the explanation provided by Callan and Coleman. To address these inconsistencies, we recalculated the decay rates using the shifted-bounce solution and the shot solution. The results were published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry on November 14, 2013.

## 12. Spacetime perturbations and quasi-teleparallel gravity

**Authors:** Jian Gao, Yuxuan Kang, Mingzhe Li, Yeheng Tong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03119v1)

**Summary:**

Gravity is identical to curved spacetime. It is manifested by the curvature of a Riemannian spacetime in general relativity but by torsion or non-metricity in teleparallel gravity models. In this paper, we apply these multiple options to the spacetime perturbation theory and seek the possibilities of representing the gravitation of the background and that of theperturbation in separate ways. We show that the perturbations around a R Siemannian background can be described by torion ornon-metrics.

## 13. Quantum Magic in Quantum Electrodynamics

**Authors:** Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03098v1)

**Summary:**

In quantum computing, non-stabilizerness -- the magic -- refers to the computational advantage of certain quantum states over classical computers. We study the production of magic states in Quantum Electrodynamics via 2-to-2 scattering processes involving electrons and muons. In most cases the largest magic generated is significantly less than the maximal possible value of $\log (16/7) \approx 0.827$. Our results suggest QED, although capable of producing maximally entangled states easily, may not be an efficient mechanism for generating quantum advantages.

## 14. Non-Affine Extensions of the Raychaudhuri Equation in the K-essence   Framework

**Authors:** Samit Ganguly, Goutam Manna, Debashis Gangopadhyay, Eduardo Guendelman, Abhijit Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03076v1)

**Summary:**

The Raychaudhuri equation (RE) governs the evolution of geodesic congruences in curved spacetime. Here, we extend the classical RE by incorporating non-affine parametrization within the framework of k-essence scalar field dynamics. The results suggest a deep connection between scalar fields dynamics and modified gravity, offering new perspectives on the nature of the universe's expansion history. We reinterpret the modified RE as an anti-damped harmonic oscillator, revealing quantum-like effects in cosmic expansion.
