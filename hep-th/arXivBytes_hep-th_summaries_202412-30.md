## 0. Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet   systems

**Authors:** Nikita Kolganov, Dmitrii A. Trunin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19797v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of KrylovChain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients) We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.

## 1. Composite operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills

**Authors:** Agnese Bissi, Giulia Fardelli, Andrea Manenti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19788v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19788v1)

**Summary:**

We use superconformal symmetry to disentangle the contribution of protected operators in the partial wave decomposition. With this information, we fix the non protected part of such correlators up to subleading order in the large central charge expansion. We particularly focus on the triple-trace sector of the correlator and comment on the connection to the holographic description of these correlators.

## 2. Cosmological perturbations meet Wheeler DeWitt

**Authors:** Federico Piazza, Siméon Vareilles

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782v1)

**Summary:**

We study solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation in order to recover standard results of cosmological perturbation theory. In mini-superspace, we introduce a dimensionless gravitational coupling that is typically very small. By using the semiclassical limit we express the relation between the wavefunction of the universe and the perturbative wavefunction. We discuss possible deviations from the classical background trajectory as well as the higher derivative terms that are present in the WdW equation.

## 3. Symbolic Approximations to Ricci-flat Metrics Via Extrinsic Symmetries   of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces

**Authors:** Viktor Mirjanić, Challenger Mishra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19778v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19778v1)

**Summary:**

Finding Ricci-flat metrics remains a major obstacle to development of string theory and algebraic geometry. Recent computational approaches employ machine learning to create novel representations for approximating these metrics. We show that such symmetries uniquely determine the flat metric on certain loci, for which we present an analytic form. We also incorporate our theoretical results into neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art reductions in Ricci curvature for multiple Calabi-Yau manifolds. We conclude by distilling the ML models to obtain for the first time closed form expressions for Kahler metrics with near-zero scalar curvature.

## 4. On the uplift of 4D wormholes in Braneworld models and their 5D   structure

**Authors:** Thomas Pappas, Theodoros Nakas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19773v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we derive the general conditions that the metric functions of any braneworld spacetime must satisfy to describe a wormhole structure in the bulk. Particular emphasis is placed on clarifying the proper uplift of 4D wormholes, expressed in terms of various radial coordinates on the brane. We demonstrate the important role of the circumferential radius metric function for the embedding. The assumption of a warped extra dimension has non-trivial implications for the structure of 5D worm holes.

## 5. Classification of Minimal Abelian Coulomb Branches

**Authors:** Antoine Bourget, Quentin Lamouret, Sinan Moura Soysüren, Marcus Sperling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19766v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19766v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we derive a full classification for such Abelian quivers with arbitrary charges, and identify all possible Coulomb branch geometries. We give two proofs, one which uses the decay and fission algorithm, and another one relying only on explicit computations involving 3d mirror symmetry. In the process, we put forward a method for computing the 3D mirror of any gauge theory, which is sensitive to discrete gauge factors in the mirror theory. This constitutes a confirmation for the decayandfission algorithm.

## 6. Nonlinear trident using WKB and worldline instantons

**Authors:** Gianluca Degli Esposti, Greger Torgrimsson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19758v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19758v1)

**Summary:**

We consider nonlinear trident in various electric background fields. This process has so far been studied for plane-wave backgrounds, using Volkov solutions. Here we first use WKB for trident for time-dependent electric fields, and then for fields which vary slowly in space. Then we show how to use worldline instantons for more general fields which depend on both time and space. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from. Back To The page you come from.

## 7. IR Bounds on Theories with Spontaneously-Broken Lorentz Symmetry

**Authors:** Francesco Serra, Leonardo G. Trombetta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19745v1)

**Summary:**

In nature, some UV features of the dynamics are reflected in IR quantities. In fully relativistic theories, this connection can be probed through the analyticity properties of scattering amplitudes. These results suggest a way to study the UV/IR connection in more complex theories, say the authors of a new paper in the journal Physical Review Letters. They say the results suggest that gapped excitations have a slower speed than gapless ones, at least for momenta that are low with respect to the mass gap.

## 8. Nonperturbative Lorentz Violation and Field Quantization

**Authors:** Alan Kostelecky, Ralf Lehnert, Marco Schreck, Babak Seradjeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19733v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19733v1)

**Summary:**

Lorentz-violating effective field theories are studied in which departures from Lorentz symmetry are nonperturbative. The absence of an observer-invariant energy-positivity condition requires physical input beyond the free theory for the unambiguous identification of a ground state. An investigation of the role of thermodynamics in this context is instigated. It is shown that conventional methods suffice to achieve field quantization and Fock-space construction. However, the absence of a thermodynamics condition requires a physical input.

## 9. Quantum correlations in a gravitational collapse simulation with   SpheriCo.jl

**Authors:** Benjamin Berczi, Magdalena Eriksson, Thanasis Giannakopoulos, Paul M. Saffin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19722v1)

**Summary:**

SpheriCo.jl is a code that computes gravitational collapse of a spherical scalar field. The scalar can be either a classical field, or a quantum field operator. The code is also used to compute two-point correlation functions, with results that hint at a non-trivial correlation across the horizon of Hawking quanta. We are able to observe critical behavior of gravitational collapse for the classical setup, in agreement with expected results. We present a suite of tests for the code that tests its accuracy and stability.

## 10. Schwinger pair production in spacetime fields: Moiré patterns,   Aharonov-Bohm phases and Sturm-Liouville eigenvalues

**Authors:** Gianluca Degli Esposti, Greger Torgrimsson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19709v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19709v1)

**Summary:**

We use a worldline-instanton formalism to study the momentum spectrum of Schwinger pair production in spacetime fields with multiple stationary points. We show that the interference structure changes fundamentally when going from purely time-dependent to space-time-dependent fields. We also study complex momentum saddle points in order to obtain the integrated probability from the spectrum. Finally, we calculate an asymptotic expansion for the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville equation that corresponds to the saddle-point approximation of the worldline path integral.

## 11. Reparameterization Invariance of FRW Model: Supervariable and BRST   Approaches

**Authors:** B. Chauhan, R. Tripathi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19704v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19704v1)

**Summary:**

We perform the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization of a (0 + 1)-dimensional non-interacting cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model. We use the modified Bonora-Tonin supervariable approach (MBTSA) to BRST formalism. We also establish the (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF)-type restriction for this model.

## 12. Love Numbers for Extremal Kerr Black Hole

**Authors:** Malcolm Perry, Maria J. Rodriguez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19699v1)

**Summary:**

We perform a detailed study of the gravitational tidal Love numbers of extremal zero-temperature Kerr black holes. These coefficients are finite and exhibit the dissipative nature of these maximally spinning black hole. We provide explicit expressions of the Love numbers at low frequencies. Their calculation is simplified to specific formulas, which are directly derived using the Leaver-MST methods.

## 13. Continuous majorization in quantum phase space with Wigner negativity

**Authors:** Jan de Boer, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Erik Tonni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698v1)

**Summary:**

In discrete variable quantum computation, stabilizer operations naturally produce an order between input and output states. The order results in inequalities for magic monotones. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. This concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023) In this work, we develop the theory of continuousmajorization in the general $N$- mode case.

## 14. Casimir Radial Parts via Matsuki Decomposition

**Authors:** Philip Schlösser, Mikhail Isachenkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19681v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19681v1)

**Summary:**

We use Matsuki's decomposition for symmetric pairs of reductive Lie groups to construct the radial parts for differential operators acting on matrix-spherical functions. As an application, we employ this machinery to formulate an alternative, mathematically rigorous approach to obtaining radial parts of Casimir operators that appear in the theory of conformal blocks. We argue that Matsuki’s decomposition provides a proper mathematical framework for analysing the correspondence between Casimir equations and the Calogero-Sutherland-type models.

## 15. Mixed state entanglement in deformed field theory at finite temperature

**Authors:** Sanjay Pant, Himanshu Parihar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19680v1)

**Summary:**

We study mixed state entanglement measures in a higher dimensional $T\bar{T}$ deformed field theory at finite temperature. The holographic dual is described by AdS$_{d+1}$ black brane geometry with a finite cut-off. The behavior of EWCS and HEN is studied across different regimes of temperature and deformation parameter. It is observed that the deformation and temperature exhibit similar effects on these two entanglements measures. Increasing theDeformation leads to a decrease in the entangler between the subsystems.

## 16. DLScanner: A parameter space scanner package assisted by deep learning   methods

**Authors:** A. Hammad, Raymundo Ramos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19675v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we introduce a scanner package enhanced by deep learning (DL) techniques. The proposed package addresses two significant challenges associated with previously developed DL-based methods: slow convergence in high-dimensional scans and limited generalization of the DL network when mapping random points to the target space. Our proposed framework demonstrates substantial gains in both performance and efficiency compared to other scanning methods. We employ a VEGAS mapping to adaptively suggest new points for theDL network while also improving the mapping when more points are collected.

## 17. Spectral form factors for curved spacetimes with horizon

**Authors:** Dmitry S. Ageev, Vasilii V. Pushkarev, Anastasia N. Zueva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19672v1)

**Summary:**

The spectral form factor is believed to provide a special type of behavior called "dip-ramp-plateau" in chaotic quantum systems. A similar behavior could be observed for deterministic systems, ranging from the Riemann zeta function to the scattering amplitudes of different types. It has been shown recently, the same behavior is observed for the spectral form Factor when the normal modes of a scalar massless field theory are substituted as eigenvalues of some quantum Hamiltonian.

## 18. Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$α$ and H$β$ active   galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic   and broad H$α$ luminosities

**Authors:** Shulei Cao, Amit Kumar Mandal, Michal Zajaček, Bożena Czerny, Bharat Ratra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665v1)

**Summary:**

We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmologists. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmologically probe.

## 19. Minimal dark matter in $SU(5)$ grand unification

**Authors:** Takashi Toma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19660v1)

**Summary:**

Minimal dark matter is an attractive candidate for dark matter because it is stabilized without the need to impose additional symmetries. We embed the quintuplet dark matter within non-supersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand unified theories. Our model can be tested through comprehensive searches for colored sextet fermions in collider experiments, as well as through indirect and direct detection methods for minimal dark matter. It is known that the mass of the $ SU(2)_L$ quintuplets is predicted to be around 14 TeV.

## 20. Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry

**Authors:** Zhian Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19657v1)

**Summary:**

We develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of aweak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state. The model is inspired by a weak hopf algebra generalized to a tensor product Hilbert space. It is based on symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT)

## 21. O-vertex, O7$^+$-plane, and Topological Vertex

**Authors:** Sung-Soo Kim, Xiaobin Li, Futoshi Yagi, Rui-Dong Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19655v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the instanton partition function for 5d gauge theories compactified on S$^1$, computed from the topological vertex formalism with the O-vertex based on a 5-brane web diagram with an O5-plane. We introduce an identity that enables us to rewrite the unrefined partition function into a new expression in terms of the Nekrasov factors summed over Young diagrams, which can be interpreted as the freezing of an O7-planes. Based on this, we propose topological vertices with O7$^+$-planes.

## 22. Celestial Quantum Error Correction II: From Qudits to Celestial CFT

**Authors:** Alfredo Guevara, Yangrui Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19653v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19653v1)

**Summary:**

A holographic CFT description of asymptotically flat spacetimes inherits vacuum degeneracies and IR divergences from its gravitational dual. We devise a Quantum Error Correcting (QEC) framework to encode both effects as correctable fluctuations on the CFT dual. The framework is physically motivated by embedding a chain of qudits in the so-called Klein spacetime and then taking a continuum $N\to \infty$ limit. The limit results in hard states with quantized BMS hair in the celestial torus forming the logical subspace, robust under soft radiation.

## 23. Branes and Representations of DAHA $C^\vee C_1$: affine braid group   action on category

**Authors:** Junkang Huang, Satoshi Nawata, Yutai Zhang, Shutong Zhuang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19647v1)

**Summary:**

We study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra. We show a one-to-one correspondence between Lagrangian $A$-branes with compact support. The $D_4$ root system plays an essential role in understanding both the geometry and representation theory. As a by-product, our geometric investigation offers detailed information about the low-energy dynamics of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ Seiberg-Witten theory.

## 24. Gravity From a Color Symmetry II: Celestial Color Kinematics for Mass   and Spin

**Authors:** Alfredo Guevara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19641v1)

**Summary:**

A realization of gravitational amplitudes based in the large $N$ limit of a certain 2d $SU(N)$ Kac-Moody theory has been recently proposed. We relate this proposal to Color Kinematics (CK) duality and present an extension to EFT amplitudes for matter particles with any mass and spin. We argue that in the limit $S\to\infty$ these states correspond to the Kerr black hole and we rediscover a classical $w_{1+\ infty}$ action of Penrose.

## 25. Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and   the K-identities

**Authors:** Sheng-Hong Lai, Jen-Chi Lee, Yi Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases. We propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringyScale behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-Identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K- identities for some higher point HSSA .

## 26. On one-loop amplitudes in gauge theories

**Authors:** Qu Cao, Jin Dong, Song He, Fan Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19629v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a new expansion for one-loop amplitudes with arbitrary number of gluons in $D$ dimensions. It holds for general gauge theories withgluons/fermions/scalars in the loop, including pure and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. It expresses the $n$-gluon amplitudes as a linear combination of universal scalar- loop amplitudes. We present closed-formula for these one- loop integrands and prove them by showing that the single cuts are correctly reproduced.

## 27. An Exact Black Hole Scattering Amplitude

**Authors:** Alfredo Guevara, Uri Kol, Huy Tran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19627v1)

**Summary:**

General Relativity famously predicts precession of orbital motions in the Schwarzschild metric. We show that by adding a NUT charge $N = iM$ the precession vanishes to all orders in $G$ even for rotating black holes. We conjecture a generalization of the eikonal formula and show that the classical integrable trajectories determine the full quantum amplitude for this black hole. Several consequences of integrability in self-dual gravity are discussed. We also conjecture that the quantum amplitude of a black hole can be determined by means of exponentiation of the Post-Minkowskian radial action.

## 28. An impediment to torsion from spectral geometry

**Authors:** Arkadiusz Bochniak, Ludwik Dąbrowski, Andrzej Sitarz, Paweł Zalecki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626v1)

**Summary:**

No convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the Torsion shall be excluded from the consideration of general relativity. We conclude that there are no convincing arguments to support the inclusion of theTorsion in a general relativity model.

## 29. Newman-Janis Algorithm from Taub-NUT Instantons

**Authors:** Joon-Hwi Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19611v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the Kerr metric represents a pair of self-dual gravitational dyons (Taub-NUT instantons) The Newman-Janis algorithm precisely originates from this fact. More generally, this program of understanding four-dimensional black holes as systems of chiral dyons extends to Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Taub -NUT solutions as well. We show that this program also extends to the Kerr-Kerr and Kerr Kerr NUT problems.

## 30. Elliptic triad

**Authors:** A. Mironov, A. Morozov, A. Popolitov, Z. Zakirova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19588v1)

**Summary:**

The triad refers to embedding the Macdonald polynomials into the Noumi-Shiraishi functions. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory. The central unknown ingredient is linear equations. We discuss various possible approaches, including immediate elliptic deformation of periodicity conditions and (elliptic) Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra operators. We also discuss lifting the triad to an elliptic generalization of the Nouimi-Shirahis functions.

## 31. Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories:   Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their   descriptions by (mock) modular covariant

**Authors:** Yoshiki Fukusumi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577v1)

**Summary:**

We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase.

## 32. Superintegrability of the Wilson family of matrix models and moments of   multivariable orthogonal polynomials

**Authors:** Victor Mishnyakov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19574v1)

**Summary:**

We present new examples of superintegrable matrix/eigenvalue models. These examples arise as a result of the exploration of the relationship between the theory of superIntegrability and multivariate orthogonal polynomials. The new examples are built upon the multivariate generalizations of the Meixner-Pollaczek and Wilson polynmials and their respective measures. We propose expressions for (generalized) moments of the respective multi-variable measures. From the perspective ofsuperintegrability we uncover a couple of new phenomena.

## 33. Nonminimally coupled Dark Matter in Clusters of Galaxies: a fully   comprehensive analysis

**Authors:** Saboura Zamani, Vincenzo Salzano, Dario Bettoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19569v1)

**Summary:**

A non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can affect the behavior of dark matter in galaxy clusters. We have considered the case of a disformal coupling, which leads to a modification of the Poisson equation. We aim to constrain the key parameter in our model, the characteristic coupling length. Our findings show that the coupling length is typically very small, thus being fully consistent with general relativity, although with an upper limit at $1\sigma$ which is of the order of $100$ kpc.

## 34. Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the   Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model

**Authors:** Reyhan Ay, Adipta Pal, Ashley M. Cook

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19568v1)

**Summary:**

Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields.

## 35. Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect

**Authors:** Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE) In essence, a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$ may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. We identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification.

## 36. Revisiting 3-Sasakian and $G_2$-structures

**Authors:** Simon Salamon, Ragini Singhal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19525v1)

**Summary:**

The algebra of exterior differential forms on a regular 3-Sasakian 7-manifold is investigated. This is applied to the study of 3-forms invariant under cohomogeneity-one actions by $SO(4)$ on the 7-sphere and on Berger's space $ SO(5)/SO(3)$. The study of $G_2$ 3- forms is also applied to this study. The algebra of 5-forms is investigated, with special reference to nearly-parallel $G-2# 3-form.

## 37. HBT interferometry and Quantum Detection of Primordial Gravitational   Waves in Hořava-Lifshitz Gravity

**Authors:** Sugumi Kanno, Hiroki Matsui, Shinji Mukohyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514v1)

**Summary:**

Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity is recognized as a renormalizable, unitary, and asymptotically free quantum field theory of gravity. One of its cosmological predictions is that it can produce scale-invariant primordial density fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves without relying on inflation. In this paper, we investigate the quantum nature of the prim Primordial gravitational waves generated in Ho\v {r}.ava Lif Shitz gravity.

## 38. Oscillons in AdS space

**Authors:** Takaaki Ishii, Takaki Matsumoto, Kanta Nakano, Ryosuke Suda, Kentaroh Yoshida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19468v1)

**Summary:**

We study oscillons in a real scalar field theory in a (3+1)-dimensional AdS space with global coordinates. The initial configuration is given by a Gaussian shape with an appropriate core size as in Minkowski spacetime. The solution exhibits a long lifetime. We discuss some potential applications of the oscillon in the context of AdS/CFT duality. In particular, we show that the recurrence phenomenon can be observed under suitable conditions. We conclude with a discussion of the potential applications for AdS and CFT dualities.

## 39. Pulse-induced memory-like effect in cyclotron motion?

**Authors:** Sayan Kar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19460v1)

**Summary:**

A pulse-induced 'electromagnetic memory-like effect' is observed. The effect is not quite a wave memory, but has similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context. The magnitude of the velocity undergoes a change too, akin to a 'velocity kick' The results suggest a pulse- induced 'electron memory- like effect', which is notquite a 'wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similarfeatures within asimple, non -relativist context.

**Authors:** Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454v1)

**Summary:**

The circular version of the Unruh effect can be significant even at very small centripetal accelerations, say the researchers. This finding sheds new light on the experimental detection of the circular UnruH effect, they say. The study was published in the journal Physical Review Letters. The authors say the research was conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the lab of physicist  David Bennett. They say the study was conducted on atoms rotating in a circular orbit in vacuum.

## 41. Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems

**Authors:** Simon Lyakhovich, nikit Sinelnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations restricting the trajectory. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from a requirement that this gauge variation ofThe action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not Lagrangian as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket.

## 42. On the Symmetry of Odd Leech Lattice CFT

**Authors:** Masaki Okada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19430v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the Mathieu groups do not lift to subgroups of the automorphism group of the odd Leech lattice. This study is motivated by the moonshine-type observation on the extremal elliptic genus of central charge 24 by [Benjamin, Dyer, Fitzpatrick, Kachru arXiv:1507.00004]. We also investigate weight-1 and weight-$\frac{3}{2}$ currents invariant under the subgroup.

## 43. QCD axion dark matter in the dark dimension

**Authors:** Hai-Jun Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19426v1)

**Summary:**

The recently proposed dark dimension scenario reveals that the axions can be localized on the Standard Model brane. At this scale, the QCD axion constitutes a minor fraction of the total cold dark matter (DM) density. In this work, we investigate the issue of QCDAxion DM within the context of the dark dimension and demonstrate that the Q CD axion in this scenario can account for the entire DM abundance through a simple two-axion mixing mechanism. We find that, in a scenario where the ALP possesses a mass of approximately $m_A \sim 10^{-5} \, \rm eV$ and a decay constant of $f_A  10^{11}  $, the

## 44. The lack of influence of the scalar hair on the DC conductivity

**Authors:** Ulises Hernandez-Vera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19388v1)

**Summary:**

Black hole solutions within the framework of beyond-Horndeski theories are generalized in the presence of two axionic fields. We show that, despite the explicit dependence of the scalar field and the metric on the primary hair, this latter does not directly affect the calculation of transport properties. Its influence is indirect, modifying the horizon location, but the transport properties themselves do not explicitly depend on the hair parameter. This result underscores the robustness of our earlier findings, and seem to confirm that the transport Properties remain unaffected by the explicit presence of the hair parameters.
