## 0. Non-factorizable Superamplitudes for Massive N = 1 Superstates

**Authors:** Antonio Delgado, Adam Martin, Runqing Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08741v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08741v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study non-factorizable N = 1 superamplitudes for massive chiral superstates. This technique does not depend on whether or not the superstates are self-conjugate. We demonstrate how little group scaling and the supersymmetric Ward identities determine the form of non-Factorizable massless super amplitudes. We then extrapolate to massive superam plitudes by requiring they reduce to the massless form when we send all masses to zero. The results are published in the online edition of Theoretical Physics.

## 1. Gravitational signatures of a nonlinear electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$   gravity

**Authors:** A. A. Araújo Filho, N. Heidari, I. P. Lobo, V. B. Bezerra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08718v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate a nonlinear electrodynamics model within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. We begin by outlining the general features of the theory and analyzing the event horizon under conditions ensuring its real and positive definiteness. We then examine light trajectories, focusing on critical orbits, shadow radii, and geodesics of massless particles. Finally, we examine additional topological aspects, including topological thermodynamics and the topological photon sphere.

## 2. Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth   radiation bounce

**Authors:** Federico Piazza, Siméon Vareilles

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703v1)

**Summary:**

We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum cosmology. We propose restricting to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model highlights a bouncing behavior. We argue that the inevitable time dependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de Sitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch of radiation domination near the singularity.

## 3. A novel view of the flavor-singlet spectrum from multi-flavor QCD on the   lattice

**Authors:** Yasumichi Aoki, Tatsumi Aoyama, Ed Bennett, Toshihide Maskawa, Kohtaroh Miura, Hiroshi Ohki, Enrico Rinaldi, Akihiro Shibata, Koichi Yamawaki, Takeshi Yamazaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08658v1)

**Summary:**

 SU(3) gauge theories with increasing number of light fermions are the templates of strongly interacting sectors. studying their low-energy dynamics and spectrum is important for understanding the strong dynamics of QCD itself. We present a complete lattice study of both these flavor-singlet channels on high-statistics gauge ensembles generated by the LatKMI collaboration with 4, 8, and 12 copies of light mass-degenerate fermion. We also present other hadron masses on the lightest ensemble for $N_f=8$ and discuss the chiral extrapolation of the spectrum.

## 4. Comments on the de Sitter Double Cone

**Authors:** Zhenbin Yang, Yuzhen Zhang, Wenwen Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08647v1)

**Summary:**

We study the double cone geometry proposed by Saad, Shenker, and Stanford in de Sitter space. We demonstrate that with the inclusion of static patch observers, thedouble cone leads to a linear ramp consistent with random matrix behavior. This ramp arises from the relative time shift between two clocks located in opposite static patches. We show that the linear ramp is consistent with the behavior of a random matrix. We present our results in a paper published in the Journal of Mathematical Theory and Mechanics.

## 5. Symmetry Transmutation and Anomaly Matching

**Authors:** Nathan Seiberg, Sahand Seifnashri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08618v1)

**Summary:**

A global symmetry of the ultraviolet (UV) theory does not act faithfully on the local infrared (IR) degrees of freedom, but instead acts effectively as a higher-form symmetry. We refer to this phenomenon as symmetry transmutation. We illustrate the ubiquity of this phenomenon in various continuum and lattice systems and provide examples where the 't Hooft anomalies of the UV symmetry are matched by those of the new higher form symmetry in the IR. We also show that in certain phases and for certain energies, the UV baryon-number symmetry of one-flavor QCD is transmuted into a discrete one-form global symmetry.

## 6. Holographic geometry/real-space entanglement correspondence and metric   reconstruction

**Authors:** Xuanting Ji, Xin-Xiang Ju, Ya-Wen Sun, Yuan-Tai Wang, He-Lin Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08534v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08534v1)

**Summary:**

In holography, the boundary entanglement structure is believed to be encoded in the bulk geometry. In this work, we investigate the precise correspondence between the boundary real-spaceEntanglement and the bulk geography. Inspired by this correspondence, we propose a new method of bulk metric reconstruction from boundary Entanglement data. The CMI reconstruction method establishes a connection between the differential entropy prescription and Bilson's general algorithm for metric reconstruction. We propose to specify the function $z_*(l)$ as the criterion for a gauge choice, and with the specified gauge function, we verify the exact correspondence.

## 7. What can solve the Strong CP problem?

**Authors:** David E. Kaplan, Tom Melia, Surjeet Rajendran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08358v1)

**Summary:**

Three strategies have been advocated to solve the strong CP problem. The first is the axion, a dynamical mechanism that relaxes any initial value of the CP violating angle to zero. The second is the imposition of new symmetries that are believed to set $\bar{\theta}$ to zero in the UV. The third is the acceptance of the fine tuning of parameters. We argue that the latter two solutions do not solve theStrong CP Problem. Our results considerably strengthen the case for the existence of theAxion and axion dark matter.

## 8. Capacity of Entanglement in Lifshitz Theories

**Authors:** Sare Khoshdooni, Komeil Babaei Velni, M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08297v1)

**Summary:**

We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. We explore various aspects of capacity of Entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of otherEntanglement measures including the entanglements entropy.

## 9. A study on the properties of hidden-charm pentaquarks with double   strangeness

**Authors:** Xuejie Liu, Yue Tan, Xiaoyun Chen, Dianyong Chen, Hongxia Huang, Jialun Ping

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08207v1)

**Summary:**

We systematically investigate the hidden-charm double-strange pentaquark system. We use the resonating group method within the quark delocalization color screening model (QDCSM) Five resonance states are identified with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2$-$. Their masses, widths, and dominant decay channels are predicted, providing critical guidance for future experimental searches.

## 10. Correlators in two rainbow tensor and complex multi-matrix models

**Authors:** Bei Kang, Lu-Yao Wang, Ke Wu, Wei-Zhong Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08132v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08132v1)

**Summary:**

We construct two rainbow tensor models with multi-tensors of rank-$3$ and present their $W$-representations. We give the formula of counting number of independent gauge-invariant operators in terms of Hurwitz numbers. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between connected operators and colored Dessins. We derive two compact expressions of correlators for each of rainbow Tensor models. Two complex multi-matrix models from the degradations of the constructed rainbow Tensors are also discussed.
