## 0. Rescuing 331 bileptons from the Landau pole

**Authors:** Stefano Morisi, Giovanna Paola Perdonà, Giulia Ricciardi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15785v1)

**Summary:**

Bileptons are doubly charged gauge bosons. They are predicted by several Standard Model extensions, including the so-called 331 models. The minimal formulation of these models is generally plagued by a "low energy" Landau pole. We analyze this issue and investigate the possibility to shift the Landau Pole at higher energy scales by extending the troublesome minimal 331 models, we say. We conclude that this could lead to new predictions for TeV-scale bilePTons. The study is published in the open-access journal Science.

## 1. Gravitational Bremsstrahlung in Black-Hole Scattering at   $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$: Quadratic-in-Spin Effects

**Authors:** Lara Bohnenblust, Harald Ita, Manfred Kraus, Johannes Schlenk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15724v1)

**Summary:**

We are employing a supersymmetric variant of the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) formalism to compute the far-field momentum-space gravitational waveform emitted during the scattering of two spinning black holes. Our results are accurate up to quadratic-in-spin contributions, which means we report for the very first time the waveform observable at the order $O(G^3\mathcal{S}^2)$. We find exact agreement for the NLO waveform integrand obtained from the WQFT and the classical limit of scattering amplitudes in QFT.

## 2. Detector Based Evaluation of Extractable Entanglement in Flat spacetime

**Authors:** Hiromasa Tajima, Riku Yoshimoto, Ryo Nemoto, Yuki Osawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15716v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15716v1)

**Summary:**

Entanglement entropy (EE) is widely used to quantify quantum correlations in field theory. It remains unclear how much of the entanglement is physically extractable via local measurements. This work provides an operational perspective on field-theoretic Entanglement. It sets fundamental limits on its extractability and provides a new perspective on quantum field theory in the 21st century. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal (ASJ) (http://www. astrophysicaljournal.com/ASJ/2013/01/21/astrophysics-journal.html)

## 3. Entanglement of Inhomogeneous Free Bosons and Orthogonal Polynomials

**Authors:** Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Gilles Parez, Eric Ragoucy, David Raveh, Luc Vinet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15610v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. We find a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results, finding a perfect matching between the analytical and numerical results.

## 4. Hyperscaling of Fidelity and Operator Estimations in the Critical   Manifold

**Authors:** Matheus Henrique Martins Costa, Flavio de Souza Nogueira, Jeroen van den Brink

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15566v1)

**Summary:**

We show that ground-state expectation values of observables supported on slow momentum modes can be approximated by their averages on the fixed-point theories to which the QFTs flow. This is done by studying the fidelity between ground states and arriving at certain hyperscaling relations satisfied at criticality. Our results allow for a clear identification of cases in which one can replace a QFT by its scale-invariant limit in the calculation of expectation values, opening the way for the application of numerical and analytical methods to as of yet difficult computer simulation of critical models.

## 5. A fast deep-learning approach to probing primordial black hole   populations in gravitational wave events

**Authors:** Jun-Qian Jiang, Hai-Long Huang, Jibin He, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15530v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBHs) may contribute to the part of the gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. Traditional Bayesian analysis relies on precise GW-event posterior estimates. We present a fast deep-learning framework, leveraging Transformer and normalizing flows, that maps GW- event posterior samples to joint posterior distributions over the PBH population. Our approach yields accurate credible intervals while reducing end-to-end inference time to $O(1)$ s on a single GPU.

## 6. $φ^3$ theory at six loops

**Authors:** Oliver Schnetz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15485v1)

**Summary:**

We present the renormalization functions of dimensionally regularized $\phi^3$ theory in six dimensions up to loop order six in the minimal subtraction scheme. We show that these functions are renormalized in six different ways. We also show that this theory can be generalized to other dimensions. We conclude that this is the most general way to generalize the theory to six different dimensions. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Back To the pageYou Came From.

## 7. A Falsifiable Alternative to General Relativity

**Authors:** Daniel Coumbe, Aria Rahmaty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15399v1)

**Summary:**

Asymptotically Weyl-invariant gravity (AWIG) is a power-counting renormalizable alternative to general relativity (GR) An expression for the dimensionless exponent n(R) is derived based on dynamical dimensional reduction. We show that this version of AWIG naturally resolves several theoretical issues normally associated with the Palatini formalism. A falsifiable prediction regarding the frequency of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is made. A preliminary analysis of gravitational wave GW150914 yields a maximum tension of 0.9° with GR and marginally favours AWIG.

## 8. Numerical simulations on First-order phase transition through thermal   fluctuation

**Authors:** Ligong Bian, Yuefeng Di, Yongtao Jia, Yang Li, Kehao Zeng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15360v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15360v1)

**Summary:**

In this Letter, we numerically present the possibility of the first-order phase transition occurring through the thermal fluctuation in the early universe. We find that when the temperature is slightly higher than the mass scale of the background field, the bubble-like field configurations appear proceeded by oscillons, which expand and collide to finish the phase transition. We provide the false vacuum decay rate and the accompanied gravitational waves. We also present the vacuum phase transition comparison of the quantum tunneling case and Thermal fluctuation case.

## 9. Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at   finite temperature and chemical potential

**Authors:** Nikesh Lilani, Nikesh Lilani, Subhash Mahapatra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping.

## 10. A note on the calculation of the Komar integral in the Lorentzian   Taub-NUT spacetime

**Authors:** Gabriele Barbagallo, José Luis V. Cerdeira, Carmen Gómez-Fayrén, Tomás Ortín

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15349v1)

**Summary:**

We show how the same results are obtained when the Mister-string singularities are removed by using Misner's procedure. Different choices of hypersurfaces may contain different strings and lead to different physics, though. We show how, even though the complete spacetime has no such singularities anymore, they are unavoidable in all spacelike hypersurfaced which are used in the Komar integrals. We also show how to remove the singularities from the Lorentzian Taub--NUT spacetime.

## 11. A Deep Dive into classical and Topological CFT Thermodynamics in   Lifshitz and Hyperscaling Violating Black Holes

**Authors:** Mohammad Ali S. Afshar, Mohammad Reza Alipour, Saeed Noori Gashti, Jafar Sadeghi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15314v1)

**Summary:**

Holographic dictionary for Lifshitz black holes and hyperscaling violation (HSV) models has provided an essential foundation for studying CFT thermodynamics and phase behavior of these black holes. Based on this framework, we will investigate their thermodynamic properties using two distinct approaches. In the first step, we adopt the classical and traditional method, examining the behavior of the free energy function as a function of temperature near the critical boundary. By analyzing its behavior, we then proceed to evaluate the stability of the models. We will analyze phase behavior through the lens of topological charges.

## 12. Vacuum Tunneling from Conifold Transitions in IIB

**Authors:** Xin Gao, Qinjian Lou, Yi-Nan Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15305v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the quantum tunneling process through a topology transition near a conifold singularity, in the setup of IIB CY3 orientifold compactification. We find that it is difficult to achieve a significantly large tunneling rate in the controllable regime. We propose a novel method to do moduli stabilization in an extended moduli space, parametrized by both the geometric moduli and the light D3-brane wrapping modes arisen from the brane quantization.

## 13. Singularities of Magnetic Monopoles for Dirac and 't Hooft-Polyakov   Theories by Pre-potential Method

**Authors:** Masakatsu Kenmoku

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15301v1)

**Summary:**

The magnetic monopole is one of the important problems in the early stage of universe as well as observations and experiments on Earth. We assert that the magnetic singularity exists for the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole in SO(3) gauge theory, and for the Dirac monopole. The regularization method confirms our assertion. We use the pre-potential to study the existence or non-existence of the monopole theories using the curl operation to derive the vector potential.

## 14. Canonical Structure and Hidden Symmetries in Scalar Field Cosmology

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15207v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. We construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of transformations can relate the solution spaces of different models, such as of the scalarField and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.

## 15. Geometric duality between effective field theories I: scattering   amplitudes

**Authors:** Tomas Brauner, Yang Li, Diederik Roest, Tianzhi Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15199v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel type of duality that connects a sequence of well-known theories with even-multiplicity scalar amplitudes. It relates the Yang-Mills theory coupled to a specific scalar matter sector to the nonlinear sigma model on a symmetric coset space. The duality is manifested with the help of a covariant formulation of the classical equations of motion that features a contact quartic scalar self-coupling. This is augmented with a set of constitutive relations that reflect the intrinsic or extrinsic geometry of the target space of the theory.

## 16. More on 8d non-supersymmetric branes and heterotic strings

**Authors:** Yuta Hamada, Arata Ishige, Yuichi Koga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15144v1)

**Summary:**

In light of the no global symmetry/cobordism conjecture in quantum gravity, our result also offer a classification of non-supersymmetric branes in 8d supersymmetric heterotic string theories. We determine the maximal gauge groups arising in $E_8$ heteroticstring theory on $T^2$. For each case, we present the corresponding massless spectrum. We directly study the toroidal compactification of 10d $E-8$heterotic string.

## 17. Quasinormal Modes from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations in Vector-Tensor   Gravity

**Authors:** Shogo Tomizuka, Hajime Kobayashi, Naritaka Oshita, Kazufumi Takahashi, Shinji Mukohyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15125v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric black hole background with a timelike vector field. We derive the quadratic Lagrangian written in terms of two master variables, corresponding to the tensor and vector gravitons. The ringdown gravitational waves may exhibit characteristic modulation that can in principle be a signature of vector-tensor gravity. We find that the quasinormal mode frequencies for both degrees of freedom are obtained from those in general relativity by simple scaling.

## 18. Imprints of Large-Scale Structures in the Anisotropies of the   Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background

**Authors:** Rafael Bravo, Walter Riquelme

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15084v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the cross-correlation between the anisotropies of the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) and the galaxy density contrast. We find that the signal under certain conditions could be distinguishable from noise. Our results imply that a cross-Correlation between GW anisotropic and LSS can indeed come from a stochastic background ofcosmological origin and could be used to distinguish it from an astrophysical one. In addition, by considering a CGWB sourced by scalar-induced gravitational waves, and the inclusion of a scale-dependent galaxy bias, we use theCrossCorrelation to forecast local primordial non-Gaussianity.

## 19. Non-Factorizing Interface in the Two-Dimensional Long-Range Ising Model

**Authors:** Dongsheng Ge, Yu Nakayama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15018v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter, we study a two-dimensional long-range Ising model at criticality with a line defect or an interface, which physically corresponds to changing the local temperature on it. We show that in the perturbative regime, it is not factorizing even in the infrared limit. An intuitive explanation of the non-factorization is that the model is equivalent to a local conformal field theory in higher dimensions. In this picture, the space is still connected through the "extra dimension" across the defect line.
