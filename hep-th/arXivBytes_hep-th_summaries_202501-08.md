## 0. Modular Features of Superstring Scattering Amplitudes: Generalised   Eisenstein Series and Theta Lifts

**Authors:** Daniele Dorigoni, Michael B. Green, Congkao Wen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03996v1)

**Summary:**

The coefficients of terms in the large-$N$ expansion of a certain integrated four-point correlator of superconformal primary operators are rational sums of real-analytic Eisenstein series. The latter are novel modular functions first encountered in the context of graviton amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory. Similar modular functions, known as two-loop modular graph functions, are also encountered in low-energy expansion of the integrand of genus-one closed superstring amplitudes. Through the theta lift representation, we demonstrate that elements belonging to these two families of non-holomorphic modular functions can be expressed as rational linear combinations of generalised Eisensteinseries.

## 1. Deep observations of the Type IIB flux landscape

**Authors:** Aman Chauhan, Michele Cicoli, Sven Krippendorf, Anshuman Maharana, Pellegrino Piantadosi, Andreas Schachner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03984v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03984v1)

**Summary:**

We present deep observations in targeted regions of the string landscape through a combination of analytic and dedicated numerical methods. We devise an algorithm designed for the systematic construction of Type IIB flux vacua in finite regions of moduli space. Our results highlight local deviations from statistical expectations, providing insights into vacuum densities, superpotential distributions, and moduli mass hierarchies. We find an example with $|W_0| = 5.547 \times 10^{-5}$ at large complex structure without light directions and the use of non-perturbative effects.

## 2. Quantum Scalar Field Dynamics On A Maximally Sliced Two-sided AdS Black   Hole Spacetime

**Authors:** Anurag Kaushal, Naveen S. Prabhakar, Spenta R. Wadia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03926v1)

**Summary:**

We study the semi-classical dynamics of a scalar field in the background of a black hole in an asymptotically AdS (AAdS) spacetime, in the framework of the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. We present the explicit solution for the smooth maximal slicing of the fully extended BTZ solution where the spatial slices cut across the horizons, do not include the past and future singularities, and for which the lapse remains non-zero at the bifurcate point. While many of our results are valid for AAdS$_{d+1}$ spacetimes, we mainly discuss the $d=2$ case of the static BTz solution.

## 3. Bekenstein Bound for Approximately Local Charged States

**Authors:** Stefan Hollands, Roberto Longo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03849v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the energy-entropy ratio inequality in quantum field theory (QFT) from localized states to a larger class of states. The states considered in this paper can be in a charged (non-vacuum) representation of the QFT or may be only approximately localized in the region under consideration. Our inequality is $S(\Psi |\!| \Omega) \le 2\pi R \, ( \Psi, H_\rho \ Psi ) + \log d(\rho) + \varepsilon$, where $S$ is the relative entropy.

## 4. Dynamic structure factor of Calogero-Sutherland fluids

**Authors:** Fedrico L. Bottesi, Guillermo R. Zemba

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03762v1)

**Summary:**

The effective extended conformal field theory that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model is considered. The dynamic structure factor of the chiral component in the repulsive regime is determined and compared with the corresponding one of the free bosonic theory. In either case, a sharp response function peaked at only one resonant frequency is found, and the physical implications of this outcome are addressed. This outcome provides further support to the equivalence between the first and second quantized treatments of the model.

## 5. Foliated Asymptotically Safe Gravity -- Lorentzian Signature   Fluctuations from the Wick Rotation

**Authors:** Frank Saueressig, Jian Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03752v1)

**Summary:**

Asymptotic Safety constitutes a promising mechanism for a consistent and predictive high-energy completion of the gravitational interactions. Most results on the interacting renormalization group fixed point underlying the construction are obtained for Euclidean signature spacetimes. We discuss the general conditions which guarantee the equivalence of the beta functions. These insights are illustrated based on the flow of the graviton two-point function within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. The UV- and IR-completions identified in the Euclideans case are robust when changing spacetime signature.

## 6. Quite Discrete for a fermion

**Authors:** Vasileios A. Letsios, Ben Pethybridge, Alan Rios Fukelman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03724v1)

**Summary:**

We study Discrete Series representations of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ with half-integer scale dimension $Delta$. We show that these UIRs are realised in the space of mode solutions of spinor fields. We propose a Euclidean procedure to deal with the zero-modes, define a two-point function with the right singularity structure, and analyse its late-time behaviour. We end this note by proposing two interacting theories containing the fermionic discrete series in their spectrum.

## 7. On Classifying HyperKÃ¤hler Kummer 8-Orbifolds

**Authors:** Daniel Andrew Baldwin, Bobby Samir Acharya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03692v1)

**Summary:**

HyperK\"ahler spaces play an important role in superstring/$M$-theory and gauge theories as well as in differential and algebraic geometry. In this paper we provide hundreds of new examples of compact hyperK \"ahler orbifolds of Kummer type $T^8/G$ We show that, out of all of these examples, the only orb ifolds whose singularities have a known holomorphic symplectic resolution lead to manifolds diffeomorphic to the two currently known examples. We also demonstrate that these methods can, when combined with theorems of Joyce, be extended to construct potentially new manifolds.

## 8. Splitting dynamics of quantized composite vortices in holographic   miscible binary superfluids

**Authors:** Yuping An, Li Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03561v1)

**Summary:**

The stability properties and splitting dynamics of multiply quantized vortices are the subject of interest in both theoretical and experimental investigations. In this paper, we show that the occurrence of dynamic instabilities and the instability strength are sensitive to the temperature. We uncover different dynamical behaviors compared to results from GPE that is valid in weak coupling limit and zero temperature. Our results highlight the important role of temperature and the distinction between dynamics of composite vortice in weakly interacting superfluids without dissipation and strongly interacting case with dissipation.

## 9. Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible   for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?

**Authors:** Chan-Gyung Park, Bharat Ratra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480v1)

**Summary:**

We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$)

## 10. Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations

**Authors:** Mohammad Ali Gorji, Misao Sasaki, Teruaki Suyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03444v1)

**Summary:**

We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations. We also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exactTransfer function reproduces known behaviors.
