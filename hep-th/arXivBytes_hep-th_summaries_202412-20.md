## 0. A Pathway to Decay and Fission of Orthosymplectic Quiver Theories

**Authors:** Craig Lawrie, Lorenzo Mansi, Marcus Sperling, Zhenghao Zhong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15202v1)

**Summary:**

We present an algorithm to extract the Coulomb branch Hasse diagram of orthosymplectic 3d quiver gauge theories. The algorithm systematically predicts all descendant theories arising from Coulomb Branch Higgsing. We validate our algorithm via the 3d mirror of 4d theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ of such type. We benchmark our method via Higgssing 6d D-type orbi-instanton theories, predicting novel patterns involving products of interacting fixed points.

## 1. A Central Charge for sub-AdS Holography

**Authors:** Abir Ghosh, Chethan Krishnan, Adinath Mahalingam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15201v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15201v1)

**Summary:**

We associate a central charge to sub-AdS scales of AdS x $X$ geometries. The AdS length is the length of the long string in a stack of $N$ $backreacted$ D-branes. Our proposal applies in general dimensions, connects with and refines previous ideas about sub-matrix deconfinement & long strings. Some of our arguments draw intuition from separating branes, and have natural connections to (heating up) the Coulomb branch of the gauge theory.

## 2. On the New Factorizations of Yang-Mills Amplitudes

**Authors:** Yong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15198v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15198v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we prove the new factorization pattern for tree-level Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes proposed in a companion paper. This pattern reveals a decomposition of amplitudes into a sum of gluings of lower-point amplitudes under specific kinematic constraints. This work not only conclusively validates the proposed factorization but also provides new insights into the geometric and algebraic organization of YM amplitudes within the Cachazo-He-Yuan framework.

## 3. From black hole interior to quantum complexity through operator rank

**Authors:** Alexey Milekhin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15183v1)

**Summary:**

It has been conjectured that the size of the black hole interior captures the quantum gate complexity of the underlying boundary evolution. In this short note we aim to provide a further microscopic evidence for this by directly relating the area of a certain codimension-two surface traversing the interior to the depth of the quantum circuit. Our arguments are based on establishing such relation rigorously at early times using the notion of operator Schmidt rank and then extrapolating it to later times by mapping bulk surfaces to cuts in the circuit representation.

## 4. Capturing the Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics of Black Holes in   Quantum Computers

**Authors:** Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Kwangmin Yu, Muhammad Asaduzzaman, Raza Sabbir Sufian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15180v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15180v1)

**Summary:**

The current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. We employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure theEntanglement entropy ofHawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. We establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entangled entropy of complex quantum systems.

## 5. Primordial Gravitational Wave Probes of Non-Standard Thermal Histories

**Authors:** Annet Konings, Mariia Marinichenko, Oleksii Mikulenko, Subodh P. Patil

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15144v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial gravitational waves propagate almost unimpeded from the moment they are generated to the present epoch. Given the paucity of probes of the early universe physics before nucleosynthesis, it is useful to classify how deviations from the standard thermal history can be constrained from observations of the late time stochastic background. We survey phenomenologically motivated scenarios of early matter domination, kination, and late time decaying particles as representative non-standard thermal histories. We elaborate on their late time Stochastic Background, and discuss constraints on different model scenarios.

## 6. Circle compactifications of Minkowski$_D$ solutions, flux vacua and   solitonic branes

**Authors:** Niall T. Macpherson, Paul Merrikin, Ricardo Stuardo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15102v1)

**Summary:**

G-structure techniques are used to construct broad classes of circle compactifications of Mink$_{D+1}$ solutions. Under a certain assumptions we show that the conditions that imply supersymmetry for Mink $_2$ imply those of the Mink Mink$_1$ solution. We apply our results to construct some simple Minkowski flux vacua. We then turn our attention to "solitonic branes" which are generalisations of the AdS soliton. This realises an off shell solution generating technique for supersymmetric solutions or a "supersymmetry generating" technique.

## 7. Monodromic transparency of axion domain walls

**Authors:** Simone Blasi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15085v1)

**Summary:**

The standard linear coupling to photons is generally insufficient to accurately describe the interaction of light with the defects. We take this into account in evaluating the friction experienced by axion domain walls moving in a thermal bath of photons, as well as in deriving the birefringent properties of the walls. This clarifies some results in the literature dealing with a special cancellation that takes place for the QCD axion with the electromagnetic and color anomaly as predicted by minimal Grand Unified Theories. It also explains the effects related to the breaking of the axion shift symmetry including the well-known mixing with meson states.

## 8. Islands, Double Holography, and the Entanglement Membrane

**Authors:** Hanzhi Jiang, Mike Blake, Anthony P. Thompson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15070v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as theEntanglement membrane. We show that the entangler dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglements membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi- classical gravity and a chaotic quantumMany-body system calculation of the Page curve.

## 9. Inflation in non-local hybrid metric-Palatini gravity

**Authors:** Flavio Bombacigno, Mariaveronica De Angelis, Carsten van de Bruck, William Giarè

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15064v1)

**Summary:**

The theory is based on a hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. We incorporate non-localities introduced via the inverse of the d'Alembert operators acting on the scalar curvature. We examine how the non-minimal kinetic couplings between the fields influence the number of e-folds and the field trajectories. To clarify the physical interpretation of our results, we draw analogies with benchmark single-field inflation scenarios that include spectator fields. The study was published in the journal of Theoretical Physics.

## 10. Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories

**Authors:** Baptiste Filoche, Stefan Hohenegger, Taro Kimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048v1)

**Summary:**

$A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle. A surface defect breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. We discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit.

## 11. Gravitational quasinormal modes in quadratic gravity

**Authors:** Georgios Antoniou, Leonardo Gualtieri, Paolo Pani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15037v1)

**Summary:**

We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massivespin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same.

## 12. Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays

**Authors:** Alison Warman, Fan Yang, Apoorv Tiwari, Hannes Pichler, Sakura Schafer-Nameki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024v1)

**Summary:**

Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. We propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry. We outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.

## 13. Field-dependent diffeomorphisms and the transformation of surface   charges between gauges

**Authors:** Luca Ciambelli, Marc Geiller

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14992v1)

**Summary:**

Weyl charge vanishes in the Bondi-Sachs gauge but not in the Fefferman-Graham gauge. This indicates that the gauge-dependent Weyl charge differs fundamentally from charges like mass and angular momentum. This interpretation is reinforced by two key observations: the Weyl conformal factor does not satisfy any flux-balance law, and the associated charge arises from a corner term in the symplectic structure. These properties justify assigning the Wey charge a kinematical status.

## 14. The Line operators in the G2HDM model

**Authors:** Rui Yang, Jiaming Guo, Linghai Li, Tzu-Chiang Yuan, Xun Xue

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14949v1)

**Summary:**

We describe the global structure of a particle model with dark matter called G2HDM. We also describe how the electric and magnetic charges depend on the gauge group of such model. Finally, we describe the minimal charges that arise after electroweak symmetry breaking for any choice of $G$ and $Gamma$ We conclude with an ambiguity that it may actually be $G= \tilde{G} / {\Gamma} \;$, where $G' is a subgroup of its center.

## 15. Linking disks, spinning vortices and exponential networks of   augmentation curves

**Authors:** Kunal Gupta, Pietro Longhi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14901v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14901v1)

**Summary:**

Quivers are obtained by studying M2 branes wrapping holomorphic disks with Lagrangian boundary conditions on an M5 brane. They are identified with a distinguished sector of BPS kinky vortices in the 3d-3d dual QFT. We propose a mirror derivation of the quiver description of open topological strings known as the knots-quivers correspondence. This is based on enumerative invariants of augmentation curves encoded by exponential networks. It suggests that holomorphic disk with boundary conditions are mirror to calibrated 1-chains on the associated augmentation curve, whose intersections encode the linking of boundaries.

## 16. Dilaton Weyl multiplets for $N = 3$ conformal supergravity in four   dimensions

**Authors:** Soumya Adhikari, Aravind Aikot, Madhu Mishra, Bindusar Sahoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14874v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $N = 3$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. The R-symmetry of the multiplet is $SU(2) \times U(1) $ We couple an on-shell vector multiplet to the standard Weyl. We gauge fix one of the two $U( 1)$ symmetries and rewrite the result for the dilaton multiplet with $SU (2)    $ R-Symmetry. We use the field equations of the vectors to replace some of the components of the auxiliary fields.

## 17. Diagrammatic Derivation of Hidden Zeros and Exact Factorisation of Pion   Scattering Amplitudes

**Authors:** Yang Li, Tianzhi Wang, Tomáš Brauner, Diederik Roest

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14858v1)

**Summary:**

Pion scattering amplitudes were recently found to vanish on specific kinematic loci. We propose a diagrammatic representation of pion amplitudes that makes their vanishing on the loci manifest diagram by diagram. We provide evidence that there is a closed-form expression that generalises the near-zero factorisation in an exact manner. Our approach crucially relies on a novel formulation of the effective field theory of pions, in which tree-level scattering Amplitudes are extracted from classical field equations for a set of currents and emergent composite gauge fields.

## 18. $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal gravitino in harmonic superspace

**Authors:** Evgeny Ivanov, Nikita Zaigraev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14822v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitino supermultiplet is described by unconstrained analytic prepotentials. We present the harmonic superspace formulation of the Gravitino multiplet. We speculate on the possible origin of the additional coordinates, including their relationship with supertwistors. We observe that, at cost of introducing new auxiliary coordinates, the gravitinos acquire a nice geometric interpretation as extra veilbeins of the covariant harmonic derivative of the Wess-Zumino gauge. We construct the covarianant and invariant superfield actions and sketch their component contents.

## 19. Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model

**Authors:** Marta Bucca, Márk Mezei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14799v1)

**Summary:**

The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it.

## 20. Holographic subregion complexity in a moving strongly coupled plasma

**Authors:** Mohammad Mahdi Daryaei Goki, Mohammad Ali-Akbari, Mahsa Lezgi, Vahid Esrafilian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14755v1)

**Summary:**

We study holographic subregion complexity in a moving strongly coupled plasma in dimensions d = 2, 3, 4. The proposal we employ is the one that identifies the complexity of a mixed state by the volume of codimensional-one hypersurface enclosed by Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi surface. Using the finite difference method, the numerical calculations reveal that temperature, velocity, and subregion length all have an increasing effect on holographicsubregion complexity. For arbitrary values of temperature and sub Region length, as velocity approaches its relativistic upper limit, holographicSubregion complexity exhibits a divergence.

## 21. New Modes for Vector Bosons in the Static Patch

**Authors:** Adel A. Rahman, Leonard Susskind

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14749v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a massive vector Boson in a static patch of $D$-dimensional de Sitter space (dS$_D$). We argue that this field is controlled by an effective physical (squared) mass. In $D = 3$ spacetime dimensions, the $s$-wave sector of our theory remarkably simplifies. We conjecture that the theory remains well-defined in the naively tachyonic Lagrangian mass range of $-2(D-1) < 0.

## 22. Quantum aspects of heterotic $G_2$ systems

**Authors:** Xenia de la Ossa, Magdalena Larfors, Matthew Magill, Eirik E. Svanes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14715v1)

**Summary:**

 Compactifications of the heterotic string give rise to three-dimensional supergravity theories that admit Minkowski and AdS ground states. Such vacua correspond to critical loci of a real superpotential $W$. We perform a perturbative study around a supersymmetric vacuum of the theory. We determine infinitesimal moduli and their obstructions in terms of related cohomology groups. Finally, by interpreting $W$ as an action, we compute the one-loop partition function of the $G_2$ system.

## 23. On the geometry of Lagrangian one-forms

**Authors:** Vincent Caudrelier, Derek Harland

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14700v1)

**Summary:**

Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation. We also show that our new framework easily extends to non-commuting flows corresponding to nonabelian Lie groups. Thus Hamiltonian Lie group actions can be derived from a Variational principle.

## 24. Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes

**Authors:** Goncalo Araujo-Regado, Philipp A. Hoehn, Francesco Sartini, Bilyana Tomova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548v1)

**Summary:**

Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Here, we show that there is an arguably more interesting relationship. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical reference frames for dressing subregion variables. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We anticipate that core insights extend to Yang-Mills theory andgravity.

## 25. Transformer models are gauge invariant: A mathematical connection   between AI and particle physics

**Authors:** Leo van Nierop

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14543v1)

**Summary:**

In particle physics, the fundamental forces are subject to symmetries called gauge invariance. It is a redundancy in the mathematical description of any physical system. In this article I will demonstrate that the transformer architecture exhibits the same properties. I show that the default representation of transformers has partially, but not fully removed the gauge invariance from the system. I also show that it is possible to use a different architecture to achieve the same result in a different way.

## 26. Fractionalization of flux tubes in 3d and screening by emergent electric   charges in 2d

**Authors:** Mendel Nguyen, Mithat Ünsal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14532v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a class of 3d theories with a magnetic symmetry in which confinement is generated by charge $n$ clusters of monopoles. Such theories naturally arise in quantum antiferromagnets in 2+1, QCD-like theories on $U(1)$ lattice theory with restricted monopole sums. We show that large Wilson loops are completely/partially screened for even/odd $n$, even when the compactification scale is much larger than the Debye length. We end with some remarks on screening vs. confinement.

## 27. Deformations of AdS and exact sequences

**Authors:** Andrei Mikhailov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14455v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14455v1)

**Summary:**

We give some examples of Ext groups relevant to computations in the AdS supergravity, using the pure spinor formalism. Our main examples are deformations of $AdS_5\times S^5$ transforming in finite-dimensional representations of the superconformal algebra. In the study of correlation functions, it is important to compute the resolution of BRST-exact products of vertex operators. The resolution is typically non-covariant, because of cohomological obstacles.

## 28. Anomalous Continuous Translations

**Authors:** Nathan Seiberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14434v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories. The Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry is broken to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.
