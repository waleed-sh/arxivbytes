## 0. Near-SUSY to Non-SUSY Crossover

**Authors:** Dan Kondo, Hitoshi Murayama, Bea Noether

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18138v1)

**Summary:**

Gauge theories can be solved exactly slightly away from the supersymmetric (SUSY) limit softly broken by anomaly mediation. The evidence includes the behavior of quark bi-linear condensate and gluon condensates, light hadron spectra, and consistency with the large $N_c$ limit. In addition, we present new predictions when $N-f/N-c \gtrsim O(1)$ is used to solve the SUSY limit.

## 1. Comment on "Geometry of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model"

**Authors:** Dragan Prekrat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18123v1)

**Summary:**

We clarify a key point in the geometric reinterpretation of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar (GW) model. We show that the analysis in Section 6 was applied not to the actual $\Omega$-term in the GW action. Once corrected, the main conclusion -- relating the harmonic potential term to background curvature -- remains valid, though the parameter identification must be revised. This also resolves a discrepancy concerning the emergence of certain vacuum solutions in the self-dual limit of the model.

## 2. Higher-order topological phases protected by non-invertible and   subsystem symmetries

**Authors:** Aswin Parayil Mana, Yabo Li, Hiroki Sukeno, Tzu-Chieh Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18119v1)

**Summary:**

Higher-order topological phases with invertible symmetries have been extensively studied in recent years. In this work, we extend the framework of higher-order symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases to include non-invertible symmetry. We construct a concrete model of a second-order SPT phase in $2+1$ dimensions that hosts symmetry- protected corner modes protected by a non- invertable symmetry. This construction is then generalized to a $d^{th}$- order SPTPhase in $d+1 $ dimensions, featuring similarly protected corner mode.

## 3. Single-valued representation of unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive   deep inelastic scattering at next-to-next-to-leading order

**Authors:** Juliane Haug, Fabian Wunder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18109v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18109v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the recently published analytic results for unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in QCD. These expressions for the hard scattering coefficients contain case distinctions in the kinematic $(x,z)$ plane splitting the analytic result in four regions. By re-expressing the coefficient functions in terms of single-valued polylogarithms we remove these case distinctions. This reduces the length of the overall expressions by 30% to 60%.

## 4. The Noether formalism for constructing conserved quantities in   teleparallel equivalents of general relativity

**Authors:** E. D. Emtsova, A. N. Petrov, A. V. Toporensky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18084v1)

**Summary:**

 conserved currents, superpotentials, and charges are constructed. These are shown to be covariant under coordinate transformations and local Lorentz rotations in TEGR, while in STEGR they are not. The teleparallel (flat) connections in both theories are defined using the "turning off gravity" principle. Uniting such defined flat connections with tetrad in T EGR and metric in STegR a new fruitful in applications notion "gauge" is introduced.

## 5. High-energy factorization via eigenfunctions of the   next-to-leading-order BFKL kernel

**Authors:** Ada Polizzi, Michael Fucilla, Alessandro Papa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18074v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18074v1)

**Summary:**

We present a general formula for the amplitude of forward exclusive hadronic processes in the semihard regime of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) The formula is based on the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) kernel, as constructed by Chirilli and Kovchegov. We discuss some formal subtleties in the check of compatibility with the similar formula. Finally, in the specific case of the electroproduction of two light vector mesons we consider the numerical stability of the amplitude when one or the other set of eigenfunctions is adopted.

## 6. Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers

**Authors:** Sergio Luigi Cacciatori, Fabrizio Canfora, Evangelo Delgado, Federica Muscolino, Luigi Rosa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18007v1)

**Summary:**

 magnetized Baryonic layers have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM) Using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities of these layers. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system.

## 7. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Graviweak Theory

**Authors:** Stephon Alexander, Bruno Alexandre, João Magueijo, Max Pezzelle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17935v1)

**Summary:**

Graviweak theory seeks to unify gravity (specifically in its self-dual formulation) with the weak interaction, preying on their parallel chiral $SU(2)$ structures. In this paper we further this idea by folding it with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We do this first with a standard Higgs field and potential, starting with a unifying parity-invariant theory. By rewriting the theory in the two-spin framework we are then prompted to discuss generalizations, within the generic approach known as MacDowell-Mansouri theories.

## 8. On the Asymptotic Nature of Cosmological Effective Theories

**Authors:** Carlos Duaso Pueyo, Harry Goodhew, Ciaran McCulloch, Enrico Pajer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17820v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17820v1)

**Summary:**

Much of our intuition about Effective Field Theories (EFTs) stems from their formulation in flat spacetime. EFTs have become indispensable tools in cosmology, where time-dependent backgrounds are the norm. We demonstrate that meaningful EFT predictions can still be extracted via appropriate resummation techniques, performed in both Fourier and Mellin-momentum space. We analyze simple toy models involving a massless or conformally coupled scalar field interacting with a heavy scalar with zero or infinite sound speed.

## 9. Primordial black holes through preheating instabilities in   $α$-attractor models

**Authors:** Daniel del-Corral, Paolo Gondolo, K. Sravan Kumar, João Marto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17790v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the context of inflationary models. During this phase, self-resonance instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a quadratic form. We calculate the PBH mass fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms. Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance during preheating.

## 10. Does Unruh effect necessarily imply entanglement?

**Authors:** Vaibhav Wasnik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17744v1)

**Summary:**

We show that despite the fact that an accelerating observer would note the Minkowski vacuum to be thermal, an inconsistency is implied writing the Minksowski vacuum as an entangled state between Rindler wedges. We highlight the reason behind the inconsistency in the derivation as an issue with expanding the relevant fields in a complete set of frequency modes. We next highlight issues in this textbook derivation by first noting the blowing up of Bogoluibov coefficients at $k=0$, followed by showing that that two point correlation function evaluations are inconsistent.

## 11. Boundary Effects on Anyon Dynamics in Chern-Simons Theory

**Authors:** Tzu-Miao Chou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17617v1)

**Summary:**

This work investigates the boundary and defect effects on the modular data in SU$(N)_k$ Chern-Simons theories. Different boundary conditions and symmetry defects modify the fusion rules and braiding statistics of anyons. The approach includes the computation of modular matrix deformations in the presence of junctions between different boundary conditions. This work lays the groundwork for further studies of boundary and defects effects in topological quantum field theories and their connections to topological Quantum computation and holography.

## 12. Anyonic Excitations in Warped and Curved AdS Backgrounds

**Authors:** Tzu-Miao Chou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17611v1)

**Summary:**

This work studies anyonic excitations in warped and curved AdS$_3$ backgrounds via Chern-Simons theory. By incorporating geometric deformations such as conical defects, it is shown that curvature modifies the fusion and braiding properties through corrections to modular data. Analytical models and numerical simulations reveal how these deformations affect the topological structure and influence holographic duals, especially in relation to entanglement and quantum error correction. The study was published in the journal Applied Physics.

## 13. Decoherence by black holes via holography

**Authors:** Shoichi Kawamoto, Da-Shin Lee, Chen-Pin Yeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17450v1)

**Summary:**

In this note, we reexamine decoherence effects in quantum field theories with gravity duals. The interference experiment takes place on the boundary, where a superposition of two spatially separated quantum states of a mirror is maintained for a finite time. We find that the interaction with a quantum field at finite temperature, arising from the presence of a Lifshitz black hole, leads to a constantDecoherence rate. In contrast, for the zero-temperature case corresponding to pure Lifshitzer spacetime, the decoherent rate vanishes in the large-time limit.
