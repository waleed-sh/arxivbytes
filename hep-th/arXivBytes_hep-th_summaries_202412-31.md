## 0. Branes Screening Quarks and Defect Operators

**Authors:** Andreas Karch, Marcos Riojas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21204v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21204v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize a well-known computation showing Wilson lines exhibit Coulomb scaling laws in AdS/CFT at zero temperature. The area difference between a surface that returns to the boundary, and one that plunges into the bulk, determines the potential between two quarks. We find (generalized) Coulomb law scaling in subregion size $Gamma$ is recovered only above the critical angle for the brane. The potential between the two quark (or defect operators) vanishes precisely when the surface connecting them ceases to exist.

## 1. Topological Responses of the Standard Model Gauge Group

**Authors:** Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang, Yi-Zhuang You

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21196v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21196v1)

**Summary:**

We enumerate lower-dimensional iTFT / SPTs in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the 4d SPTs are interesting gapped phases attachable to the SM, those integer classes of SPTs (either the torsion or the free cobordism class) are not universal and are difficult to detect. However, fractional SPTs can be detected by a topological response similar to the Hall conductance under an appropriate symmetry twist background field.

## 2. Cut-Out Wedges in $H_{3}$ and the Borel-Resurgent Chern-Simons Matrix   Integrals

**Authors:** Tuo Jia, Zhaojie Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21190v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we present a systematic study of the Chern--Simons theory with gauge group. The theory is restricted to a wedge-identified manifold in the hyperbolic upper-half-space. We show that, despite the apparent simplicity of the reduced action, the wedge geometry yields a rich interplay of perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena. This work presents an explicit example of how a finite-dimensional matrix integral in its expansions is physically meaningful through Borel resummation.

## 3. The Many Colours of Amplitudes

**Authors:** Jacob L. Bourjaily, Michael Plesser, Cristian Vergu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21189v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21189v1)

**Summary:**

We study the colour-dependence of scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory with arbitrary (but fixed) gauge group and various representations of charged matter. It is well known that the number of independent colour-structure tensors grows factorially with multiplicity. We review how this counting arises in representation theory and survey its implications for a wide variety of specific gauge groups with various representations. We uncover several surprising structures along the way, as well as a number of new insights into the theory.

## 4. Holographic observers for time-band algebras

**Authors:** Kristan Jensen, Suvrat Raju, Antony J. Speranza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21185v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21185v1)

**Summary:**

We study the algebra of observables in a time band on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space in a theory of quantum gravity. Our construction requires a choice of dressing that determines how elements of the algebra transform under the Hamiltonian. At leading order in gravitational perturbation theory, our construction reduces to the modular crossed-product described previously in the literature. We also prove a theorem showing that this is the only crossed product of a type III$_1$ algebra resulting in an algebra with a trace.

## 5. Quantum algorithms for the simulation of QCD processes in the   perturbative regime

**Authors:** Herschel A. Chawdhry, Mathieu Pellen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21177v1)

**Summary:**

Theoretical predictions for high-energy collision processes at particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), rely on calculations in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) We explore the possibility of using quantum computers to simulate QCD processes. In particular, as a first step towards that goal, we present quantum circuits to simulate the colour part ofperturbative QCD. The circuits are validated by implementing them on a simulated quantum computer and verifying the colour factors for several example Feynman diagrams.

## 6. Classical $J\bar T$ symmetries -- three ways -- and a precision   holography check

**Authors:** Silvia Georgescu, Monica Guica

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21176v1)

**Summary:**

The $J\bar T$ deformation is a fully tractable irrelevant deformation of two-dimensional CFTs, which yields a UV-complete QFT. Such QFTs are interesting, in particular, as toy models for the holographic dual to (near-extremal black holes. Despite its non-locality, the deformed theory has been shown to posess a (Virasoro-Kac-Moody)$^2$ symmetry algebra, whose action on the non-local side is non-standard.

## 7. Causality and Stability from Acoustic Geometry

**Authors:** Ignacy Sawicki, Georg Trenkler, Alexander Vikman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21169v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21169v1)

**Summary:**

Scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions form backgrounds which spontaneously break Lorentz invariance. We investigate the dynamics of free scalar perturbations on general anisotropic backgrounds. We demonstrate that the phonons move on null geodesics of an acoustic spacetime described by its own metric and own connection featuring nonmetricity with respect to the usual spacetime metric. We discuss the phonon properties that moving observers, inequivalent owing to the breaking of LorentZ invariance, would measure.

## 8. Quantum uncertainty in the area of a black hole

**Authors:** Maulik Parikh, Jude Pereira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21160v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum fluctuations of the spacetime metric induce an uncertainty in the horizon area of a black hole. For macroscopic black holes, the quantum uncertainty is therefore enormous in Planck units. We find that the standard deviation of the horizonarea scales as the product of the Schwarzschild radius and the Planck length. We derive the variance in the area of the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole from the renormalized graviton propagator. We then use this to work in linearized quantum gravity.

## 9. Particle-Soliton Degeneracy in 2D Quantum Chromodynamics

**Authors:** Clay Cordova, Diego García-Sepúlveda, Nicholas Holfester

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21153v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions admits a finite non-invertible symmetry described mathematically by a fusion category. This symmetry is spontaneously broken at long distances, leading to distinct vacua. We use anyon condensation and the representation theory of fusion categories to obtain exact results about this spectrum. The resulting degeneracies are encoded in quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are excited states. It is hoped that this article will shed some light on the theory of quantum chromodynamics.

## 10. From Painlevé equations to ${\cal N}=2$ susy gauge theories:   prolegomena

**Authors:** Davide Fioravanti, Marco Rossi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21148v1)

**Summary:**

We study the linear problems in $z,t$ (time) associated to the Painlev\'e III$_3$ and III#3$ equations. We conjecture that this link holds for any Painlev’s equation relating each of them to a different matter theory. An explicit expression for the dual gauge period (and then prepotential) is also found. As a by-product, a new solution to the connexion problem is illustrated. The equations appear as Nekrasov-Shatashvili quantisations/deformations of Seiberg-Witten differentials for $SU(2)$

## 11. Topological dark energy from black-hole formations and mergers through   the gravity-thermodynamics approach

**Authors:** Stylianos A. Tsilioukas, Nicholas Petropoulos, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach in the case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector of topological origin. We estimate the black-hole formation and merger rates starting from the observed star formation rate per redshift. Finally, we study the effect of the other model parameters, showing that for the whole allowed observationally estimated ranges, the topological dark-energy equation-of-state parameter remains within its observational bounds.

## 12. Vertex algebras, topological defects, and Moonshine

**Authors:** Roberto Volpato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21141v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21141v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss topological defect lines in holomorphic vertices and superalgebras. We consider duality defects in $V^\natural$ for all non-anomalous Fricke elements of the Monster group. We argue that, under some mild assumptions, every such defect is associated with a map form the Leech lattice to itself. Finally, we speculate about possible generalization of the Moonshine conjectures that include topological defect lines. We describe some general properties of the category of defect lines preserving the $N=1$ superVirasoro algebra.

## 13. Gravitational EFT for dissipative open systems

**Authors:** Pak Hang Chris Lau, Kanji Nishii, Toshifumi Noumi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21136v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity. Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics of the dissipative system of interest.

## 14. Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture

**Authors:** Li Gan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21128v1)

**Summary:**

We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$ This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian. We propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory. The conjecture is that square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walked are associated with local $mathcal{B}_3$

## 15. A polynomial affine model of gravity: after ten years

**Authors:** Oscar Castillo-Felisola, Bastian Grez, Manuel Morocho-López, Jose Perdiguero, Aureliano Skirzewski, Jefferson Vaca, Nicolas Zambra-Gómez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21122v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21122v1)

**Summary:**

The polynomial affine model of gravity was proposed as an alternative to metric and metric-affine gravitational models. It contains all possible combinations of the fields compatible with the covariance under diffeomorphisms. Here, we present a review of the advances in the analysis of the model after ten years of its proposal. We sketch the guideline of our future perspectives for the future of the field of gravitational theory and the theory of gravity in general. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.

## 16. All toric Kahler surfaces with twistor 2-forms

**Authors:** Sergei G. Ovchinnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21114v1)

**Summary:**

We complete the classification of all smooth 4-dimensional Kahler geometries admitting a twistor (conformal Killing-Yano) 2-form invariant under a 2-torus action. We establish that there are six geometrically distinct families, and we provide them in a simple form amenable to calculations and compute their curvature. We also find that for toric geometry the square norm of the twistor 2- form is quadratic in moment maps and we are led to conjecture that this holds when less symmetry is present.

## 17. Ordinary limits of the hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities

**Authors:** Mustafa Mullahasanoglu, Ali Mert T. Yetkin, Reyhan Yumusak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21108v1)

**Summary:**

The computation of the partition function of supersymmetric gauge theories on compact manifolds can be reduced to matrix integrals. We derive new ordinary hypergeometric identities from the reduction of certain hyperbolichypergeometric integral identities obtained via supers asymmetric infrared dualities. We also develop new complicated identities for this type of special function.

## 18. Coupled minimal models revisited II: Constraints from permutation   symmetry

**Authors:** António Antunes, Connor Behan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21107v1)

**Summary:**

Coupling $N$ large rank $m$ minimal models and flowing to IR fixed points is a systematic way to build new classes of compact unitary 2d CFTs. These are likely to be irrational, and potentially have a positive Virasoro twist gap above the vaccuum. We establish that, for spins less than 10, additional currents transforming in non-trivial irreducible representations of the permutation symmetry $S_N$ are not conserved at the IR fixed point.

## 19. The (in)stability of quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black   hole in the hyperboloidal framework

**Authors:** Li-Ming Cao, Liang-Bi Wu, Yu-Sen Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. We also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of thehyperboloidal approach.

## 20. Higher-Dimensional Black Holes and Effective Field Theory

**Authors:** Daniel Glazer, Austin Joyce, Maria J. Rodriguez, Luca Santoni, Adam R. Solomon, Luis Fernando Temoche

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21090v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21090v1)

**Summary:**

We study the scalar tidal responses of spinning higher-dimensional black holes. After constructing the effective field theory of a spinning point particle in general dimension, we apply this theory to match the responses of a variety of black hole solutions. We find that in the most generic case, the static responses of higher- dimensional spinning black holes do not vanish, but for special cases we find a pattern of zeroes in the responses, similar to other known examples. Further, we observe various interesting relations between the responses.

## 21. Inflation after Curvature Bounce

**Authors:** Rinat Kagirov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21087v1)

**Summary:**

We present a stable cosmological model of a closed universe in the presence of a conventional scalar field. The stability of the model and absence of singularity is ensured by spatial curvature without the need for additional peculiar matter. We reconstruct the Lagrangian and numerically compute observational predictions, including the number of e-folds, the spectral index $n_s$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We present several sets of parameters that satisfy the current observational data.

## 22. 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Mirror Symmetry, TQFTs, and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching

**Authors:** Mahesh K. N. Balasubramanian, Anindya Banerjee, Matthew Buican, Zhihao Duan, Andrea E. V. Ferrari, Hongliang Jiang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21066v1)

**Summary:**

Any local unitary field theory (SCFT) has a corresponding "universal" relevant deformation that takes it to a gapped phase. We argue that the universal deformations take these QFTs to Abelian fractional quantum Hall states in the infrared (IR) We explain how to match 't Hooft anomalies between the non-topological ultraviolet theories and the IR topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) Along the way, we give a proof that 3d $U(1)$ mirror symmetry of our Abelian gauge theories descends to a duality of these TQ FTs.

## 23. Timelike and gravitational anomalous entanglement from the inner horizon

**Authors:** Qiang Wen, Mingshuai Xu, Haocheng Zhong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21058v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21058v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, the boundary causal development and the entanglement wedge of any boundary spacelike interval can be mapped to a Rindler. While the outer horizon of the Rindlers is mapped to the RT surface, we also identify the pre-image of the inner horizon in the original AdS $_3$, which we call the inner RT surface. We also identify a timelike geodesic at boundary of the extended entanglements wedge, which represents the imaginary part of the HTEE.

## 24. Cosmological Signatures of Neutrino Seesaw

**Authors:** Chengcheng Han, Hong-Jian He, Linghao Song, Jingtao You

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21045v1)

**Summary:**

The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos. This can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this work, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrini seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right- handed neutrines. We demonstrate that this modulation produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures, which can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys.

## 25. The 3BF theory as a TQFT

**Authors:** Tijana Radenkovic, Marko Vojinovic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032v1)

**Summary:**

We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. This state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) We provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQ FT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.

## 26. NNLOCAL: completely local subtractions for color-singlet production in   hadron collisions

**Authors:** V. Del Duca, C. Duhr, L. Fekésházy, F. Guadagni, P. Mukherjee, G. Somogyi, F. Tramontano, S. Van Thurenhout

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21028v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21028v1)

**Summary:**

NNLOCAL is a proof-of-concept parton-level Monte Carlo program. It extends CoLoRFulNNLO to the case of color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We validate our procedure by computing the fully differential cross section for the production of a Higgs boson at the LHC in an effective field theory with gluons only. Our code provides the first public implementation of a completely local analytic subtraction scheme at next-to-next-to leading order accuracy.

## 27. The Cut Equation

**Authors:** Nima Arkani-Hamed, Hadleigh Frost, Giulio Salvatori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21027v1)

**Summary:**

Scattering amplitudes for colored theories have recently been formulated in a new way, in terms of curves on surfaces. In this note we describe a canonical set of functions we call surface functions, associated to all orders in the topological expansion. Surface functions are generating functions for all inequivalent triangulations of the surface. They generalize matrix model correlators, and in the planar limit, coincide with field theoretic loop integrands. We show that surface functions satisfy a universal recursion relation, the cut equation, that can be solved without introducing spurious poles.

## 28. Oscillator Calculus on Coadjoint Orbits and Index Theorems

**Authors:** Dmitri Bykov, Viacheslav Krivorol, Andrew Kuzovchikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21024v1)

**Summary:**

We consider quantum mechanical systems of spin chain type, with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We prove that they are natural truncations of 1D sigma models. The problem of finding the exact spectra of generalized Laplace operators on such orbits is shown to be equivalent to the diagonalization ofspin chain Hamiltonians. We compute the Witten indices of these finite- dimensional models showing that they reproduce the Dolbeault and de Rham indices of the target space. We conclude that these models are equivalent to 1D spin chain models.

## 29. Holography dual of accelerating and rotating black hole in Nariai limit

**Authors:** Shu Luo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21013v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21013v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole. We define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties. We conclude by discussing some of the properties of the rotating C-metric model of the black hole in Nariai limit, which is related to Kerr-CFT correspondence.

These proceedings discuss some of the highlights of recent research in Formal Theory. The topics covered range from recent progress in scatter amplitudes to quantum gravity. The proceedings are open to the public and can be attended by anyone. For more information, visit the official website of the F Theory Society, or visit the FTS website.

## 31. New Black Hole Solutions of Second and First Order Formulations of   Nonlinear Electrodynamics

**Authors:** Yosef Verbin, Beyhan Pulice, Ali Övgün, Hyat Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989v1)

**Summary:**

In this first order formalism the field strength and the gauge potential are treated as independent. Several new spherically-symmetric objects are constructed analytically and their main properties are studied. The solutions are obtained in flat spacetime ignoring gravity. Among the self-gravitating solutions we find new black holes and study their main characteristics. Some of the solutions can regularize the total energy of a point charge although their black hole counterparts are not regular. We consider within this formalism alternative and generalized non-linear Lagrangian densities.

## 32. On Analytical Solutions in Witten's Cubic Open String Field Theory

**Authors:** Ilmar Gahramanov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20981v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20981v1)

**Summary:**

This short review is based on the lecture given by the author at the Feza Gursey Physics Days School 2024. Here we briefly review analytic solutions (in particular, the Erler-Schnabl solution) of open cubic string field theory for the tachyon vacuum. We also briefly discuss some of the issues raised in the lecture, such as how to deal with the vacuum in the theory of string fields. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the results for our understanding of string theory.

## 33. Four loop renormalization of QCD in the Curci-Ferrari gauge

**Authors:** J. A. Gracey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20950v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20950v1)

**Summary:**

We renormalize Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) when gauge fixed in the nonlinear Curci-Ferrari gauge to four loops in the modified minimal subtraction (MSbar) scheme. We reproduce the four loop QCD MSbar beta-function from the Slavnov-Taylor identity for this gauge which relates the coupling constant renormalization to the gluon, Faddeev-Popov ghost and gauge parameter anomalous dimensions. This is carried out for a nonzero gauge parameter, without having to evaluate a vertices function.

## 34. Entangling gates from cabling of knots

**Authors:** Sergey Mironov, Andrey Morozov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20931v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20931v1)

**Summary:**

Two qubits are as usual a more difficult and complex story of different attempts with varying approaches, problems and effectiveness. In this paper we discuss how to construct an efficient realization of a two qubit gate in topological quantum computer, by using principle of cabling from the knot theory. This allows to construct a braiding of cables dependent on the parameters of the theory where there is a low probability of moving out of computational space (high fidelity of operation) We also present some examples of these operations for different parameters.

## 35. Spiralling branes, affine qq-characters and elliptic integrable systems

**Authors:** Yegor Zenkevich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20926v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the spiralling branes technique introduced in arXiv:2312.16990 to many-body integrable systems. We give a new R-matrix description of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider (RS) Hamiltonians and eigenfunctions using the intertwiners of quantum toroidal algebra. We then consider elliptic deformations of the RS system, elucidate how Shiraishi functions appear naturally in the process and relate them to certain special infinite system of intertwiners.

## 36. Searches for Power-Law Warped Extra Dimensions

**Authors:** Sang Hui Im, Krzysztof Jodłowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20913v1)

**Summary:**

Extra dimensions with a bulk dilaton field can be power-law warped, unlike the exponential warping in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We show that this mildly warped extra dimension can address the hierarchy problem with a novel Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum. We investigate the prospects of searching for signatures of such KK modes at current and future colliders, such as the LHC, CLIC, and FCC-ee using visible decays of KK gravitons.

## 37. Parametrized topological phases in 1d and T-duality

**Authors:** Roman Geiko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20905v1)

**Summary:**

There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes.

## 38. Superradiance in acoustic black hole

**Authors:** Chengye Yu, Xiaolin Zhang, Sobhan Kazempour, Sichun Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20890v1)

**Summary:**

Superradiance can occur in acoustic black holes when the general superradiance condition is met. Amplification effect is significantly weaker in black holes than in regular cylinders, due to the absorption in such structure. Superradiance in cylinders has recently been observed experimentally using acoustic waves to shed light on the understanding of the superradiant phenomenon in black hole. In this paper, for the first time, we study superradiances inoustic black holes through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation using COMSOL multiphysics.

## 39. Quantum flux operators in the fermionic theory and their supersymmetric   extension

**Authors:** Si-Mao Guo, Wen-Bin Liu, Jiang Long

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20829v1)

**Summary:**

We construct quantum flux operators with respect to the Poincar\'e symmetry in the massless Dirac theory at future null infinity. An anomalous helicity flux operator emerges from the commutator of the superrotation generators. We also find its relation to the non-closure of the Lie transport of the spinor field around a loop. We discuss various algebras formed by these operators and constrain the test functions by the requirement of eliminating non-local terms and satisfying the Jacobi identities. Furthermore, we explore their supersymmetric extension in the Wess-Zumino model.

## 40. The Domain Wall Soliton's Tension

**Authors:** Jarah Evslin, Hui Liu, Baiyang Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20814v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the one-loop tension of the domain wall soliton in the double-well model. In this case, unlike lower-dimensional cases, even after normal ordering there are ultraviolet divergences that require both mass and also coupling constant renormalization. We renormalized the coupling so that the three-point interaction in the effective potential is given by its tree level value at zero external momenta. After an additional 25 year interval, we have obtained a one- loop tension correction of $0.0410959m^3$ in 3+1d.

## 41. The Casimir Effect in (3+1)-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory at   finite temperature: the unexpected universality of quarkiton and glueton   boundary states

**Authors:** Maxim N. Chernodub, Vladimir A. Goy, Alexander V. Molochkov, Konstantin R. Pak, Alexey S. Tanashkin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20794v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20794v1)

**Summary:**

In our earlier work on the Casimir effect in (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we identified two novel nonperturbative states arising in QCD with boundaries. In this study, we extend our analysis to finite temperatures near the deconfinement phase transition. We observe a linear potential between a color-neutral chromometallic mirror and a heavy test quark. Our result suggests that the quarkiton state can have a physical relevance since mirrors for photons and gluons can be realized in field theories as domain-wall solutions.

## 42. Bulk thimbles dual to trace relations

**Authors:** Ji Hoon Lee, Douglas Stanford

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20769v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20769v1)

**Summary:**

The maximal giant graviton represents an upper bound on the $R$ charge that can be carried by certain bulk states. We find that the maximal giant is an unstable saddle point and that its Lefschetz thimble corresponds to the quantization of an imaginary phase space. We study a model for a path integral that would connect together components of the bulk half-BPS field space with different numbers of giants. The states resulting from the quantification of this phase space contribute negatively to the partition function and can be regarded as bulk duals of trace relations.

## 43. Emergence, Formation and Dynamics of Hot QCD Matter

**Authors:** Bruno Sebastian Scheihing-Hitschfeld

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20759v1)

**Summary:**

In this thesis, we make progress in two concrete directions in the vast landscape of hot QCD physics. The first one is quarkonium transport inside quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the high temperature phase of QCD. The second contribution we make is the development of tools to understand the process of hydrodynamization in QCD kinetic theory and their application to a simplified description where only a subset of the QCD scattering mechanisms are included. By doing this, we learn how memory of the initial condition is lost, following the recently proposed Adiabatic Hydrodynamized scenario.

## 44. The second order quasi-normal modes for an AdS$_4$ black brane

**Authors:** Wen-Bin Pan, ZhangPing Yu, Yi Ling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20683v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20683v1)

**Summary:**

We study the second order gravitational perturbations in an AdS black brane background. The resonance occurs at special positions in momentum space, where the amplitude becomes divergent. This phenomenon is in contrast to what is observed in asymptotically flat spacetime. The condition leading to the resonance is that the combined frequency of two sources coincides with one of another first order quasi-normal mode. The quadratic-to-linear ratio of amplitudes at horizon is found to be of order one in general.

## 45. Generating and Computing Quantum Periods in Exact WKB

**Authors:** Max Meynig

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20643v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20643v1)

**Summary:**

Rational integrals appear in quantum mechanics through asymptotic expansions of traces computed with the semiclassical symbol calculus. In particular, a novel formal series expansion for the trace of the Dirac delta of the quantization of a polynomial Hamiltonian is developed. Reducing these integrals modulo total derivatives results in a novel formula for normal forms of the integrals. In the case of one degree of freedom, the two dimensional residue formula relates the rational integrals to the quantum actions in the exact WKB formalism.

## 46. Open String Amplitudes: Singularities, Asymptotics, and New   Representations

**Authors:** Nima Arkani-Hamed, Carolina Figueiredo, Grant N. Remmen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20639v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20639v1)

**Summary:**

Open string amplitudes at tree level have been studied for over fifty years. There is no known analytic form for general $n$-point amplitudes, and their conventional representation in terms of worldsheet integrals does not make many of their most basic physical properties manifest. Recently, a formulation of these amplitudes exposing the underlying "binary geometry" via the use of "$u$" variables has given us many insights into their basic features. We present a new closed-form expression for the amplitude that for the first time gives its analytic continuation to all of kinematic space.
