## 0. Primordial Sharp Features through the Nonlinear Regime of Structure   Formation

**Authors:** Cl√©ment Stahl, Denis Werth, Vivian Poulin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02571v1)

**Summary:**

Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation give rise to sharp features in the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a unique window into the physics of inflation. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial features would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they are expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated N-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while oscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of primordial sharp features can persist.

## 1. Gravitational Vacuum Condensate Stars in the Effective Theory of Gravity

**Authors:** Emil Mottola

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02519v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02519v1)

**Summary:**

The low energy effective theory of gravity comprises two elements of quantum theory joined to classical general relativity. The first is the quantum conformal anomaly, which is responsible for macroscopic correlations on light cones and a stress tensor that can strongly modify the classical geometry at black hole horizons. The second is the formulation of vacuum energy in terms of an exact $4$-form abelian gauge field strength $F\!=\!dA$. The Schwarzschild black hole horizon is thereby replaced by a surface, with a positive surface tension and worldtube topology, separating regions of differing vacuum energy.

## 2. Minimal covariant quantum space-time

**Authors:** Alessandro Manta, Harold C. Steinacker

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02498v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss minimal covariant quantum space-time. We find an over-complete set of (quasi-) coherent states, with a large hierarchy between the uncertainty scale and the geometric curvature scale. This provides an interesting background for the IKKT model, leading to a $\mathfrak{hs}$-extended gravitational gauge theory, which is free of ghosts due to the constraints on phase space arising from the doubleton representation. In particular we find a set of $S^2$-bundle over a 3+1-dimensional $k=-1$ FLRW space- time.

## 3. Extended Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy: Ghost Condensate Dark   Energy with Sextic Dispersion Relation in de Sitter Spacetime

**Authors:** A. Ashoorioon, M. B. Jahani Poshteh, A. Yousefi-Sostani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02401v1)

**Summary:**

We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. We find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $M^2$ We conclude that the GC can be viewed as a type of supercondensate, with the ghost field velocity as the main factor of mass.

## 4. A Compact theorem on the compactness of ultra-compact objects with   monotonically decreasing matter fields

**Authors:** Shahar Hod

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02375v1)

**Summary:**

Self-gravitating horizonless ultra-compact objects that possess light rings have attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians in recent years. In the present compact paper we raise the following physically interesting question: Is there a lower bound on the global compactness parameters of these objects? Using the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations we explicitly prove that spatially regular ultra-Compact objects with monotonically decreasing density functions are characterized by the lower bound of their dimensionless compactness.

## 5. Courant Algebroid Relations, T-Dualities and Generalised Ricci Flow

**Authors:** Thomas C. De Fraja, Vincenzo Emilio Marotta, Richard J. Szabo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02318v1)

**Summary:**

The notion of Courant algebroid relation is used to introduce a definition of relation between divergence operators on CourantAlgebroids. By introducing invariant divergence operators, a notion of generalised T-duality between divergences is presented. This enables an analysis of the compatibility between T- duality and generalised Ricci flow, showing that the T-Dual of a solution of generalise Ricci Flow is also a solution for generalised Richec flow.

## 6. Elucidating the Dark Energy and Dark Matter Phenomena Within the   Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) Paradigm

**Authors:** Vesselin G. Gueorguiev, Andre Maeder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02282v1)

**Summary:**

The enigmatic phenomenon of dark energy (DE) is regarded as the elusive entity driving the accelerated expansion of our Universe. A plausible candidate for DE is the non-zero Einstein Cosmological Constant, yet it seemingly defies gravitational effects. We revisit the conformal scale factor and its defining equations within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm. We address the profound problem of the missing mass across galactic and extragalactic scales by deriving an MOND-like relation.

## 7. Bounce solutions with quantum vacuum effects of massive fields and   subsequent Starobinsky inflation

**Authors:** Wagno Cesar e Silva, Samuel W. P. Oliveira, Ilya L. Shapiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02281v1)

**Summary:**

We extend the previous work about the cosmological solutions with bounce without modifications of gravity or introducing an extra scalar field. The main finding was that the bounce is possible in the initially contracting Universe filled with matter. After a strong contraction, matter gains the equation of state close to the one of radiation, such that the effect on matter on the evolution of the FLRW metric disappears. However, this effect comes back owing to the quantum trace anomaly in the matter/radiation sector. We explore the weak impact of massive fields on the anomaly-driven bounce solution.

## 8. A Fuzzy Axiverse from String Theory

**Authors:** Andreas Schachner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02256v1)

**Summary:**

In this talk, I showcase models for fuzzy axion dark matter within the framework of type IIB string theory. I focus on axions originating from the Ramond-Ramond four-form in compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifold hypersurfaces. These models are amenable to cosmological tests if a substantial abundance of fuzzy dark matter is produced. I will also comment on applications of optimisation strategies based on automatic differentiation for exploring the string axiverse. This talk is partially based on arXiv:2412.12012.

## 9. Specific Heats for Rotating Quantum BTZ Black Holes in Extended   Thermodynamics

**Authors:** Roberto Nazario

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02156v1)

**Summary:**

In the framework of extended thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant $Lambda$ plays the role of a dynamical pressure $p$, its conjugate variable $V$ arises naturally. We find exact formulae for these heat capacities as functions of the three dimensionless parameters of the theory. In all cases considered, at least two physically realizable branches were observed, including both positive and negative heat capacities, signaling both stable and unstable black holes, respectively. Finally, we discuss the conjectured connection in the literature between the super-entropicity of a black hole and its instability.

## 10. Finite temperature QCD crossover at non-zero chemical potential: A   Dyson-Schwinger approach

**Authors:** Arpan Chatterjee, Marco Frasca, Anish Ghoshal, Stefan Groote

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02070v1)

**Summary:**

We study QCD at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential to derive the critical temperature at the chiral phase transition (crossover) We solve a set of Dyson--Schwinger partial differential equations using the exact solution for the Yang--Mills quantum field theory based on elliptical functions. We obtain a very good agreement with recent lattice computations regarding the dependence of thecritical temperature on the strong coupling scale. The analysis is analytically derived directly from QCD.

## 11. Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion   in super-renormalizable QFTs

**Authors:** Yizhuang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we address the issue regarding the high-power behavior of power-expansion/OPE-exp expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high- power terms in the coefficient functions. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent. The enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating.

## 12. Complex entanglement entropy for complex conformal field theory

**Authors:** Haruki Shimizu, Kohei Kawabata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02001v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02001v1)

**Summary:**

Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. We numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model. This confirms the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theories. We demonstrate that complex-valued entangler entropy characterizes complex conformist field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many body systems. This is based on non- hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states.

## 13. Renormalization of the Next-to-Leading-Power Soft Function for the   Drell-Yan Off-diagonal Channel

**Authors:** Martin Beneke, Yao Ji, Erik S√ºnderhauf, Xing Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01973v1)

**Summary:**

We renormalize the soft function entering the factorization and resummation of the $qg$ parton-scattering channel of the Drell-Yan process near the kinematic threshold. We then solve its renormalization-group equation. The result is that the process can be viewed as a series of subroutines. The process can also be seen as a set of subsets of a subroutine called the "Drell-Yan process" The process is called a "drell- yan" process if it can be seen to be a sub-routine of the process.
