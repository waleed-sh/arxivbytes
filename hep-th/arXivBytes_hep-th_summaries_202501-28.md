## 0. Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge   theories

**Authors:** Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper, Clement Delcamp

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16301v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group. It also enables us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians.

## 1. Phase Transitions in Large Language Models and the $O(N)$ Model

**Authors:** Youran Sun, Babak Haghighat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16241v1)

**Summary:**

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit unprecedentedly rich scaling behaviors. In physics, scaling behavior is closely related to phase transitions, critical phenomena, and field theory. To investigate the phase transition phenomena in LLMs, we reformulated the Transformer architecture as an $O(N)$ model. Our study reveals two distinct phase transitions corresponding to the temperature used in text generation and the model's parameter size. The first phase transition enables us to estimate the internal dimension of the model. The second phase transition is of \textit{higher-depth} and signals the emergence of new capabilities.

## 2. On the equation of state of U(1) lattice gauge theory in three   dimensions

**Authors:** Michele Caselle, Alessandro Mariani, Marco Panero, Antonio Smecca

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16185v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16185v1)

**Summary:**

We study the equation of state of three-dimensional compact U(1) gauge theory on the lattice by means of numerical simulations. We discuss the implications of our results for the spectrum of the theory, in connection with previous results from the literature. We also compare our findings to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories and comment on the continuum limit. The study was published in the journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

## 3. Acceleration as refrigeration: Acceleration-induced spontaneous symmetry   breaking in thermal medium

**Authors:** Maxim N. Chernodub

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16129v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that a uniform acceleration of matter produces an effect similar to cooling, thus leading, in particular, to the enhancement effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We derive a simple dependence of the critical temperature of a second-order phase transition on acceleration that, as we argue, should be applicable to a broad range of field theories. We consider an example of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a co-accelerating reference frame and show that the acceleration of hot gas of interacting fermions enhances the mass gap generation.

## 4. The Vlasov Bivector: A Parameter-Free Approach to Vlasov Kinematics

**Authors:** Finlay Gunneberg, Jonathan Gratus, Harvey Stanfield

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16104v1)

**Summary:**

Plasma kinetics is conventionally performed on the mass shell, a 7--dimensional time-phase space with a Vlasov vector field. We replace this with a bivector on an 8--dimensional sub-bundle of the tangent bundle. This has a number of advantages, which include working for lightlike and ultra-relativistic particles, non metric connections, and metric-free and premetric theories. We discuss the stress-energy tensor needed for the Einstein-Vlasov system.

## 5. Degree of freedom count in linear gauge invariant PDE systems

**Authors:** Simon Lyakhovich, Dmitri Piontkovski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein proposed a definition of the strength of such a theory and its degrees of freedom (DoF) based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the system. Here, we apply commutative algebra methods to this problem. Two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF. We prove another explicit formula for the DoF in terms of gauge symmetries and identities for homogeneous and certain more general systems.

## 6. Using Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy to simultaneously   alleviate the $H_{0}$ and $Ïƒ_{8}$ tensions

**Authors:** Stylianos A. Tsilioukas, Maria Petronikolou, Spyros Basilakos, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927v1)

**Summary:**

We present how Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy can alleviate $H_{0}$ and $sigma 8$ tensions simultaneously. This modified cosmological scenario is obtained by applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture to the Universe apparent horizon. We show that for particular regions of the parameter space the scenario at hand does lead to higher $H 0$ values. We verify this result performing a confrontation with observational data from Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC)

## 7. Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds

**Authors:** Rutwig Campoamor-Stursberg, Alessio Marrani, Michel Rausch de Traubenberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15892v1)

**Summary:**

Any Lie group manifold can be smoothly deformed into a 'soft' group manifold. The deformation is based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein. We show how to construct an infinite-dimensional(infinite-rank) generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $%G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to the deformed $G_c $ manifold.

## 8. The Signals of the Doomsday

**Authors:** Amartya Sengupta, Dejan Stojkovic, De-Chang Dai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15848v1)

**Summary:**

The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, possibly with a very long lifetime. Small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us, thus representing the signals of the doomsday. We calculate the spectrum of Higgs particles produced by such a bubble.

## 9. Recent Developments in Stochastic Inflation

**Authors:** R. P. Woodard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15843v1)

**Summary:**

This article is dedicated to the memory of Alexei Starobinsky. I begin with some recollections of him and then review the generalization of his wonderful stochastic formalism. This entails effective potentials generated by the usual field-dependent masses, as well as by field- dependent field strengths. I also discuss secular loop corrections which cannot be captured by stochastically techniques. I conclude with a discussion of nonlinear sigma models and gravity.

## 10. Reconstruction of QCD first-order phase transition from neutron star   measurements

**Authors:** Ronghao Li, Sophia Han, Zidu Lin, Lingxiao Wang, Kai Zhou, Shuzhe Shi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15810v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15810v1)

**Summary:**

The potential hadron-to-quark phase transition in neutron stars has not been fully understood as the property of cold, dense, and strongly interacting matter cannot be theoretically described. Large observational uncertainties and the limited number of observations currently make it challenging to strictly reconstruct the EoS. This work may pave the way for the understanding of the phase transition features in NSs using future $X$-ray and gravitational wave measurements. It is based on the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations.

## 11. Stationary scalar clouds around a rotating BTZ-like black hole in the   Einstein-bumblebee gravity

**Authors:** Fangli Quan, Fengjiao Li, Qiyuan Pan, Mengjie Wang, Jiliang Jing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15759v1)

**Summary:**

We have studied stationary clouds of massive scalar fields around a rotating BTZ-like black hole in the Einstein-bumblebee gravity, by imposing the Robin type boundary conditions at the AdS boundary. We establish, by scanning the parameter space, the existence of \textit{fundamental} stationary scalar clouds ($i.e. the overtone number $n=0$). In particular, we observe that the Lorentz symmetry breaking. parameter $s$ and the quantum number $k$ play an opposite role in determining scalar. clouds.

## 12. Thermal correlator at null infinity

**Authors:** Jiang Long, Hong-Yang Xiao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15714v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermal Carrollian correlators at null infinity in the real-time formalism. We derive the Feynman rules to calculate these correlators in the position space. We compute the bulk-to-bulk, bulk- to boundary and boundary- to-boundary propagators for massless scalar theory. We show how to compute four point correlator at finite temperature. The tree level correlators can be written as the summation of Barnes zeta functions and reduce to ones in the zero temperature limit.
