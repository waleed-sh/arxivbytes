## 0. Kaluza-Klein Supergravity 2025

**Authors:** M. J. Duff, B. E. W. Nilsson, C. N. Pope

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07710v1)

**Summary:**

We recall our work in the 1980s taking seriously the maximal eleven dimensions of supergravity. This involved Kaluza-Kein techniques that have found wider applications such as spontaneous compactification, holonomy and supersymmetry. Topology versus geometry, squashing and Higgs, vacuum stability and consistent truncations were also explored. We hope to use these techniques in the development of the next generation of super-gravity theory and theory of the Higgs boson in the next few years. Back to the page you came from.

## 1. The one-loop effective action from the coherent state path integral of   loop quantum gravity

**Authors:** Renata Ferrero, Muxin Han, Hongguang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07696v1)

**Summary:**

We adopt a novel approach to combine path integral methods with Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) Our approach builds upon the recently developed coherent state path integral formulation of LQG to compute the one-loop effective action. We compare this methodology with the conventional Quantum Field Theory (QFT) prescription for path integrals and extend the formalism to account for the dependence on boundary (coherent) states. We compute the effective action around flat spacetime obtaining analytical and numerical results in the long and short wavelength approximations, respectively.

## 2. Fock state probability changes in open quantum systems

**Authors:** Clare Burrage, Christian Käding

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07673v1)

**Summary:**

Open quantum systems are powerful effective descriptions of quantum systems interacting with their environments. Studying changes of Fock states probabilities can be intricate in this context since the prevailing description of open quantum dynamics is by master equations. In this article, we show that such problems can be circumvented by employing a recently developed path integral-based method for directly computing reduced density matrices in scalar quantum field theory. We show that, within our model, lighter neutrino masses would lead to a stronger distortion of the observable number of particles due to the interaction with the environment.

## 3. Classification of Gapped Domain Walls of Topological Orders in 2+1   dimensions: A Levin-Wen Model Realization

**Authors:** Yanyan Chen, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yuting Hu, Yidun Wan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07664v1)

**Summary:**

This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model. We achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, encompassing $e$-$m$ exchanging GDWs. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. We demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model.

## 4. Signatures of modified gravity from the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm   effect

**Authors:** Kimet Jusufi, Abdelrahman Yasser, Emmanuele Battista, Nader Inan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07613v1)

**Summary:**

To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector. It predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential. We determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the model.

## 5. On First-Order GLSM for Sigma Models

**Authors:** Viacheslav Krivorol

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07612v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07612v1)

**Summary:**

We review some recent developments in 1-st order GLSM construction, or so-called Gross-Neveu formalism for sigma models. Then, we formulate a general statement that answers the question of which generalized Gross- Neveu models are equivalent to s Sigma models on compact homogeneous Hermitian spaces of classical groups endowed with the normal metrics. We describe the general idea behind this framework and describe a 1-St order G LSM data from which the general generalized Gross NeveU model can be constructed.

## 6. Gauge Origami and BPS/CFT correspondence

**Authors:** Go Noshita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573v1)

**Summary:**

Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components. It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami system and its BPS/CFT correspondence. We also investigate quadratic relations among $qq$-characters and the representations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$. We demonstrate that the fusion of $qq’s of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-Brane $qq $-char characters.

## 7. Modified theories of gravity at different curvature scales

**Authors:** Susobhan Mandal, S. Shankaranarayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07437v1)

**Summary:**

General Relativity (GR) remains the cornerstone of gravitational physics. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum mechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark energy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes. This review provides an organized perspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the principles of GR they preserve or violate. The review also discusses the current and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including those probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and EEP.

## 8. Yukawa coupling, and inflationary correlation functions for a spectator   scalar via stochastic spectral expansion

**Authors:** Sourav Bhattacharya, Sudesh Kumar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07428v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a stochastic spectator scalar field coupled to fermion via the Yukawa interaction, in the inflationary de Sitter background. We find that the power spectrum and the spectral index corresponds to blue tilt with increasing $g$. The three point correlation function and non-Gaussianity corresponding to the density fluctuation has also been investigated. The increasing Yukawa coupling is shown to flatten the peak of the shape function in the squeezed limit. Also in this limit, the increase in the same is shows to increase the local non- Gaussianity parameter.

## 9. The Weinberg no-go theorem for cosmological constant and nonlocal   gravity

**Authors:** Salvatore Capozziello, Anupam Mazumdar, Giuseppe Meluccio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07321v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07321v1)

**Summary:**

Weinberg no-go theorem on cosmological constant. We show how a nonlocal gravitational interaction can circumvent it. In this perspective, one can describe the observed cosmic acceleration in terms of an effective field theory without relying on the fine-tuning of parameters or additional matter fields. In particular, Infinite Derivative Gravity theories hint at a possible understanding of the cosmologically constant as a non local gravitational effect on very large scales. We present our results in a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal.

## 10. Bound states of a fermion-dyon system

**Authors:** A. Yu. Loginov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07296v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07296v1)

**Summary:**

The bound states of fermions in the external field of an Abelian dyon are studied here both analytically and numerically. Their existence is due to the dyon's electric charge resulting from a polarization of the fermionic vacuum. The configuration of thedyon's field is not invariant under $P$ or $CP$ transformations. The dependence of the energy levels of a fermion-dyon system on a parameter of $CP $ violation is investigated.

## 11. Non-linear integral equations for the XXX spin-1/2 quantum chain with   non-diagonal boundary fields

**Authors:** Holger Frahm, Andreas Klümper, Dennis Wagner, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07229v1)

**Summary:**

The XXX spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with non-diagonal boundary fields represents a cornerstone model in the study of integrable systems with open boundaries. Despite its significance, solving this model exactly has remained a formidable challenge due to the breaking of $U(1)$   symmetry. We derive a set of nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) that encapsulate the exact spectrum of the model. This work lays the foundation for studying finite-size corrections and   conformal properties of otherintegrable spin chains.

## 12. Note on hidden zeros and expansions of tree-level amplitudes

**Authors:** Hao Huang, Ye Yang, Kang Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07173v1)

**Summary:**

In this note, we derive and interpret hidden zeros of tree-level amplitudes of various theories, including Yang-Mills, non-linear sigma model, special Galileon, Dirac-Born-Infeld, and gravity. We also show the detailed mechanism of eliminating such divergences. For unordered amplitudes such as gravitational ones, the kinematic condition for zeros causes potential divergence of propagators. Hidden zeros are attributed to zeros in bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes which can be easily proved.

## 13. Quantifying Quantumness in (A)dS spacetimes with Unruh-DeWitt Detector

**Authors:** Li-Juan Li, Xue-Ke Song, Liu Ye, Dong Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07167v1)

**Summary:**

Probing quantumness in curved spacetime is regarded as one of fundamental and important topics in the framework of relativistic quantum information. In this work, we focus on the theoretical feasibility of probing quantum properties in de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes via detectors. By employing the Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled with a massless scalar field, which is treated as an open system, quantum uncertainty and quantum coherence in both dS and AdS spacetime are investigated.

## 14. Gauge origami on broken lines

**Authors:** Sergej Monavari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07149v1)

**Summary:**

In analogy to Nekrasov's theory of gauge origami on intersecting branes, we introduce the gauge Origami moduli space on broken lines. We construct a virtual fundamental class and virtual structure sheaf, by which we define $K$-theoretic invariants. We compute its associated partition function for all ranks, and show that it reproduces the generating series of equivariant $Y$-genus. Finally, we relate our partition function with the virtual invariants of the Quot schemes of the affine plane and Nekrasova's partition function.
