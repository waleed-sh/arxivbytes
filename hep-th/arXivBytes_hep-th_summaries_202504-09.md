## 0. Renormalization Group in far-from-equilibrium states

**Authors:** Vladimir Rosenhaus, Michael Smolkin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06243v1)

**Summary:**

We study renormalization group flows in far-from-equilibrium states. The study is made tractable by focusing on states that are spatially homogeneous, time-independent, and scale-invariant. Backreaction may either cause a minor shift of the state in the IR, or completely change the nature of theState. Focusing on nearly marginal interactions, we construct an analog of the epsilon expansion and IR fixed points, with the scaling of the interaction rather than the spacetime dimension.

## 1. Nonlinear Tails of Gravitational Waves in Schwarzschild Black Hole   Ringdown

**Authors:** Alex Kehagias, Antonio Riotto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06224v1)

**Summary:**

 Schwarzschild black holes evolve toward their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, which decay over time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We derive this power law analytically for the second-order even gravitational perturbations, demonstrating that it is determined by the fact that theSecond-order source decays as the inverse square of the distance. Quadratic gravitational modes with multipole $\ell$ decay according to a law $\sim t^{-2\ell-1}$, in contrast to the linear Price law scaling. Consequently, nonlinear tails may persist longer than their linear counterparts.

## 2. Factorizing Defects from Generalized Pinning Fields

**Authors:** Fedor K. Popov, Yifan Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06203v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06203v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce generalized pinning fields in conformal field theory that model a large class of critical impurities at large distance. We provide a rigorous definition of such defects as certain unbounded operators on the Hilbert space and prove that when inserted on codimension-one surfaces they factorize the spacetime into two halves. The factorization channels are further constrained by symmetries in the bulk. As a corollary, we solve suchcritical impurities in the 2d minimal models and establish the factorization phenomena previously observed for localized mass deformations in the 3d ${\rm O}(N)$ model.

## 3. No-scale supergravity

**Authors:** Fabio Zwirner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06190v1)

**Summary:**

In no-scale supergravity models, the gravitino mass slides along a flat direction of the potential with vanishing energy. The still unsolved problems of quantum stability can already be addressed, with some results, at the level of supergravity compactifications. Their solution (if any) will eventually require a better understanding of superstring theories. It includes comments on their versions with extended supersymmetry, on their higher-dimensional origin and on how their problems can be addressed. It also describes some qualitative features of no- scale models that relate them to a possible dynamical generation of the hierarchies.

## 4. Noncommutative resolutions and CICY quotients from a non-abelian GLSM

**Authors:** Johanna Knapp, Joseph McGovern

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06147v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06147v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss a one-parameter non-abelian GLSM with gauge group. The associated Calabi-Yau differential operator has a second point of maximal unipotent monodromy. We compute the associated Gopakumar-Vafa invariants up to genus $11$ incorporating their torsion refinement. We identify two integral symplectic bases constructed from topological data of the mirror geometries in either phase. We conclude that the associated model appears to be a hybrid model with continuous unbroken gauge symmetry and cubic superpotential.

## 5. Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with Internal Interactions   resulting in SO(10) and a Possible Probe through Stochastic Gravitational   Wave Background

**Authors:** Gregory Patellis, Danai Roumelioti, Stelios Stefas, George Zoupanos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06142v1)

**Summary:**

The unification of conformal and fuzzy gravities with internal interactions is based on the facts that the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions. Both gravitational theories considered here have been formulated in a gauge theoretic way. Both schemes are examined at 1-loop level considering suitable spontaneous symmetry breakings to a SO(10) grand unified theory. Each channel is examined against proton lifetime experimental bounds and its observation potential through gravitational signal from cosmic strings production is discussed.

## 6. In search of almost generic Calabi-Yau 3-folds

**Authors:** Thorsten Schimannek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06115v1)

**Summary:**

We call a projective Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-fold almost generic if it has only isolated nodes as singularities and the homology classes of all of the exceptional curves in an analytic small resolution are non-trivial but torsion. In this way we explicitly construct two quintic CY 3-folds with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-torsion, two octics with $X_{(6,6)}\subset\mathbb {P}^5_{1,1,2,.2,3,3}$ and deduce the existence of a complete intersection. Via mirror symmetry, the examples give new geometric interpretations to several AESZ Calabi

## 7. Two-Loop Renormalization of a Chiral $SU(2)$ Gauge Theory in Dimensional   Regularization with Non-Anticommuting $γ_5$

**Authors:** Paul Kühler, Dominik Stöckinger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06080v1)

**Summary:**

Higher order calculations in chiral gauge theories such as the Electroweak Standard Model require a sound treatment of the notoriously problematic $\gamma_5$-matrix in Dimensional Regularization. In the all-order consistent BMHV scheme anticommutativity has to be sacrificed, resulting in spurious breakings of BRST invariance. The restoration of which necessitates finite, symmetry-restoring counterterms. We present the first complete non-Abelian two-loop result for the case of $SU(2)$, which is of particular interest to the Standard Model.

## 8. Cosmic inflation in non-perturbative quantum gravity

**Authors:** Alexey S. Koshelev, Abhishek Naskar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06035v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06035v1)

**Summary:**

String field theory motivated infinite-derivative models lead to non-local gravity modifications which form a promising class of quantum gravity candidates. In this paper we investigate effects of non-locality on the three-point function (the bi-spectrum) during cosmic inflation. The study is done in an Einstein frame with an infinite-Derivative scalar field Lagrangian minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert term. We find that $f_{NL}$ is non-trivially sensitive to the values of complex masses and this can reduce the parameter space of gravity modifications.

## 9. Torsion in two dimensions: autoparallels, symmetries, and applications   to black holes

**Authors:** Jens Boos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06013v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06013v1)

**Summary:**

We explore spacetime torsion in a two-dimensional setting. Without invoking field equations of a particular gravitational theory, we develop visualization techniques. We then utilize these structures to derive general properties of surface gravities of static black holes whose near-horizon region features approximately constant torsional fields. Under certain assumptions, the two- dimensional results can be lifted to four dimensions. The results can then be applied to black holes in three and four dimensions, as well as the universe as a whole.

## 10. Consistency Relation for Fixed Point Dynamics

**Authors:** Oleg Antipin, Alan Pinoy, Francesco Sannino, Shahram Vatani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05988v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05988v1)

**Summary:**

We gain insight on the fixed point dynamics of $d$ dimensional quantum field theories. We first derive a self-consistent relation between the $d-\epsilon$ scaling exponents. We then demonstrate that to account for an interacting fixed point in the original theory the related scaling exponent must be multi-valued in $d. We discuss examples such as the QCD Banks-Zaks infrared fixed point, QCD at large number of flavors, as well as the O(N) model in four dimensions.

## 11. Generalised Symmetries in Particle Physics

**Authors:** Joe Davighi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05960v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05960v1)

**Summary:**

In this talk I review various notions of generalised global symmetry. These include higher-form, higher-group, and non-invertible symmetry. All these notions have had profound impact on quantum field theory research in the last decade. I highlight various applications of these new symmetries in particle physics, focussing on theories beyond the Standard Model. Areas touched upon include axions, gauge unification, dark matter, neutrino masses, and flavour hierarchies. The talk is free and open to the public.

## 12. A Lorentz Covariant Matrix Model for Bosonic M2-Branes: Nambu Brackets   and Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations

**Authors:** So Katagiri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05940v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05940v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a Lorentz covariant matrix model as a nonperturbative formulation of the bosonic M2-brane in M-theory. Unlike previous approaches relying on the light-cone gauge or symmetry-based constructions, our model retains full 11-dimensional LorentZ invariance. The resulting model exhibits RVPD symmetry, admits particle-like and noncommutative membrane solutions, and lays the foundation for a Lorenntz-invariant matrix description of M1-branes.

## 13. The complete trans-series for conserved charges in the Lieb-Liniger   model

**Authors:** Zoltán Bajnok, János Balog, Ramon Miravitllas, Dennis le Plat, István Vona

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05932v1)

**Summary:**

We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans- series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor. We conclude that our results are consistent with the predictions of the theory of rapidity.

## 14. Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics

**Authors:** Luca Buoninfante

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900v1)

**Summary:**

Strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. We show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory. This unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. It provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation.

## 15. Gravitational waves from primordial black hole dominance: The effect of   inflaton decay rate

**Authors:** Daniel del-Corral, K. Sravan Kumar, João Marto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon and could experience instabilities that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects.

## 16. Notes on color reductions and $γ$ traces

**Authors:** Oliver Schnetz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05853v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05853v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of these notes is to give a self-contained, proved account of the basic results with particular emphasis on color reductions. We fine tune existing algorithms to make calculations at high loop orders possible. We present efficient algorithms to calculate the color factors for the $SU(N)$ gauge group and to evaluate $\gamma$ traces. We show how to use these algorithms to create color-reductions for the gauge group. We also show how these algorithms can be used to calculate color reductions for gauge groups.

## 17. Graphical functions with spin

**Authors:** Oliver Schnetz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05850v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05850v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of graphical functions is generalized from scalar theories to theories with spin, leading to a numerator structure in Feynman integrals. The main part of this article treats the case of positive integer spin, which is obtained from spin $1/2$ theories after the evaluation of $\gamma$ traces. As an application, we calculateFeynman periods in Yukawa-$\phi^4$ (Gross-Neveu-Yukawa) theory up to loop order eight.

## 18. The off-shell one- and two-loop box recovered from intersection theory

**Authors:** Burkhard Eden

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05843v1)

**Summary:**

We advertise intersection theory for generalised hypergeometric functions. We study two-parameter representations of the off-shell one- and two-loop box graphs in exactly four-dimensional configuration space. We use intersection theory to derive Pfaffian systems of equations on related sets of master integrals. We solve for the box and double box integrals reproducing the known expressions. Finally, we use a trick to re-derive the double box from a two- parameter Euler integral.

## 19. Exact results for spin glass criticality

**Authors:** Gesualdo Delfino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05842v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05842v1)

**Summary:**

In recent years scale invariant scattering theory has provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.

## 20. The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical   estimation

**Authors:** Albert Escrivà

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814v1)

**Summary:**

We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry. We find that the threshold for PBH formation does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in thetype-II region with the peak value of the critical compaction function $r_m$ being a minimum. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the types-I and type-II regions may have been overestimated.

## 21. A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature   fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism

**Authors:** Albert Escrivà

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable.

## 22. Thermodynamic supercriticality and complex phase diagram for the AdS   black hole

**Authors:** Zhen-Ming Xu, Robert B. Mann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05708v1)

**Summary:**

The Widom line of AdS black holes segregates the supercritical domain of the phase diagram into two disparate zones. As the system traverses the line, it undergoes a transition from one supercritical phase to another, while maintaining the continuity of its thermodynamic state functions. This behavior is fundamentally different from that below the critical point, where crossing the coexistence line results in discontinuities of thermodynamicState functions. The Widom Line enables a thermodynamic crossover between single-phase states without traversing the spinodal that emerges in the critical region.

## 23. Remarks on the locality of generalized global symmetries

**Authors:** Owen Gwilliam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05626v1)

**Summary:**

We examine generalized global symmetries as a kind of compactly supported cohomology. Physics naturally suggests a generalization of factorization algebras aimed at capturing nonperturbative information. We explain how higher group symmetry offer examples of this generalization. We explore how continuous generalized symmetry and anomalies can be cast in this framework. We conclude with an extension of the nonabelian Poincar\'e duality of Salvatore and Lurie to quantum field theory.

## 24. Shadow radius and classical scattering analysis of two secondary hair   Horndeski black holes

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05602v1)

**Summary:**

We perform shadow radius analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole (CHB) and the naked singularity (NS) NS versions of CHB and bH arise from the charge extension of their photon spheres, while there is no NS version for MC. One branch (i) from the CHB is a point in the horizon realization but it shows up on the photon sphere and shadow radius. i-NS branch and NS play different roles from CHB, bH, and MC.
