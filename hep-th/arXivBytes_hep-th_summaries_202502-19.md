## 0. AInstein: Numerical Einstein Metrics via Machine Learning

**Authors:** Edward Hirst, Tancredi Schettini Gherardini, Alexander G. Stapleton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13043v1)

**Summary:**

A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in that patch, with the associated Einstein conditions. We test our method for the case of spheres represented with 2 patches in dimensions $2,3,4,5$ but it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can be put on spheres in dimension $4, 5.

## 1. Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: Asymptotic Observables

**Authors:** Simon Caron-Huot, Mathieu Giroux, Holmfridur S. Hannesdottir, Sebastian Mizera, Celina Pasiecznik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13021v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13021v1)

**Summary:**

Asymptotic observables are classes of measurable quantities predicted by quantum field theory. In gapped theories with trivial infrared dynamics, these include scattering amplitudes, expectation values of operators approaching infinity, inclusive cross sections, etc. We argue for a unified picture in which various asymptotics are related by analytic continuation embodying new versions of crossing symmetry. As an application, we discuss the exponentiation of infrared divergences for inclusive observables in Quantum Electrodynamics using time-folded contours. Finally, we outline prospects for a systematic study of analyticity properties of asymptic observables using the Fourier-Bros-Iagolnitzer transform.

## 2. Geometric and General Relativistic Techniques for Non-relativistic   Quantum Systems

**Authors:** Aonghus Hunter-McCabe, Brian P. Dolan, Peter Coles

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13009v1)

**Summary:**

This thesis explores the application of differential geometric and general relativistic techniques to deepen our understanding of quantum mechanical systems. We focus on three systems, employing these mathematical frameworks to uncover subtle features within each. First, we examine Unruh radiation in the context of an accelerated two-state atom, determining transition frequencies via first-order perturbation theory. Next, we investigate the quantum Hall effect in a spherical geometry using the Dirac operator for non-interacting fermions in a background magnetic field. We examine the AdS/CMT correspondence through a bulk fermionic field in an RN-AdS$_4$ background.

## 3. U(1) Gauging, Continuous TQFTs, and Higher Symmetry Structures

**Authors:** Adrien Arbalestrier, Riccardo Argurio, Luigi Tizzano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12997v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum field theories can exhibit various generalized symmetry structures. Higher-group symmetries and non-invertible symmetry defects are particularly prominent. In this work, we explore a new general scenario in which these two structures are intertwined. This phenomenon arises in four dimensions when gauging one of multiple $U(1)$ 0-form symmetry in the presence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We illustrate this with two distinct models that flow to an IR gapless phase and a gapped phase.

## 4. Late-time behaviors of scalar field modes for a collapsing null shell   spacetime and for the Unruh state in Schwarzschild spacetime

**Authors:** Shohreh Gholizadeh Siahmazgi, Paul R. Anderson, Alessandro Fabbri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12910v1)

**Summary:**

The modes for a massless minimally coupled scalar field are investigated for the Unruh state for Schwarzschild spacetime and the "in" vacuum state for a spacetime in which a spherically symmetric null shell collapses to form a nonrotating black hole. In both cases there are two different sets of solutions to the mode equation that make up the state. For both spacetimes, one set of modes oscillates forever with no damping of the oscillations and the other set approaches zero at late times.

## 5. Universality and emergent effective fluid from jets and string breaking   in the massive Schwinger model using tensor networks

**Authors:** Romuald A. Janik, Maciej A. Nowak, Marek M. Rams, Ismail Zahed

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12901v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12901v1)

**Summary:**

A nearly perfect and chargeless effective fluid behavior appears around the mid-rapidity region with a universal energy-pressure relationship. The evolution of energy and pressure is strongly correlated with the rise of the spatial entanglement entropy, indicating a key role of quantum dynamics. Some of these observations may be used to analyze high multiplicity jet fragmentation events, energy-energy and energy-charge correlators at current collider energies.

## 6. Compact kinks in a modified Christ-Lee model

**Authors:** F. M. Hahne, R. Thibes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12850v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12850v1)

**Summary:**

We study compact kinks in a modified Christ-Lee model where the potential is a non-analytic function at the minima. We consider cases in which the potential has a double well shape, a triple well shape and cases with a false vacuum. We also study the collision of such kinks and their dependence on the solitons velocity and on the potential parameters. Several interesting dynamical processes are reported, such as the formation of central oscillons for some high velocity collisions, and the decoupling of subkinks from the larger kink.

## 7. Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings   with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a   multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model

**Authors:** Geng-Chen Wang, Hong-Bo Jin, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828v1)

**Summary:**

Detecting gravitational wave background from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors.

## 8. What is Positive Geometry?

**Authors:** Kristian Ranestad, Bernd Sturmfels, Simon Telen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12815v1)

**Summary:**

This article serves as an introduction to the special volume on Positive Geometry in the journal Le Matematiche. We attempt to answer the question in the title by describing the origins and objects of positive geometry at this early stage of its development. We discuss the problems addressed in the volume and report on the progress. We also list some open challenges. We conclude by discussing some of the problems that remain to be solved in positive geometry. We hope that this article has helped you understand the subject better.

## 9. Geometric Flavours of Quantum Field Theory on a Cauchy Hypersurface:   Gaussian Analysis for the Hamiltonian Formalism and Applications to Cosmology

**Authors:** David Mart√≠nez-Crespo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760v1)

**Summary:**

This thesis explores Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on curved spacetimes. In particular it studies the theory of the scalar field described through its configurations over a Cauchy hypersurface. It is focused on mathematical consistency based on analytic and geometric tools. The work begins by extending the Koopman-van Hove formalism of classical statistical mechanics to CSFT. It reveals features inherent to both CSFT and QFT, that help delineate the genuine quantum features of a theory.
