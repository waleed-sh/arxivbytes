## 0. Sub-Horizon Amplification of Curvature Perturbations: A New Route to   Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Debottam Nandi, Rohan Roy, Simran Yadav, Arnab Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16059v1)

**Summary:**

The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) This process also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant approach used in the early universe. We demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow- roll parameter can indeed enhance the scalarpower spectrum through sub-horizon growth. Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs.

**Authors:** Ashutosh Dwibedi, Dani Rose J Marattukalam, Nandita Padhan, Arghya Chatterjee, Sabyasachi Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16049v1)

**Summary:**

 rotational aspect of quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions has attracted considerable interest. This work explores the effect of the Coriolis force, arising due to this rotation, on the shear viscosity of the medium. The degree of suppression depending on the ratio between the relaxation time and the rotational period, we show. We obtain a traditional valley-like pattern for all components with reduced magnitudes compared to the valley- like isotropic one encounters in the absence of rotation.

## 2. Reinforcement Learning and Metaheuristics for Feynman Integral Reduction

**Authors:** Mao Zeng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16045v1)

**Summary:**

The integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals is an important computational bottleneck in modern perturbative calculations in quantum field theory. Our first proposed method is reinforcement learning, which involves an agent interacting with an environment. The second method is using metaheuristics, e.g. simulated annealing, to minimize the computational cost as a black-box function of numerical priority values. Remarkably, both methods lead to IBP reduction schemes that are more efficient than human-designed algorithms.

## 3. RGUP Corrections to Scalar and Fermionic Fields

**Authors:** Gaurav Bhandari, S. D. Pathak, Vikash Kumar Ojha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16043v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the Relativistic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (RGUP) effects on scalar and fermionic fields using the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation. Modified equations of motion, Hamiltonians, and stress-energy tensors are derived in Minkowski spacetime. This framework, applicable to high-energy physics, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmology, integrates quantum gravity into relativistic field theories. We show that spin connections maintain gravitational consistency.

## 4. Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides

**Authors:** Zihan Zhou, Giovanni Maria Tomaselli, Irvin Martínez-Rodríguez, Jingping Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025v1)

**Summary:**

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction of a star's gravitational binding energy, we transition to the second stage, where wemodel the disrupted material as free particles.

## 5. Wilson lines with endpoints in 3d CFT

**Authors:** Nabil Iqbal, Navonil Neogi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16017v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16017v1)

**Summary:**

In Abelian gauge theories with dynamical matter, Wilson lines can end on the insertions of charged fields. We study the endpoints of Wilson lines in large $N$ bosonic QED$_3$. at its critical point. We calculate the field-strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ in the presence of the line with endpoint and discuss a state-operator correspondence for the end points. We also discuss the existence of an OPE that allows two open-ended Wilson lines to be glued together into a single line.

## 6. Probing New Physics Through CP Violation in $B_{(s)}\to Vμ^+μ^-$   Decays

**Authors:** Robert Fleischer, Martijn van Hamersveld, Tim Kortekaas, Anders Rehult, K. Keri Vos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16014v1)

**Summary:**

Rare decays are key players for testing the Standard Model. The current experimental data for their decay rates and angular observables show tensions with theoretical predictions that may be indications of New Physics. We present a strategy to extract the relevant short-distance coefficients in the presence of new sources of CP violation. We are looking forward to the implementation of these strategies at the future high-precision frontier of flavour physics. We discuss also the link to leptonic $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu-$ decays.

## 7. Unveiling the electrodynamic nature of spacetime collisions

**Authors:** Siddharth Boyeneni, Jiaxi Wu, Elias R. Most

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15978v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the geometrical nature of spacetime. By recasting Einstein's equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of abinary black hole collision. The results are published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 8. Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity

**Authors:** Leron Borsten, Michael J. Duff, Dimitri Kanakaris, Hyungrok Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973v1)

**Summary:**

 Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. We show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-Muller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory. We propose a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearizedgravity and its dual.

## 9. Consistency between Bulk and Boundary Causalities in Asymptotically   Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes

**Authors:** Lei Fu, Keisuke Izumi, Daisuke Yoshida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15910v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the consistency between bulk and boundary causalities in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. We derive a general formula that provides sufficient conditions for time advance, where bulk propagation arrives earlier than any boundary propagation. We demonstrate that the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg theory exhibits time advance when one or a linear combination of the coupling constants is positive and below an upper bound determined by the AdS length scale.

## 10. Dimensional Uplift in Conformal Field Theories

**Authors:** Ferdinando Gliozzi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15904v1)

**Summary:**

The n-point functions of any Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in $d$ dimensions can always be interpreted as spatial restrictions of corresponding functions in a higher-dimensional CFT with dimension $d'> d$. In particular, when a four-point function in $ d$ dimensions has a known conformal block expansion, this expansion can be easily extended to $d'=d+2$ due to a remarkable identity among conformal blocks. We provide an elementary proof of this identity using simple algebraic properties of the Casimir operators.

## 11. An equivalence theorem for algebraic and functorial QFT

**Authors:** Severin Bunk, James MacManus, Alexander Schenkel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15759v1)

**Summary:**

This paper develops a novel approach to functorial quantum field theories (FQFTs) in the context of Lorentzian geometry. The key challenge is that globally hyperbolic LorentZian bordisms between two Cauchy surfaces cannot change the topology of the Cauchey surface. This is addressed and solved by introducing a more flexible concept of bordism pseudo-operad. The main result of this paper is an equivalence theorem between such globallyHyperbolic FQFTS and algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT)

## 12. Form factors from string amplitudes

**Authors:** Qu Cao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15702v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a stringy model for $n$-point tree-level form factor with the off-shell operator in the scalar and gluon theories. In the field-theory limit ($\alpha'\to0$), the stringy form factor reduces to the form factor. This helps us to investigate the hidden properties of the field theory form factors, manifest the factorization and soft behaviors, and uncover more non-trivial relations between form factors and scattering amplitudes.

## 13. A systematic approach to $\ell$-loop planar integrands from the   classical equation of motion

**Authors:** Yi-Xiao Tao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15701v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter, we present a recursive method for $\ell$-loop planar integrands in colored quantum field theories. We start with the classical equation of motion and then pick out the comb component, which will help us to define the loop kernels. Our method can be easily generalized to generalQuantumField theories, even non-Lagrangian theories, to obtain the planar part of the whole $'$- loop integrand. We conclude with a recursion formula for the $''-loop integranded planar Integrands.

## 14. Dynamics of late time universe in $f(Q)$ gravity

**Authors:** Bikash Chandra Roy, Aroonkumar Beesham, Bikash Chandra Paul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15680v1)

**Summary:**

We construct cosmological model in nonmetricity scalar functional gravitational Lagrangian $f(Q)$ which describes the dynamical evolution of the late accelerating universe. The energy conditions for a realistic scenario are examined and noted that the effective fluid violates the strong energy condition. We also analyzed the variation of the effective EoS parameter and found that the matter content in the universe favours quintessence type fluid in all the $f('Q')-gravity theories. The transition of the universe from a deceleration to an accelerating phase is investigated.

## 15. Quantum Corrections and Extremality: A Generalized Universal Relation

**Authors:** Ankit Anand

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15646v1)

**Summary:**

Logarithmic corrections to the entropy of extremal black holes have proven effective in precisely matching the microscopic degeneracies obtained from string-theoretic. A non-perturbative quantum correction manifests as an exponential term in the black hole entropy. In this work, we extend the universal relation proposed by Goon and Penco by deriving a generalized form where entropy is not just the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our analysis treats entropy as a general function of the horizon radius. With the help of that, we formulate the generalized universal relation.

## 16. Warm multi natural inflation

**Authors:** Asuka Ito, Rudnei O. Ramos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15606v1)

**Summary:**

Multi natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET.
