## 0. On the Holographic Dual of a Symmetry Operator at Finite Temperature

**Authors:** Jonathan J. Heckman, Max Hübner, Chitraang Murdia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16427v1)

**Summary:**

Topological symmetry operators of holographic large $N$ CFT$_D$'s are dual to dynamical branes in the gravity dual AdS$_{D+1}$. We use this correspondence to establish a dictionary between thermal expectation values of symmetry operators in the Euclidean CFT $_D$, and the evaluation of gravitational saddles. We illustrate with some representative examples, including gravity in AdS $_3$, duality / triality defects in 4D Super Yang-Mills theory, and the dual of R-symmetry operators probing 5D BPS black holes.

## 1. Apparent $w<-1$ and a Lower $S_8$ from Dark Axion and Dark Baryons   Interactions

**Authors:** Justin Khoury, Meng-Xiang Lin, Mark Trodden

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16415v1)

**Summary:**

Dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea.

## 2. Open String Axiverse

**Authors:** Rudin Petrossian-Byrne, Giovanni Villadoro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16387v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16387v1)

**Summary:**

Localized charged fields are a general feature of many realistic string compactifications. In four dimensions they can lead to a multitude of perturbatively-exact global symmetries. If spontaneously broken, they generate a new axiverse compatible with post-inflationary evolutions. They can also be used to predict the state of the universe in a given time period. For more information on localized charged field theory, visit http://www.sciencemag.org/article/localized-charged- fields-are-a-general-feature of realistic-string compactifications and can be used to predict state of the world in four dimensions.

## 3. Modular transport in two-dimensional conformal field theory

**Authors:** Mihail Mintchev, Diego Pontello, Erik Tonni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16368v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quantum transport generated by the bipartite entanglement in two-dimensional conformal field theory at finite density. The modular analogues of the Johnson-Nyquist law and of the fluctuation-dissipation relation are found, which encode the thermal nature of the modular evolution. We investigate the mean values of the associated currents and their quantum fluctuations in the finite density representation, which describe the properties of the Modular quantum transport. We conclude that the modular quantum transport is a form of quantum teleportation.

## 4. Finite-coupling spectrum of O(N) model in AdS

**Authors:** Jonáš Dujava, Petr Vaško

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16345v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16345v1)

**Summary:**

We focus on the non-singlet sectors, namely the anti-symmetric and symmetric traceless irreducible representations of the $1/N$ group. We present general formulas for the contribution of a $t$-channel conformal block to the anomalous dimensions of $s$- channel double-twist operators. Up to some technical details, this eventually leads to the complete picture of $1-N$ corrections to the data in the interacting theory.

## 5. On the finite basis of two-loop `t Hooft-Veltman Feynman integrals

**Authors:** Piotr Bargiela, Tong-Zhi Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16299v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16299v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate the finite basis topologies of two-loop dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals in the `t Hooft-Veltman scheme in the Standard Model. We present a functionally distinct finite basis of Master Integrals which spans the whole transcendental space of all two- loop Feyn man integrals with external momenta in four dimensions. Our work will allow for a reduction in the computational complexity required for providing high-precision predictions for future high-multiplicity collider observables, both analytically and numerically.

## 6. Refined BPS numbers on compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds from Wilson loops

**Authors:** Minxin Huang, Sheldon Katz, Albrecht Klemm, Xin Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16270v1)

**Summary:**

We relate the counting of refined BPS numbers on compact elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau 3-folds $X$ to Wilson loop expectations values in the gauge theories that emerge in various rigid local limits of the 5d supergravity theory. In these local limits $X_*$ the volumes of curves in certain classes go to infinity, the corresponding very massive M2-brane states can be treated as Wilson loop particles. The resulting ansatz for the complete refined topological partition function on $X $ is written in terms of the proportionality coefficients which depend only on the $epsilon$ deformations.

## 7. Spherically symmetric horizonless solutions and their frozen states in   Bardeen spacetime with Proca field

**Authors:** Rong Zhang, Yong-Qiang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16265v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we construct a static spherical symmetric Bardeen-Proca star (BPS) model. The introduction of the Proca field disrupts the formation of event horizons, ensuring that these solutions are globally regular throughout the spacetime. We find that when the magnetic charge is sufficiently large, solutions with a critical horizon emerge as $\omega \rightarrow 0$. For the light ring, we find that the light rings always appear in pairs, located on both sides of the critical horizon. For timelike circular orbits, we investigate their distribution in the Spacetime of BPSs.

## 8. Super-Higher-Form Symmetries

**Authors:** P. A. Grassi, S. Penati

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16182v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16182v1)

**Summary:**

Using a supergeometry formulation, we find that ordinary higher-form-symmetries nicely combine with supersymmetry to give rise to a much larger spectrum of topological conserved (super)currents. These can be classified as a supersymmetric version of Chern-Weil symmetries, and a brand new set of geometric-Chern-Weils. For N=1 super-Maxwell theory in various dimensions, we build the topological operators generating these super-higher-form symmetry and construct defects carrying non-trivial charges.

## 9. Exciton Binding Energies in 2D Materials: Insights from Braneworld   Physics

**Authors:** Antoine Honet, Michaël Sarrazin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16174v1)

**Summary:**

In the present work, we introduce a new interpretation of exciton binding energies in two-dimensional (2D) materials using concepts from brane physics. We adapt the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati-Shifman mechanism to a (2+1)-dimensional brane in a (3+1-D spacetime. This interdisciplinary approach bridges high-energy and condensed matter physics, offering a new didactic representation of excitons in low-dimensional systems.

## 10. The entropy of dynamical de Sitter horizons

**Authors:** Jinan Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16138v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical cosmological event horizon. The formula is valid to leading order for perturbations of a stationary asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. We generalize Gibbons and Hawking's first law of event horizons to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non- stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmologically event horizon, and introduce a nontrivial correction term.

## 11. Effects of tau-neutrino detection on non-standard interactions at DUNE   with a short discussion on the nature of neutrino mixing

**Authors:** Xin Yue Yu, Zishen Guan, William Dallaway, Ushak Rahaman, Nikolina Ilic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16124v1)

**Summary:**

The strongest observable NSI effect in the. tau neutrino appearance probabilities arises from. $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$. We have studied the hierarchy sensitivity, CP violation sensitivity and octant sensitivity of DUNE. We have also studied the detection sensitivity of NSI phases and the future constaints on NSI parameters from the tau. appearance channels in Dune. These studies emphasize the importance of incorporating $\nu_ \tau$ detection in long-baseline neutrinos experiments.

## 12. Partially massless spin 5/2 and supersymmetry

**Authors:** Yu. M. Zinoviev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16004v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate on the partially massless spin 5/2 supermultiplet. We use a frame-like gauge-invariant formalism to describe free fields. We also use the Fradkin-Vasiliev formalist to construct interactions. We face ambiguities related to field redef definitions. We demonstrate how these ambiguisms can be resolved using unfolded equations. The paper is published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 13. Holographic deformations of matrix models

**Authors:** Alfred Bovon, Henning Samtleben, Dimitrios Tsimpis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15954v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15954v1)

**Summary:**

We study maximal supergravity in two dimensions, obtained from reduction of IIA supergravity on an $S^8$ sphere. The theory captures the low-lying fluctuations around the non-conformal D0-brane near-horizon geometry, dual to operators in the BFSS matrix model. We construct half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions preserving $SO(p)times SO(9-p)$ subgroups of the original $SO (9)$ symmetry.

## 14. Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction

**Authors:** Etsuko Itou, Akira Matsumoto, Yu Nakayama, Toshiki Onagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15874v1)

**Summary:**

Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenburg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$

## 15. All-loop planar integrands in Yang-Mills theory from recursion

**Authors:** Qu Cao, Fan Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15860v1)

**Summary:**

In gauge theories, planar loop integrands are subtle to defined and obtained due to the existence of scaleless integrals. In this letter, we generalize the recursion methods based on cut equations arXiv:2412.21027, originally developed for scalar theories, to gluons in pure Yang-Mills theory. We provide the results up to the two-loop five-point integrand and the simplified result in the large-$D$ limit for the three-loop four-point case.

## 16. Anisotropic Topological Field Theory

**Authors:** Emil Albrychiewicz, Andrés Franco Valiente

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15856v1)

**Summary:**

We study anisotropic scaling limits of topological field theories using tropical geometry. We demonstrate the tropicalization for the 2D BF theory and generalize the prescription to topological Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons theories. We leave several open questions such as potential connections to JT gravity and an isotropic conformal field theory. We call the tropical limit of the BF theory, the \textit{TBF} theory, which is a generalization of BF theory with an additional adjoint-valued field $T$ that enforces a projectability condition.

## 17. Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities

**Authors:** Yoshinori Namikawa, Yuji Odaka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791v1)

**Summary:**

We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to relate Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties. We also prove results on the local behaviour of (singular) hyperKahler metrics.

## 18. Copenhagen Survey on Black Holes and Fundamental Physics

**Authors:** Alice Y. Chen, Phil Halper, Niayesh Afshordi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15776v1)

**Summary:**

A total of 85 completed surveys were returned out of 151 registered participants of the "Black holes Inside and out" conference, held in Copenhagen in 2024. The survey asked questions about the nature of black holes and some of the most contentious issues in fundamental physics. The only statement that gains majority approval (by 68% of participants) was that the Big Bang means that "the universe evolved from a hot dense state" This provides reasons for caution in describing ideas as consensus in the scientific community when a more nuanced view may be justified.
