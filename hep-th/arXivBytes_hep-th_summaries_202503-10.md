## 0. Quantum State Designs from Minimally Random Quantum Circuits

**Authors:** Jonathon Riddell, Katja Klobas, Bruno Bertini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05698v1)

**Summary:**

Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth.

## 1. Statistical Analysis of Scientific Metrics in High Energy, Cosmology,   and Astroparticle Physics in Latin America

**Authors:** Manuel Morales-Alvarado, Fernando Quevedo, Mario Ramos-Hamud, Diego Restrepo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05658v1)

**Summary:**

Using data from the widely used open-access digital library INSPIRE-HEP, we provide a detailed assessment of the scientific contributions from the continent over the past 70 years. We provide data for the evolution of the overall productivity in the region relative to the rest of the world. This pioneering analysis, which relies solely on open data, can serve as an essential resource for researchers and policymakers alike. It aims to empower scientists with insights into the significance of their contributions to both regional and global research.

## 2. Topological modes, non-locality and the double copy

**Authors:** William T. Emond, Laura Engelbrecht, Nathan Moynihan, Chris D. White

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05653v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05653v1)

**Summary:**

The double copy connects scattering amplitudes and other objects in gauge and gravity theories. Open conceptual issues include whether non-local information in gravity theories can be generated from the double copy. We show how our conclusions apply to four- and five-point scattering Amplitudes in topological gauge / gravity theories, as a by-product obtaining greatly simplified analytic expressions for the four-point amplitudes. We clarify the role of BCJ shifts in modifying how topological modes contribute. We argue that topological theories (with and without mass) in 2+1 dimensions make a useful playground for exploring non-locality.

## 3. Notes on certain binomial harmonic sums of Sun's type

**Authors:** Yajun Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05599v1)

**Summary:**

We prove and generalize some recent conjectures of Z.-W. Sun on infinite series. We evaluate various classes of infinite sums in closed form by interpreting them as automorphic objects on the moduli spaces for Legendre curves. The summands of these sums involve products of harmonic numbers and several binomial coefficients. We conclude that the sums are all automorphs of positive genera $ g\in\{1,2,3,5$ of positiveGenera.

## 4. Juggling with Tensor Bases in Functional Approaches

**Authors:** Jens Braun, Andreas Geißel, Jan M. Pawlowski, Franz R. Sattler, Nicolas Wink

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05580v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05580v1)

**Summary:**

Systematic expansion schemes in functional approaches require the inclusion of higher order vertices. These vertices are expanded in independent tensor bases with a rapidly increasing number of basis elements. Amongst the related tasks are the construction of bases and projection operators. We present progress in all these directions and introduce the Mathematica package TensorBases designed for the aforementioned tasks. We also discuss the importance ordering of their elements, and the optimisation of such tensor Base elements. We conclude with an analysis of their regularity in momentum space.

## 5. Genus $g$ Virasoro Correlation Functions for Vertex Operator Algebras

**Authors:** Michael P. Tuite, Michael Welby

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05553v1)

**Summary:**

We show the Virasoro $n$-point correlation function on a genus $g$ marked Riemann surface in the Schottky uniformisation. We also describe the modular properties of the VOA under a homology base change. We express the sum of weights over certain graphs where the weights explicitly depend on $c$, the classical bidifferential of the second kind, the projective connection, holomorphic 1-forms and derivatives with respect to any $3g-3$ locally independent period matrix elements.

## 6. Note on surface defects in multiscalar critical models

**Authors:** Andrii Anataichuk, Sabine Harribey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05519v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05519v1)

**Summary:**

This paper studies generic surface defects for multiscalar critical models. The beta functions of the defect couplings are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect Couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. We find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.

## 7. A novel Lagrange-multiplier approach to the effective-one-body dynamics   of binary systems in post-Minkowskian gravity

**Authors:** Thibault Damour, Alessandro Nagar, Andrea Placidi, Piero Rettegno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05487v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05487v1)

**Summary:**

Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the conservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of EOB-PM Hamiltonians. For the first time, an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers EOB/NR unfaithfulness of at most $1\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity catalog up to mass ratio $q=15.

## 8. $\mathrm{O}$/$\mathrm{SO}$ Gauge Groups, $BC$ Quivers and $O3$ Planes

**Authors:** Sam Bennett, Amihay Hanany

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05443v1)

**Summary:**

D3-/D5-/NS5-brane systems with $O3$ orientifold planes realise 3d gauge theories. Such setups have long contained an ambiguity regarding the global form of $D$-type gauge groups. A set of identities are proposed relating the Coulomb branches of generic quivers under a Higgsing. A further prescription is conjectured regarding the action of $DC$-branes on maximal $ DC$-chains. The identities are based on the theory of symplectic quivers.

## 9. Peaks sphericity of non-Gaussian random fields

**Authors:** Cristiano Germani, Mohammad Ali Gorji, Michiru Uwabo-Niibo, Masahide Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05434v1)

**Summary:**

We present a formalism valid regardless of how large the deviation from Gaussian statistics is. We show that the effects of small perturbative non-Gaussianity on the sphericity parameters are negligible, as they are even smaller than the subleading Gaussian corrections. In contrast, we find that large non- Gaussianity can significantly distort the peak configurations, making them much less spherical. The framework applies to any system with a given power spectrum and the corresponding bispectrum in the regime in which contributions from higher-order correlators can be neglected.

## 10. The finite temperature ground state energy of the confining string in   three-dimensional U(1) gauge theory

**Authors:** M. Caselle, A. Mariani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05354v1)

**Summary:**

The three-dimensional U(1) gauge theory displays a peculiar form of confinement which does not fit in the standard paradigm of effective string theory. For small values of the bare coupling, far from the continuum, the results are well-described by the Nambu-Goto string. In an intermediate region, all known theoretical predictions are incompatible with the numerical data. For large bare coupling,. we find remarkable agreement with a formula recently derived by Aharony, Barel and Sheaffer. We find markedly different behavior compared to non-Abelian theories.

## 11. "Glueballs" in the Quantum Mechanics of three large massless Yang-Mills   coupled Matrices

**Authors:** João P. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05304v1)

**Summary:**

We use a loop truncated Jevicki-Sakita effective collective field Hamiltonian to obtain, over a very large range of values of 't Hooft's coupling, the large N (planar) ground state energy. We obtain the bound state masses of "glueballs", their quantum numbers and ensuing degeneracies. This captures the dynamics of the (residual) gauge invariant sector of the spatially reduced 3+1 dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory.

## 12. Chern-Simons Inspired Massive Gravity

**Authors:** J. Chagoya, M. Sabido, A. Silva-García

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05210v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we propose a new 2+1 theory of gravity. We start with a modification of Chern-Simons 2-1 gravity. The second order expansion of this action is equivalent to New Massive Gravity. We explore solutions to the theory and show that it has a BTZ solution with an effective cosmological constant in terms of the parameters of the theory, global Lifshitz space-times and asymptotically flat black holes. We show that the action can be rewritten as a Born-Infeld type action.

## 13. Bridging between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential   inflation

**Authors:** Ok Song An, Jin U Kang, Yong Jin Kim, Ui Ri Mun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05202v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an idea to build a bridge between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation by backtracking the evolution of the inflaton field from the present time to the end of reheating. We find a simple analytic relation between the reheating temperature and the observational parameters for dark energy, and numerically confirm its validity. This relation is universal and can apply to all quint essential inflation models with any reheating mechanism. It also implies that any quintessentialflation model with a successful reheating predicts the equation of state of dark energy today extremely close to $-1.

## 14. Vacuum stress between conducting plates: the curved spacetime version

**Authors:** Borzoo Nazari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05148v1)

**Summary:**

Brown and Maclay found the energy-momentum tensor for the Casimir effect of parallel plates in 1969. We find its curved spacetime version in a static background using the point splitting regularization method. Previous results in the literature are reinforced and some consequences discussed. We also discuss the consequences of our results on the nature of the universe and how they relate to our understanding of it. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for the theory of relativity and quantum gravity.

## 15. Renormalized Quantum Stress-Energy Tensor of a Nonzero Radius Cosmic   String

**Authors:** Noah Graham

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05129v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the effects of quantum fluctuations of a scalar field in the "ballpoint pen" cosmic string geometry. This calculation provides one of the few examples where quantum effects in curved spacetime can be explicitly calculated. The calculation demonstrates in detail the process of renormalization in curved Spacetime, including the effect of the conformal anomaly. We extend the approach to renormalized energy density in two space dimensions to $3+1$ dimensions, nonzero scalar mass, and the full stress-energy tensor.
