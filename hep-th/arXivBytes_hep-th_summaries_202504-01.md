## 0. Modified cosmology though spacetime thermodynamics and generalized   mass-to-horizon entropy

**Authors:** Spyros Basilakos, Andreas Lymperis, Maria Petronikolou, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24355v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach for the case of generalized mass-to-horizon entropy. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector arising from the novel terms. We show that the Universe exhibits the usual thermal history with the succession of matter and dark energy epochs. Finally, we perform observational confrontation with Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets, showing that the scenario is in agreement with observations.

## 1. Universality of Rényi Entropy in Conformal Field Theory

**Authors:** Yuya Kusuki, Hirosi Ooguri, Sridip Pal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24353v1)

**Summary:**

We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy $S_A^{(n)$ behaves as $F$ in $n \rightarrow 0$ limit. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spots idea.

## 2. Cylindrical boundary induced current in the cosmic string spacetime

**Authors:** E. R. Bezerra de Mello, H. F. Santana Mota, W. Oliveira dos Santos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24281v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we investigate the vacuum current associated with a charged bosonic field operator, induced by a cylindrical boundary in the idealized cosmic string spacetime. In order to provide a better understanding of these currents, we provide some graphs exhibiting their behavior as function of the distance to the string's core, and on the intensity of the magnetic flux running along it. Some asymptotic behaviors for the boundary-induced vacuum currents are investigated in various limiting cases. These plots also present how the parameter associated with the planar angle deficit interfere in the corresponding current.

## 3. A possibility for grand unification and non-Higgs mass generation in a   Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like theory of fermions interacting with current metric   field

**Authors:** Sergii Kutnii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24250v1)

**Summary:**

Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like models are studied to address the problem of vector boson masses and nonrenormalizability of the theory. A new NJL-like model: the theory of current metric field interacting with fermions is proposed. Bosonization in this model can produce massless vector bosons under certain conditions which makes it a candidate grand unified theory. Both Higgs and non-Higgs effects can contribute to particle masses. The model can be used to develop a new theory of quantum gravity.

## 4. Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2   $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain

**Authors:** Riccardo Borsato, Miguel García Fernández

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24223v1)

**Summary:**

Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact spin-chain. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model.

## 5. Berry Phase in Non-Perturbative QED

**Authors:** J. Gamboa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24194v1)

**Summary:**

We study QED$_4$ in the adiabatic approximation, incorporating global topological effects associated with the $U(1)$ Berry connection. The partition function decomposes into topological sectors weighted by this geometric phase, analogous to quantum systems on multiply connected spaces. Our results reveal that even in Abelian gauge theory, the infrared regime can exhibit global effects beyond the reach of local or perturbative descriptions. This chiral holonomy induces an emergent vacuum angle that contributes non-perturbatively to the effective action.

## 6. Quantum causality in kappa Minkoswki

**Authors:** Valentine Maris

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24192v1)

**Summary:**

Recent results on causality in noncommutative space-time are reviewed. Investigation of causality provides a quantum constraint, which is a quantum analog of the speed light limits. This later is described by a twisted Lorentzian Spectral Triple build with a twisted set of derivatives. We study, in particular, quantum causal structures in 1+1 dimensional kappa Minkowski space- time. The results are presented in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

## 7. Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic   $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$

**Authors:** Si-wen Li, Xiao-tong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function. The mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data.

## 8. Characteristic initial value problems for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar   field equations in spherical symmetry

**Authors:** Thomas Mädler, Radouane Gannouj, Emanuel Gallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24162v1)

**Summary:**

The characteristic initial boundary problem is discussed in spherical symmetry for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations. It is formulated for an affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a hierarchical system of partial differential equations. As an application, the nonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in null coordinates for a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution for a black hole are derived.

## 9. Dynamics of Spinning Test Body in quadratic Einstein-Cartan Theory and   its Free-fall Test

**Authors:** Kun Hu, Zhiyuan Yu, Taotao Qiu, Zhongkun Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory. We find that the trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\textendash Papapetrou equation. This is due to the coupling of the spin of the test particle to the torsion field of the environment. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical foundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth force.

## 10. A Quantum Energy Inequality for a Non-commutative QFT

**Authors:** Harald Grosse, Albert Much

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24068v1)

**Summary:**

We establish a quantum energy inequality (QEI) for a quantum field theory formulated in a non-commutative spacetime. This inequality provides a fundamental bound on the expectation values of the energy density, ensuring the stability and physical consistency of the theory.

## 11. Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of   mass-deformed type IIB matrix model

**Authors:** Jumpei Gohara, Akifumi Sako

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060v1)

**Summary:**

A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. The mass-deformed IIB matrix model admits classical solutions constructed from the basis of any semisimple Lie algebra. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebraes in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size is infinite. We provide a quantization called ''weak matrix regularization'' on the algebraic variety defined by its Casimir polynomials.

## 12. Note on $q=2$ paraparticle SYK model

**Authors:** Tingfei Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23967v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the $q=2$ SYK model with paraparticles (PSYK$_2$) We analyze its thermodynamics and spectral form factor (SFF) using random matrix theory. The model exhibits self-averaging behavior and shows a striking transition in SFF dynamics. These findings offer new insights into quantum systems with exotic statistics.

## 13. Electromagnetic multipole expansions and the logarithmic soft photon   theorem

**Authors:** Geoffrey Compère, Dima Fontaine, Kevin Nguyen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23937v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23937v1)

**Summary:**

We study the general structure of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of spatial infinity. At leading order, where the effect of long-range Coulombic interactions between charged particles is neglected, we discover infinite sets of antipodal matching relations. Our analysis largely builds upon that of Campiglia and Laddha, although it invalidates the antipodAL matching relation which they originally used in their derivation. We use this to re-derive the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem of Sahoo and Sen.

## 14. $K$-theoretic computation of the Atiyah(-Patodi)-Singer index of lattice   Dirac operators

**Authors:** Shoto Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Mikio Furuta, Shinichiroh Matsuo, Tetsuya Onogi, Satoshi Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23921v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the Wilson Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory can be identified as a mathematical object in $K$-theory and that its associated spectral flow is equal to the index. We examine the Atiyah-Singer index on a flat two-dimensional torus and, for the first time, demonstrate that it can be computed on a lattice. We numerically verify that the $K and $KO$ group formulas reproduce the known index theorems in continuum theory.

## 15. Production of $K^+K^-$ Pairs Through Decay of $φ$ Meson

**Authors:** Xin-Nan Zhu, Xin-Li Sheng, Defu Hou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23919v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a theoretical framework for the production of $K^+K^-$ pairs through the decay of $\phi$ mesons produced from a thermal background. We numerically evaluate the invariant mass spectrum of the $K+K$ pair both in vacuum and at finite temperature. In the NJL model with only chiral condensates, we find that deviations from the unpolarized limit of 1/3 are negligible. The inclusion of the kaon loop results in a finite width of the spectrum, improving agreement with experimental data.

## 16. Hint of $r\simeq 0.01$ after DESI DR2 ?

**Authors:** Hao Wang, Yun-Song Piao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23918v1)

**Summary:**

In the report by BICEP and Keck collaborations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}<0.036$ (95\% C.L.) and $ <1.3\sigma$ non-zero (with pre-DESI BAO data) However, recent datasets have significantly shifted the bestfit values of relevant $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters, and thus possibly alter the amplitude of lensing B-mode spectrum, which would affect the search for $r$.

## 17. Physics case for low-$\sqrt{s}$ QCD studies at FCC-ee

**Authors:** David d'Enterria, Pier Francesco Monni, Peter Skands, Andrii Verbytskyi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23855v1)

**Summary:**

Measurements of hadronic final states in collisions at centre-of-mass (CM) energies below the Z peak can notably extend the FCC-ee physics reach in terms of precision quantum chromodynamics (QCD) studies. Such datasets can be exploited in a variety of precision QCD measurements, including studies of light-, heavy-quark and gluon jet properties, hadronic event shapes, fragmentation functions, and nonperturbative dynamics. This will offer valuable insights into strong interaction physics.

**Authors:** A. Ali, M. Barone, D. Britzger, A. Cooper-Sarkar, J. Ellis, S. Franchoo, A. Giammanco, A. Glazov, H. Jung, D. Käfer, J. List, L. Lönnblad, M. Mangano, N. Raicevic, A. Rostovtsev, M. Schmelling, T. Schücker, A. Tanasijczuk, P. Van Mechelen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23821v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23821v1)

**Summary:**

The European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) - 2026 update is taking place in a turbulent international climate. Many of the norms that have governed relations between states for decades are being broken or challenged. The future progress of science in general, and particle physics in particular, will depend on our ability to maintain peaceful international scientific collaboration in the face of political pressures. We plead that the ESPP 2026. update acknowledge explicitly the importance of peaceful international. scientific collaboration, not only for the progress of. science, but also as a precious bridge between geopolitical blocs.

## 19. Two approaches to the holomorphic modular bootstrap

**Authors:** Suresh Govindarajan, Jagannath Santara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23761v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23761v1)

**Summary:**

The holomorphic bootstrap attempts to classify rational conformal field theories. The straight ahead approach is hard to implement when the number of characters become large. We combine all characters of an RCFT to form a vector valued modular form with multiplier. The method is illustrated with examples with up to six characters. It provides a new approach to the holomorphic modular bootstrap. It is based on the theory of vectors valued modular forms, given a known RCFT, we obtain new vector valued modules.

## 20. Classification of Modular Symmetries in Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic   String theories

**Authors:** Shuta Funakoshi, Yuichi Koga, Hajime Otsuka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23741v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23741v1)

**Summary:**

We study modular symmetries in non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories. We focus on a subgroup of the T-duality group $O(D+16,D,\mathbb{Z})$ on toroidal backgrounds. It turns out that the gauge symmetry is maximally enhanced at fixed points of modular symmetry on $T^2$ on which we analyze the vacuum structure of eight-dimensional tachyon-free vacua. We classify the modular symmetry and a $CP$-like symmetry on the orbifolds.

## 21. On an approach to canonicalizing elliptic Feynman integrals

**Authors:** Jiaqi Chen, Li Lin Yang, Yiyang Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720v1)

**Summary:**

We present a systematic method for the construction of canonical bases for univariate elliptic Feynman integrals with multiple kinematic scales. The construction is performed in the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves. The bases constructed in the normal form can be mapped to generic integral families via an appropriate M\"obius transformation. We discuss the application of our method to several concrete examples, where we show that the $\varepsilon$-factorization of sub-sector dependence can also be simply done.

## 22. Derivative expansion in a two-scalar field theory

**Authors:** Alícia G. Borges, Ilya L. Shapiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23694v1)

**Summary:**

The coefficient of the derivative term is calculated up to the first order in curvature in the one-scalar theory. The method can be applied to a larger number of scalars. In the theory with strong hierarchy of masses, the renormalized effective potential and the coefficients of the second-order derivative terms demonstrate the quantum decoupling in the low-energy limit. It can be used to solve the problem of how to deal with two interacting real scalar fields in curved spacetime.
