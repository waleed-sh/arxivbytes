## 0. Unitarity and Lorentz in variance in QCD for a variety of gauges

**Authors:** A. Andrasi, J. C. Taylor

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10315v1)

**Summary:**

We generalise the Kugo and Ojima formalism for the structure of state space in gauge theories. (i) We allow for a more general class of gauge-fixing including non-covariant cases. (ii) We display the two possible Hamiltonians allowed by the KO action. (iii) We give manifestly Lorentz invariant forms of KO, showing that they are not unique. (iv) We analyse theructure of Fock space, proving that the allowed states span exactly half of it (leaving aside pure transverse states).

## 1. Asymptotic safety meets tensor field theory: towards a new class of   gravity-matter systems

**Authors:** Astrid Eichhorn, Razvan Gurau, Zois Gyftopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10307v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum fluctuations of gravity generically screen the quartic couplings in (multi-)scalar models. For a tensor field theory in which the scalar field transforms under an internal $O(N)^3$ symmetry, this has the effect of replacing asymptotic freedom, recently discovered at large $N$ on a fixed flat background. The fixed point originates from the competition between the effects of the matter self-interactions which, contrary to the usual scalar models, are antiscreening.

## 2. Near-Boundary Asymptotics and Unique Continuation for the   AdS--Einstein--Maxwell System

**Authors:** Simon Guisset

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10298v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we extend the results of both Shao and Holzegel-Shao to the AdS-Einstein-Maxwell system. We study the asymptotics of the metric $g$ and the Maxwell field $F$ for the fully nonlinear coupled system. Furthermore, we characterise the holographic (boundary) data used in the second part of this work. We also prove the local unique continuation property for solutions of the coupled Einstein equations from the conformal boundary.

## 3. The complex Liouville string: the gravitational path integral

**Authors:** Scott Collier, Lorenz Eberhardt, Beatrix Mühlmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10265v1)

**Summary:**

We give a rigorous definition of sine dilaton gravity in terms of the worldsheet theory of the complex Liouville string arXiv:2409.17246. We uncover that the gravitational path integral receives contributions from new saddles describing transitions between vacua in a third-quantized picture. We also discuss the sphere and disk partition function in this context and contrast our findings with other recent work on this theory. The paper is published by the Royal Society of London and is available on their website.

## 5. Rotating spacetimes with a free scalar field in four and five dimensions

**Authors:** José Barrientos, Christos Charmousis, Adolfo Cisterna, Mokhtar Hassaine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10223v1)

**Summary:**

We construct explicit rotating solutions in Einstein's theory of relativity with a minimally coupled free scalar field. We find solutions in four or five spacetime dimensions. These spacetimes describe, in particular, the back-reaction of a free scaler field evolving in a Kerr spacetime. In the static limit, these five-dimensional geometries provide higher-dimensional extensions of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, we say. We offer a comprehensive analysis of several recently proposed four-dimensional static solutions with scalar multipolar hair.

## 6. Gravitational solitons and non-relativistic string theory

**Authors:** Troels Harmark, Johannes Lahnsteiner, Niels A. Obers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10178v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10178v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the non-relativistic string theory (NRST) limit of type II string theory and its action on gravitational solitons. We show that the NRST limit is T-dual to a discrete lightcone limit and can be viewed as a near-BPS limit. This also clarifies the nature of multi-string states of NRST and its connection to matrix string theory. Finally, we show that a further decoupling limit leads to new holographic correspondences between multicritical matrix theories and NRST in curved TSNC backgrounds.

## 7. Invariant Theory and Magic State Distillation

**Authors:** Amolak Ratan Kalra, Shiroman Prakash

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10163v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the performance of a linear self-orthogonal $GF(4)$ code for magic state distillation of Bravyi and Kitaev's $|T\rangle$-state is characterized by its simple weight enumerator. We compute weight enumerators of all such codes with less than 20 qubits and find none whose threshold exceeds that of the 5-qubit code. We also obtain new non-negativity constraints by demanding consistency of the associated magic stateDistillation routine.

## 8. Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in   Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter

**Authors:** Jia-xiang Liang, Peng Xu, Ming-hui Du, Zi-ren Luo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. We analyze the abundance and mass range of PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition. The mass range falls within the only allowed ``asteroid mass'' window from current joint observations, and their abundance constitutes approximately 20\% of the total mass and energy of the universe. These findings strongly suggest that PBH's produced by. the turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark. matter.

## 9. Gluon skewed generalized parton distributions of proton from a   light-front Hamiltonian approach

**Authors:** Pengxiang Zhang, Yiping Liu, Siqi Xu, Chandan Mondal, Xingbo Zhao, James P. Vary

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10119v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate all leading-twist gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) inside the proton at nonzero skewness using the basis light-front quantization framework. The GPDs in $\sigma$-space exhibit diffraction patterns, reminiscent of optical wave diffraction. The results show that the qualitative behaviors of the G PDs are consistent with those from other theoretical calculations. We analyze the GPD’s in the boost-invariant longitudinal coordinate, which serves as the Fourier conjugate of the Skewness.

## 10. A state sum for four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum geometry in terms of   edge vectors

**Authors:** Roukaya Dekhil, Matteo Laudonio, Daniele Oriti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115v1)

**Summary:**

We present the construction of a new state sum model for $4d$ Lorentzian quantum gravity. It is based on the description of quantum simplicial geometry in terms of edge vectors. We also show how the new model connects to the LorentZian Barrett-Crane spin foam model, formulated in terms. of quantized triangle bivectors. Back to Mail Online home.back to the page you came from.

## 11. Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to   thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections

**Authors:** Qing-Quan Zeng, Xi He, Zhao-Huan Yu, Jiaming Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate symmetry in a scalar field. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments. We present our results in a paper published in the journal The Astrophysics of Gravitational Wave Theory and Theory (ASW) Volume 2, pages 1-3.

## 12. Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar

**Authors:** Ok Song An, Jin U Kang, Yong Jin Kim, Ui Ri Mun, Un Gyong Ri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observed observations.

## 13. Quantum field theory on curved manifolds

**Authors:** Tomohiro Matsuda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09919v1)

**Summary:**

Given a manifold of a system with internal degrees of freedom, the curvature is defined for the manifold. If one defines the local vacuum in the tangent space of the manifold, one can define a local mapping in the vicinity of the contact point, which is nothing but the Bogoliubov transformation. The curvature of the electromagnetic field gives the Schwinger effect, and the curvatures of the base space introduces the local Unruh effect, which realizes Hawking radiation if applied on the Black hole horizon.

## 14. Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond   field

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi, Ali Övgün

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat. We perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge.

## 15. Holographic Bound of Casimir Effect in General Dimensions

**Authors:** Rong-Xin Miao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09886v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein gravity, DGP gravity, and Gauss-Bonnet gravity sets a universal lower bound of the strip Casimir effect in general dimensions. We verify the holographic bound by free theories and $O(N)$ models in the $\epsilon$ expansions. It implies holography sets a lower bound for general boundary shapes, not limited to the strip. Finally, we briefly comment on the impact of mass and various generalizations and applications of our results. The paper generalizes the discussions to higher dimensions.
