## 0. SymTFT construction of gapless exotic-foliated dual models

**Authors:** Fabio Apruzzi, Francesco Bedogna, Salvo Mancani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11449v1)

**Summary:**

We construct Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) for continuous subsystem symmetries, which are inherently non-Lorentz-invariant. In analogy with the sandwich construction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. We obtain the foliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ cube, and $\phi$ theories. This also captures self-duality symmetry as condensation defects.

## 1. Ghostly interactions in (1+1) dimensional classical field theory

**Authors:** Cédric Deffayet, Aaron Held, Shinji Mukohyama, Alexander Vikman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11437v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the classical stability of two coupled scalar fields with opposite-sign kinetic terms evolving in 1+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In the first part, we characterise unquenched ghostly interactions and present numerical solutions that support the following statements. We demonstrate that heavy high-frequency ghost fields seem to not violate the decoupling theorem and can be integrated out classically. And we demonstrate how self-interactions can quench the instability, for instance, by postponing its onset to parametrically large times.

## 2. The 2D Lorentz-violating fermionic Casimir effect under thermal   conditions

**Authors:** K. E. L. de Farias, M. A. Anacleto, Iver Brevik, F. A. Brito, E. Passos, Amilcar Queiroz, João R. L. Santos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11430v1)

**Summary:**

In the present work, we explore the dimensional projection method applied to a fermionic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) theory with the CPT-even dimension-six extension. For each thermal observable, the influence of the LIV correction term is considered in the analysis of both low- and high-temperature regimes. The Matsubara formalism is applied to derive closed expressions for the influence. of temperature on the physical observables: Casimir energy, Casimir force, and entropy associated with the system.

## 3. Gravitational waves in massive Horndeski theory with a cosmological   constant

**Authors:** Hatice Özer, Özgür Delice

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11378v1)

**Summary:**

We study gravitational waves in a de-Sitter background in linearized Horndeski theory. This background can be obtained in different ways in this theory. The scalar field has long range whereas its potential can induce a mass term, rendering its range to short distances. The minimum of the scalar potential term mimics a cosmological constant and leads to separate redshifts in the effective frequency and wave number, which also discriminates the tensorial and massive scalar waves. We discuss properties of the gravitational waves, their propagation and interaction with the medium in which they propagate.

## 4. $27 \otimes 27$

**Authors:** Florian Cougoulic, Stéphane Peigné

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11362v1)

**Summary:**

We study the decomposition into $SU(N)$ irreducible representations (irreps) of the tensor product $27 \otimes 27$ We explicitly construct all Hermitian projectors on these irreps, as well as transition operators between them. This yields an explicit basis of the complete $27\otime 27$ color space in terms of orthogonal multiplets. This study shows that even complex color structures can be addressed, with the help of the birdtrack pictorial technique.

## 5. From Symmetry to Supersymmetry to Supergravity

**Authors:** Elena Castellani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11311v1)

**Summary:**

The theoretical developments that led to supersymmetry, first global and then local, over roughly six years (1970-1976) arose from a convergence of physical insights and mathematical methods stemming from diverse, and sometimes independent, research directions. This contribution aims to illustrate the interplay of ideas, methods, and motivations that informed the entire process and concludes with a reflection on the scientific modality of these developments. It also aims to highlight the importance of the role of quantum theory in the understanding of the universe.

## 6. $QQ$-systems and tropical geometry

**Authors:** Rahul Singh, Anton M. Zeitlin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11260v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the system of polynomial equations, known as $QQ$-systems. They are closely related to the so-called Bethe ansatz equations of the XXZ spin chain. We use the methods of tropical geometry to solve the equations. The results are published in the open-access journal, Theoretical and Applied Physics.

## 7. Large deformations of Tr($Φ^3$) and the world at infinity

**Authors:** Shruti Paranjape, Marcos Skowronek, Marcus Spradlin, Anastasia Volovich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11253v1)

**Summary:**

The amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model can be obtained from those of Tr($\Phi^3$) theory by sending the kinematic (Mandelstam) variables to infinity in a certain direction. The objects that live in this world at infinity retain certain key amplitude-like properties, most notably factorization, and admit descriptions in terms of polytopes. We identify particular $g$- vector shifts that lead at infinity to mixed amplitudes involving two pions and any number of scalars.

## 8. Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation in Z Boson Mass Measurements at   High-Energy Colliders

**Authors:** Juansher Jejelava, Zurab Kepuladze

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11248v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11248v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a minimal extension to the Standard Model by introducing a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) term. This modification alters the Z boson propagator and decay rate, impacting the Drell-Yan process cross-section at high-energy colliders. Our model predicts systematic shifts in weak boson masses at higher collision energies, relevant to past Tevatron and LHC discrepancies. We outline a targeted search strategy for ATLAS and CMS, achieving sensitivity to LIV signatures.

## 9. On deformations of AdS$_3$ solutions, supersymmetry and $G$-structures

**Authors:** Anayeli Ramirez, Salomon Zacarias

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11207v1)

**Summary:**

We construct new families of supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solutions in both massive and massless Type IIA supergravity via deformations to known backgrounds. We identify transitions among SU(3), SU(2), and identity structures, and demonstrate the preservation of Killing spinors through explicit spinor bilinear constructions. We investigate D-brane embeddings in the deformed geometries, uncovering stable and supers asymmetric configurations supported by the new backgrounds.

## 10. Can Quasi Periodic Oscillations Encode Traces of Black Hole Phase   Transitions ?

**Authors:** Bidyut Hazarika, Prabwal Phukon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11205v1)

**Summary:**

Findings suggest that black hole phase transitions can be influenced by quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) The presence of distinct phase structures remains evident across all models, which is an encouraging outcome that may be worth exploring further in the context of other black hole systems. The analysis is further extended to other QPO models, including the Warped Disk (WD) and Epicyclic Resonance (ER) models. The results are published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 11. More fields are different: Stochastic view of multi-field inflationary   scenario

**Authors:** Tomo Takahashi, Koki Tokeshi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11158v1)

**Summary:**

High-energy physics often motivates multi-field inflationary scenarios. The noise-induced centrifugal force results in a longer duration of inflation depending on the number of fields, even when the stochastic noises themselves are small. Our results indicate that inflation with an extremely large number of. fields may fail to realise our observable Universe. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of High-energy Physics, published by the journal of the Royal Astronomical Society in London, UK.

## 12. Lorentzian homogeneous Ricci-flat metrics on almost abelian Lie groups

**Authors:** Yuichiro Sato, Takanao Tsuyuki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11077v1)

**Summary:**

We study Lorentzian homogeneous metrics on almost abelian Lie groups of dimensions larger than three. In particular, we generalize the four-dimensional Petrov solution to arbitrarily higher dimensions. Ricci-flat and non-flat conditions on the Lie algebra are derived. We show that a Lie group whose Lie algebra has a codimension one abelia ideal is an almost-abelian group. We also show that this Lie group has a Lie algebra that has acodimension two.

## 13. Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations

**Authors:** Axel Maas, Simon Plätzer, Felix Pressler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047v1)

**Summary:**

The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes.

## 14. Analytical coordinate time at the second post-Newtonian order

**Authors:** Vittorio De Falco, Marco Gallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029v1)

**Summary:**

We derive the analytical expression of the coordinate time $t$ in terms of the eccentric anomaly $u$ at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. This effort reveals to be extremely useful for application purposes. We need to truncate the aforementioned sum to a certain finite threshold, which strongly depends on the selected parameter values and the accuracy error we would like to achieve. Thanks to our work, this analysis can be easily carried out.

## 15. Non-Minimal RT Coupling and its Impact on Inflationary Evolution in f(R,   T) Gravity

**Authors:** Sohan Kumar Jha, Anisur Rahaman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10876v1)

**Summary:**

We examine inflationary models in the $f(R, T)$ gravity framework. We have a conformal constant and an $RT$-mixing term apart from an R term. The RT- Mixing term introduces non-minimal coupling between gravity and matter. We find the existence of two local maxima of $n_s$ which occur at a negative and a positive value of the coefficient of the RT-Mixing term. We also display the variation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index.

## 16. AdS3 axion wormholes as stable contributions to the Euclidean   gravitational path integral

**Authors:** Andrew Loveridge, Hao-Yu Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10868v1)

**Summary:**

Euclidean Giddings-Strominger axion wormholes are stable in asymptotically flat 4D Minkowski spacetime. This suggests that they should, at least naively, be included as contributions in the quantum gravitational path integral. Such inclusion appears to lead to known wormhole paradoxes, such as the factorization problem. In this paper, we generalize these results to AdS3 spacetime, where the axion is equivalent to a U(1) gauge field.

## 17. Universal thermodynamic topological classes of three-dimensional BTZ   black holes

**Authors:** Ying Chen, Xiao-Dan Zhu, Di Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10858v1)

**Summary:**

We establish a universal thermodynamic topological classification for three-dimensional static neutral, charged, and rotating BTZ black holes. In the low-temperature limit, all three cases exhibit a thermodynamically stable small black hole state. This reveals a fundamental dichotomy: while angular momentum and electric charge dominate the thermodynamic. topology of four-dimensionalstatic black holes, their effects become negligible in the three- dimensional static BTZ case, highlighting a dimension-driven divergence in black hole thermodynamic behavior.

## 18. On five-dimensional curvature squared supergravity and holography

**Authors:** Gregory Gold, Peng-Ju Hu, Jessica Hutomo, Saurish Khandelwal, Mehmet Ozkan, Yi Pang, Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10856v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we report the recent progress in obtaining new curvature-squared invariants in 5D, N=1 gauged minimal supergravity. We exhibit the structure of various composite multiplets that are pivotal in the construction. We also present the form of the gauged Riemann-Squared and Gauss-Bonnet superinvariants in a dilaton-Weyl multiplet. As a first application, we compute their corrections to holographic central charges and the Euclidean action of supersymmetric charged rotating black holes.

## 19. Gapless Foliated-Exotic Duality

**Authors:** Kantaro Ohmori, Shutaro Shimamura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10835v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10835v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we construct a new foliated quantum field theory equivalent to the exotic $\phi$-theory. This subsystem symmetry has an 't Hooft anomaly, which is captured by a subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phase in one dimension higher. By analyzing both the anomaly inflow structure and the foliated-exotic duality in the SSPT phases, we establish the foliate-exotics duality. These are the first examples of the foliates-ex exhibits in gapless theories.

## 20. Quantum Geometry of the Light Cone: Fock representation and Spectrum of   Radiated Power

**Authors:** Wolfgang Wieland

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10802v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10802v1)

**Summary:**

We identify an auxiliary conformal field theory (CFT), which carries a representation of the constraint algebra of general relativity on a null surface. We study the resulting quantum theory for both bosonic and fermionic representations. A negative central charge implies a non-unitary CFT, which has negative norm states. In this way, we obtain a bound on the radiated power of gravitational waves in the model. This in turn suggests to apply it to an entire null foliation in an asymptotically flat spacetime.
