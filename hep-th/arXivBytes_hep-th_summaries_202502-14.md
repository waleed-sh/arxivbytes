## 0. A unique coupling of the massive spin-2 field to supergravity

**Authors:** Guillaume Bossard, Gabriele Casagrande, Emilian Dudas, Adrien Loty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09599v1)

**Summary:**

Coupling of a massive spin-2 field to undeformed N=1 supergravity in four dimensions is unique, leading to a specific non-minimal coupling to the Riemann tensor. We argue that the resolution of causality and the unitarity bound in the Regge limit require the introduction of infinitely many higher-spin fields similar to Regge trajectories in string theory. We provide an argument in favour of the string lamppost principle with minimal supersymmetry in four dimension.

## 1. Cosmological phase transitions from the functional measure

**Authors:** Bruno Berganholi, Gláuber C. Dorsch, Iberê Kuntz, Beatriz M. D. Sena, Giovanna F. do Valle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09593v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09593v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate how competitive gravitational wave detectors can be to current and near-future colliders. We study a model where an additional logarithmic term arises in the scalar potential due to a non-trivial path integral measure. This new term alters the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions and could lead to potentially detectable gravitational waves from the early Universe. Our results confirm the expectation that the intensity of such spectrum is highly correlated to the Scalar field's self-coupling. gravitational wave experiments could therefore be used to probe these couplings.

## 2. Explainable AI-assisted Optimization for Feynman Integral Reduction

**Authors:** Zhuo-Yang Song, Tong-Zhi Yang, Qing-Hong Cao, Ming-xing Luo, Hua Xing Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09544v1)

**Summary:**

We present a novel approach to optimizing the reduction of Feynman integrals using integration-by-parts identities. By developing a priority function through the FunSearch algorithm, we achieve significant improvements in memory usage and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. This work provides a powerful and interpretable framework for optimizing IBP reductions, paving the way for more efficient and practical calculations in high-energy physics. We observed an improvement by a factor of 3058 compared totraditional methods for reductions of certain Feyn man integrals with many dots and numerators.

## 3. Neutrino Masses and Phenomenology in Nnaturalness

**Authors:** Manuel Ettengruber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09538v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, it is shown that $N$naturalness scenarios have an intrinsic mechanism to suppress neutrino masses. The resulting phenomenology of such a tower is investigated. This opens the door for terrestrial tests of $N $naturalness whose phenomenology was so far focused on Cosmology. The unique signals in neutrinos oscillation experiments, neutrini mass measurements, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are discussed. The results are presented in the form of a theoretical framework.

## 4. Non-Perturbative Hamiltonian and Higher Loop Corrections in USR   Inflation

**Authors:** Hassan Firouzjahi, Bahar Nikbakht

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09481v1)

**Summary:**

The Hamiltonian for the curvature perturbations and the Goldstone field is presented. It is shown that the loop corrections on long CMB scales increase rapidly with the number of loop $L$ and the setup will go out of perturbative control at the four-loop level. We calculate the higher order loop corrections in USR models which are employed for PBHs formation. We employ the formalism of EFT of inflation in models of single field ultra slow-roll inflation and obtain a non-perturbative result for the Hamiltonian.

## 5. Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide   Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3

**Authors:** Kyu-Hyun Chae

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373v1)

**Summary:**

Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly test or measure weak gravity for Newtonian acceleration. New method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10-11.0.

## 6. Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic   censorship and Hoop conjecture

**Authors:** Nitesh Jaiswal, S. Shankaranarayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions.

## 7. Emergent large flavor mixing from canonical and inverse seesaws?

**Authors:** Zhi-zhong Xing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09286v1)

**Summary:**

The canonical seesaw mechanism provides a most natural qualitative interpretation of tiny masses for the three active neutrinos. But it offers no explanation for their large flavor mixing effects. The latter can be regarded as an emergent consequence of this mechanism, in which case we are left with an intriguing cross seesaw framework in the mass basis of all the six Majorana neutrino. A comparison between the approximate seesaw relations in the flavor basis and those exact ones in theMass basis is also made.

## 8. Relating electrodynamics and gravity in two Euclidean dimensions

**Authors:** Thales F. Bittencourt, Rodrigo F. Sobreiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09272v1)

**Summary:**

Two-dimensional electrodynamics coupled to Dirac fermions is mapped onto two-dimensional gravity in the first-order formalism. However, the resulting fermion-gravity coupling deviates from the conventional form, explicitly violating parity and time-reversal symmetries. The findings demonstrate that quantum electrodynamicics and quantum gravity remain equivalent at the quantum level. The study was published in the journal Physical Review Letters.

## 9. Oscillons from $Q$-balls

**Authors:** F. Blaschke, T. Romańczukiewicz, K. Sławińska, A. Wereszczyński

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136v1)

**Summary:**

Using Renormalization Group Theory we show that oscillons in (1+1)-dimensions can be obtained, at the leading nonlinear order, from $Q$-balls of universal complex field theories. This allows us to generalize the usual perturbative expansion by Fodor et. al. beyond the simplest unmodulated oscillon case. We explain the characteristic amplitude modulations of excited oscillons as an effect of formation of a two-Q-ball (two-oscillon) bound state.

## 10. Numerical evidence for a CP broken deconfined phase at $θ=π$ in   4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory through simulations at imaginary $θ$

**Authors:** Mitsuaki Hirasawa, Masazumi Honda, Akira Matsumoto, Jun Nishimura, Atis Yosprakob

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09115v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the possibility of the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills. We obtain the critical temperature of the CP restoration and that of deconfinement at $\theta=\pi$ by analytic continuation, which leads to the above conclusion. We avoid the severe sign problem by performing simulations at imaginary \(\theta$. We conclude that the CP symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken at low temperature and it gets restored above the deconfining temperature at $\theta$

## 11. On Zero Energy States in SUSY Quantum Mechanics on Manifolds

**Authors:** Ivan G. Avramidi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09040v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09040v1)

**Summary:**

We study the zero modes of the operator $H_f=D^*_fD_f$ acting on the spinor bundle over a closed even dimensional Riemannian manifold $M. We obtain sufficient conditions on the deformation function that guarantee the positivity of the operators. We also show that these conditions are not necessary and provide an explicit counterexample of a zero mode of $H-f$ We conclude by showing that $D-f' is a Dirac type operator with zero modes.

## 12. Equatorial periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms in a black hole   free of Cauchy horizon

**Authors:** Chao-Hui Wang, Xiang-Cheng Meng, Yu-Peng Zhang, Tao Zhu, Shao-Wen Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08994v1)

**Summary:**

A stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole without Cauchy horizons. The results show that, for a fixed rational number, the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit increase with the hair parameter. The phase of the gravitational waves imposes constraints on the parameters of the black hole solutions. As the system evolves, the phase shift of the waveforms becomes increasingly significant, with cumulative deviations becoming more pronounced over time. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole background, the waveform phase will advance for the central black hole.

## 13. Gauss-Bonnet-induced symmetry breaking/restoration during inflation

**Authors:** Yermek Aldabergenov, Daulet Berkimbayev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08986v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08986v1)

**Summary:**

S symmetry breaking or restoration can occur in the middle of inflation due to the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet term to a charged scalar. This can lead to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry, or to its restoration, if it is initially broken. We show the conditions under which the backreaction of the coupling on the inflationary background is negligible, such that the predictions of a given inflationary model are unaffected by the symmetry breaking/restoration process.

## 14. A First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third   Post-Minkowskian Order

**Authors:** Dogan Akpinar, Fernando Febres Cordero, Manfred Kraus, Alexander Smirnov, Mao Zeng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and Radiation-re reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity.

## 15. The Nature of Phantom Dark Energy and its Relation to Time Crystals

**Authors:** Laura Mersini-Houghton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08894v1)

**Summary:**

Phantom dark energy is a fluid made up of time crystals that permeate the fabric of space-time. In turn, any well-behaved stable theory of a non-canonical scalar field that acts as phantom dark energy also leads to the production of time crystal. This relation offers a new way of thinking and a deeper insight into the nature of the most inexplicable of all ingredients in the universe, dark energy.

## 16. Dark Energy from Time Crystals

**Authors:** Laura Mersini-Houghton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08887v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we analyze a scalar field model which gives rise to stable bound states in field space characterized by nonzero motion that breaks the underlying time translation symmetry of its Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that an ideal fluid made up of these time crystals behaves as phantom dark energy characterized by an equation of state $w \le -1$ and nonnegative energy density $rho \ge 0$. We also show that the speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2} > 0$ is a sign of a stable fluid.

## 17. Notes on conformal integrals: Coulomb branch amplitudes, magic   identities and bootstrap

**Authors:** Song He, Xuhang Jiang, Jiahao Liu, Yao-Qi Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08871v1)

**Summary:**

We study multi-loop conformal integrals for four-point correlators of planar super-Yang-Mills theory. We summarize all-loop predictions for the integrands contributing to components of Coulomb branch amplitudes, such as next-to-fishnet integrals. We bootstrap the $3$ non-trivial DCI Integrals for 4-loop Coulomb branches. We also compute all leading singularities and a large portion of the pure functions for the $34$ DCI integrals contributing to five-loop amplitudes.
