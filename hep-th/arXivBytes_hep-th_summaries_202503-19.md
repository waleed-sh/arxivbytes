## 0. Relativistic Fractons and their Dust

**Authors:** Qiuyue Liang, Tom Melia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14496v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14496v1)

**Summary:**

Theories have a symmetry current that is proportional to a vector field that spontaneously breaks Lorentz boost symmetry. The existence of a pressureless dust in the early universe could be a consequence of this symmetry. We provide an example of a fractonic scalar field with a quartic self-interaction evolving on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. We show that the interaction gives rise to a separately conserved fluid with equation of state $w=1$. We conclude that the theories have a relativistic version of the global symmetries responsible for restricted mobility of fracton quasiparticles.

## 1. Scalar Field Static Spherically Symmetric Solutions in Teleparallel   $F(T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Alexandre Landry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14465v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14465v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the static radial coordinate-dependent spherically symmetric spacetime in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity for a scalar field source. We compute new non-trivial telepar parallel $F('T') solutions by using a power-law coframe ansatz for each scalar potential case arising from the conservation laws. We apply this formula to find new exact $F'T' solutions for several cases of coframe Ansatz parameter. The new $F's will be relevant for {studying the models close to Born--Infeld and/or scalarized Black Hole (BH) solutions inside theDE)

## 2. Self-Similarity of Loop Amplitudes

**Authors:** Kang-Sin Choi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14330v1)

**Summary:**

We present an amplitude-generating formula in renormalizable quantum field theory. It reflects the self-similarity of loop amplitudes, in which an amplitude can also be a subamplitude of another. Amplitudes are generated by a small number of "irreducible" ones, which may replace tree-level couplings to form more complex amplitudes. We present the formula in the form of a formula for the amplitude of a loop in the theory of quantum fields.

## 3. Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity

**Authors:** Nikolaos Dimakis, Alex Giacomini, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Grigorios Panotopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.

## 4. The infrared-safe Minkowskian Curci-Ferrari model

**Authors:** Santiago Oribe, Marcela Peláez, Urko Reinosa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14291v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the existence of Landau-pole-free renormalization group trajectories in the Minkowskian version of the Curci-Ferrari model. We discuss two possible extensions of the infrared-safe scheme defined in Ref. [Phys. Rev. D, 84, 045018, 2011] The first extension uses real-valued renormalized factors and leads to a flow in the time-like region with a similar structure as the flow in space-like.

## 5. On BRST Lagrangian formulation for massive higher-spin fields in $4D$   Minkowski space

**Authors:** I. L. Buchbinder, S. A. Fedoruk, V. A. Krykhtin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14290v1)

**Summary:**

The theory is considered in four dimensional flat space in terms of spin-tensor fields with two component undotted and dotted indices. The final Lagrangian for massive higher-spin fields is formulated in triplet form. The BRST formulation leads to a system of fields that are clearly subdivided into the basic spin $s$ field, Zinoviev-like auxiliary fields, Singh-Hagen-like Auxiliary fields, and special BRST auxiliary fields. The auxiliary fields can be partially eliminated by gauge fixing and/or using the equations of motion.

## 6. Extrinsic Geometry and Gappable Edges in Rotationally Invariant   Topological Phases

**Authors:** Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14267v1)

**Summary:**

Recent work has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action. We apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetries and open a gap in the edge spectrum.

## 7. Lattice Monte Carlo meets lattice functional Renormalization Group: A   quantitative comparison

**Authors:** Niklas Zorbach, Jan Philipp Klinger, Owe Philipsen, Jens Braun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14149v1)

**Summary:**

Lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the functional Renormalization Group (RG) are powerful approaches that allow for quantitative studies of non-perturbative phenomena. While results from both methods have recently shown remarkable agreement for many observables, an analysis of deviations in certain quantities turns out to be challenging. In the present work, we present a framework for a more direct comparison by formulating the functional RG approach on a finite spacetime lattice. This removes all ambiguities of regularization, finite size and scale fixing procedures in concrete studies.

## 8. The $ππ$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$

**Authors:** Jorge Baeza-Ballesteros, Pilar Hernández, Fernando Romero-López

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978v1)

**Summary:**

We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb. The results show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\ text{c}=3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.

## 9. Semiclassical Rotating AdS Black Holes with Quantum Hair in Holography

**Authors:** Ryusei Hamaki, Kengo Maeda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13840v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of the AdS/CFT duality, we study semiclassical stationary rotating AdS black holes with non-trivial quantum hair in three and five dimensions. We construct these solutions by perturbing the BTZ black hole and the five-dimensional Myers-Perry AdSBlack hole. In the three-dimensional case, the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor diverges along a radial null geodesic as the affine parameter approaches zero at the Cauchy horizon.

## 10. Adinkras & Genomics in Sixteen Color Systems (I)

**Authors:** Jeth Arunseangroj, Jude Bedessem, S. James Gates, Jr., Gabriel Yerger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13797v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate several 16-color supermultiplets and their topology. An Adinkra's topology is known to be equivalent to $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$-quotients of an N-cube. This is revisited with the focus of closing the off-shell problem for the 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Maxwell supermultiplet. We conclude with the conclusion that the supermultiplet problem can be solved using the Maxwell conjecture.
