## 0. Disparity in sound speeds: implications for unitarity and effective   potential in quantum field theory

**Authors:** Dmitry S. Ageev, Yulia A. Ageeva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07794v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07794v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a complete unitarity framework for quantum field theories whose massive scalar excitations propagate at different sound speeds. Starting from first principles we derive the exact partial-wave unitarity condition for $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering with arbitrary masses and velocity hierarchies. Applying the formalism to a renormalizable two-field model we verify the optical theorem at one loop and obtain compact, velocity-dependent perturbative unitarity bounds. Then we compute the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential in the background-field method.

## 1. Emerging (2+1)D electrodynamics and topological instanton in   pseudo-Hermitian two-level systems

**Authors:** Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07791v1)

**Summary:**

We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.

## 2. Effective Field Theory Description of Hawking Radiation

**Authors:** David A. Lowe, Larus Thorlacius

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07722v1)

**Summary:**

A study is made of Hawking radiation from four-dimensional black holes using effective field theory methods. The trace anomaly for the stress tensor in a general curved spacetime background is reproduced using Riegert's action. Imposing physical boundary conditions on an initial Cauchy surface leads to a unique state, analogous to the Unruh state with a vanishing ingoing flux and a finite outgoing flux. In particular, there is no sign of quantum hair arising from this nonlocal effective action.

## 3. Flowing from the Ising Model on the Fuzzy Sphere to the 3D Lee-Yang CFT

**Authors:** Joan Elias Miro, Olivier Delouche

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07655v1)

**Summary:**

We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the FBuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee- Yang CFT and show that the calculations are compatible with the best five-loop expansion estimates.

## 4. On the RG flow of the Newton and cosmological constant

**Authors:** Carlo Branchina, Vincenzo Branchina, Filippo Contino, Riccardo Gandolfo, Arcangelo Pernace

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07628v1)

**Summary:**

In this note we comment on the RG flow of the Newton and cosmological constants. Also in view of some recent claims that would rise some doubts on the validity of our recent work [2,3]. Here we show that the arguments and claims of [1] are seriously flawed and cannot be trusted. We conclude by saying that we believe that the claims made in [1) are not valid and that they cannot be relied on as a basis for further research. We also say that we think that some of the arguments made in this article are flawed and should be dismissed.

## 5. Superstring entanglement at finite temperature and its Hagedorn behavior

**Authors:** Daniel Luiz Nedel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07567v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07567v1)

**Summary:**

In this work it is shown that at finite temperature there is entanglement between the coordinates of the string. Using a real-time approach, theEntanglement entropy for the vacuum state is computed and written in terms of modular functions whose properties are used to study its Hagedorn behavior. In this work, the entropy is calculated using modular functions that are used in the study of the HagedORN behavior of a vacuum state.

## 6. Pinpointing Triple Point of Noncommutative Matrix Model with Curvature

**Authors:** Dragan Prekrat, Benedek Bukor, Juraj Tekel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07563v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07563v1)

**Summary:**

We study a Hermitian matrix model with a quartic potential, modified by a curvature term. This term breaks unitary invariance and gives rise to an effective multitrace matrix model via perturbative expansion. We analyze the resulting action analytically and numerically, focusing on the shift of the triple point and suppression of the noncommutative stripe phase. Our findings, supported by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations, indicate that the curvatures term drives the phase structure toward renormalizable behavior.

## 7. Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions

**Authors:** Antony Valentini, Mira Varma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510v1)

**Summary:**

We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of Born rule presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper. It is hoped that this paper will provide a framework for future research into quantum mechanics.

## 8. A novel nonlocal spin-1/2 theory: classical and quantum aspects

**Authors:** J. R. Nascimento, Gonzalo J. Olmo, A. Yu. Petrov, P. J. Porfírio, Ramires N. da Silva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07483v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel nonlocal spin-1/2 theory in which the form factor depends on the Dirac operator rather than on the d'Alembert operator. We explore some classical and quantum aspects of this new theory. We minimally couple a $U(1)$ gauge field to the nonlocal field theory and explicitly demonstrate that this theory is gauge invariant. We obtain a nonlocal version of the Pauli equation and the impact of the nonlocality in the $g$-factor of massive particles.

## 9. Decoherence of quantum superpositions in near-extremal   Reissner-Nordström black holes with quantum gravity corrections

**Authors:** Ran Li, Zhong-Xiao Man, Jin Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07480v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quantum gravity corrected decoherence of quantum superpositions in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By employing the effective field theory approach, we model the black hole as a quantum system coupled to an external source via a scalar field. We find that in the microcanonical ensemble, where the. black hole energy is fixed, quantum gravity corrections do not modify the deco. rate compared to the semiclassical prediction. However, in the canonical ensemble where the black. hole is in a thermal equilibrium state, quantum gravitational effects significantly enhance the dec.oherence rate.

## 10. Center-vortex semiclassics with non-minimal 't Hooft fluxes on   $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ and center stabilization at large $N$

**Authors:** Yui Hayashi, Yuya Tanizaki, Mithat Ünsal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07467v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the semiclassical description of confinement for $4$d $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory. We construct the self-dual center vortex for non-minimal 't Hooft twists from the Kraan-van Baal-Lee-Lu-Yi (KvBLLY) monopoles. The confinement vacua for $NL\Lambda\ll 1$ can be described by the dilute gas approximation of center vortices. We apply this result to understand the suitable choice of the twist $p$ for center stabilization at large $N$.

## 11. Chern-Simons potentials of higher-dimensional Pontryagin densities

**Authors:** Onur Ayberk Çakmak, Özgür Sarıoğlu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the Chern-Simons potentials given the Pontryagin densities in arbitrary even dimensions. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general and allows for non-metricity. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern Simons potential of thePontryagin density given an arbitrary even dimension.

## 12. Heterotic String Sigma Models: Discrete Light Cone Quantization and Its   Current-Current Deformation

**Authors:** Eric A. Bergshoeff, Kevin T. Grosvenor, Luca Romano, Ziqi Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07458v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a two-dimensional superstring sigma model that defines a self-contained corner of heterotic string theory. This construction generalizes the Gomis-Ooguri formulation of non-relativistic string theory to the heterotic case. We show how the worldsheet theory is consistent with non-Lorentzian supergravity in the target space. We analyze the gauge and gravitational anomalies with respect to the lowest-order quantum corrections in the sigma models.

## 13. Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth   (Einstein frame) case study

**Authors:** Marcin Postolak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmologies in the Einstein frame. We show that a chameleon-like coupling modifies both the expansion history and the growth of structure in a way that remains compatible with current fifth-force searches. A causal Israel--Stewart treatment demonstrates that the same coupling supplies an effective bulk pressure that drives a smooth bounce while respecting quantum energy inequalities. These results establish new links between dark-sector interactions, entropy production, and late-time acceleration while identifying observational windows.

## 14. Iterative Relaxation Method to Obtain Global Transonic Flows around   Compact Objects

**Authors:** Shilpa Sarkar, I. M. Kulikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07397v1)

**Summary:**

Flows around compact objects are necessarily transonic. Due to their dissipative nature, finding of sonic points is not trivial. An interplay between heating and cooling process, along with gravity and centrifugal forces gives rise to multiple sonic points and hence shocks. The proposed methodology successfully generates any class of accretion as well as wind solutions, allowing us to unify the two types of flows. We report here rigorously the mathematical aswell as the computational algorithm needed, to find sonic point(s) and thus obtain global transonic flows.

## 15. Two-point open string amplitude as AdS transition amplitude

**Authors:** Pongwit Srisangyingcharoen, Jongruk Pukdee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07358v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the two-point open string amplitude at tree level and show that, in a t'Hooft-like limit, it takes a form structurally analogous to a boundary-to-boundary transition amplitude of scalar fields in Euclidean AdS space. Starting from the path integral formulation of bosonic string theory on a disk, we evaluate the amplitude using the Green's function under Neumann boundary conditions. In the end, we recast the result as a sum over AdS transition amplitudes between scalar field with different conformal weights.

## 16. Karmarkar-Tolman Embedded Charged Anisotropic Stars in f(R) Gravity

**Authors:** W. U. Rahman, M. Ilyas, Yi Zhong, De-Liang Yao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07296v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07296v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate various anisotropic spherical distributions of charged celestial bodies within the context of f(R) gravity. The properties of specific charged compact objects are analyzed by using the Karmarkar-Tolman spacetime and three distinct gravitational models. The obtained results are useful to enhance our understanding of how modified gravity theories affect the properties of compact astrophysical objects. We explore the influence of anisotropy on the stability and internal structure of the models. Our findings are compared with predictions from general relativity to highlight the effects of f('R') gravity on charged compact stars.

## 17. Enhancement of photon emission rate near QCD critical point

**Authors:** Yukinao Akamatsu, Masayuki Asakawa, Masaru Hongo, Mikhail Stephanov, Ho-Ung Yee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07169v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07169v1)

**Summary:**

We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits a transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate. This reflects the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid. We conclude that the photon spectrum of QCD is a universal photon spectrum. The photon spectrum can be used to predict the future state of the universe.
