## 0. The Classical Super-Phaserotation Infrared Triangle

**Authors:** Sangmin Choi, Alok Laddha, Andrea Puhm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16149v1)

**Summary:**

The universality of the logarithmic soft photon theorem in four dimensions can be traced to an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts as a local phase rotation on matter. Here we extend our earlier results for the charges associated to these superphaserotations to all orders in the coupling. We furthermore generalize the formulae for the associated electromagnetic displacement memory and its tail from particles to scalar matter fields. This completes the classicalsuperphaserotation infrared triangle.

## 1. Quantitative classicality in cosmological interactions during inflation

**Authors:** Yoann L. Launay, Gerasimos I. Rigopoulos, E. Paul S. Shellard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the classical and quantum evolution of inflationary cosmological perturbations from quantum initial conditions. We calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order bispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by the on-shell evolution. The insights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying the validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations in inflation. We also show how stochastic dynamics can emerge as a sufficient approximation to the full quantum evolution.

## 2. The Classical Super-Rotation Infrared Triangle

**Authors:** Sangmin Choi, Alok Laddha, Andrea Puhm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16142v1)

**Summary:**

In four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes the infinite enhancement of translations, extending the Poincar\'e group to the BMS group, is the symmetry underlying Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and the gravitational displacement memory effect. Beyond this leading infrared triangle, loop corrections alter their nature by introducing logarithms in the soft expansion and late time tails to the memory, and this persists in the classical limit. In this work we give the first complete description of an `infrared triangle' where the long-range nature of gravitational interactions is accounted for.

## 3. Borel singularities and Stokes constants of the topological string free   energy on one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds

**Authors:** Simon Douaud, Amir-Kian Kashani-Poor

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16140v1)

**Summary:**

We study the Borel plane of the topological string free energy on all hypergeometric one-parameter Calabi-Yau models close to singular points in moduli space. We find that in models which exhibit massless D-branes at a singular point, the central charge of the D- brane close to the singular point coincides with the location of the leading Borel singularity. We also find that the Donaldson-Thomas invariant associated to the charge, in as far as its value is known, corresponds with the Stokes constant.

## 4. Henneaux-Teitelboim Form of the Generalized Unimodular Gravity Action

**Authors:** Dmitry Nesterov, Ksenia Lyamkina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16139v1)

**Summary:**

We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG) The central feature of this formulation is the consistent incorporation of time reparameterization. This enhances the gauge structure and reveals a spatial nonlocality hidden in the original formulation. We identify a subset of GUMG models for which the alternative formulation preserves manifest locality. We show that the gauge symmetry in the gravitational sector is extended by a functionally incomplete symmetry, as occurs in the unimodularity gravity. We examine the resulting dynamics, emphasizing the effects of spatial non Locality.

## 5. Asymptotic T-duality in three dimensions

**Authors:** Stéphane Detournay, José Figueroa, Alejandro Vilar López

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16136v1)

**Summary:**

In (super)gravity theories, T-duality relates solutions with an exact isometry which can have wildly different asymptotic behaviors. A well-known example is the duality between BTZ black holes and (non-extremal) three-dimensional black strings. Using this dual pair, we show how the knowledge of a phase space which includes one set of solutions can be used to obtain a dual set. On the way, we find a large algebra of symmetries for the black string phase space.

## 6. Full S-matrices and Witten diagrams with (relative) L-infinity algebras

**Authors:** Luigi Alfonsi, Leron Borsten, Hyungrok Kim, Martin Wolf, Charles Alastair Stephen Young

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16106v1)

**Summary:**

The $L_\infty$-algebra approach to scattering amplitudes elegantly describes the nontrivial part of the $S$-matrix but fails to take into account the trivial part. We argue that the trivial contribution should be accounted for by another, complementary $L-Algebra. This construction reproduces Witten diagrams that arise in AdS/CFT including, in particular, the trivial Witten diagram corresponding to CFT two-point functions. We also discuss Chern-Simons theory and Yang-Mills theory on manifolds with boundaries using this approach.

## 7. One-loop corrections to near extremal Kerr thermodynamics from   semiclassical Virasoro blocks

**Authors:** Paolo Arnaudo, Giulio Bonelli, Alessandro Tanzini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16057v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse in detail four-dimensional Kerr black hole and show that in the near-extremal limit a branch of long-lived modes arises. We prove that the contribution of these modes accounts for a correction to the entropy for massless particles of spin $s=1,2$. In the full calculation performed in the exact Kerr background the leading contribution actually is sourced by theNear-horizon region only, and as such has a universal validity for any asymptotic behavior at infinity.

## 8. Functional renormalization of QCD in $1 + 1$ dimensions: four-fermion   interactions from quark-gluon dynamics

**Authors:** Eric Oevermann, Adrian Koenigstein, Stefan Floerchinger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16051v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum Chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions is investigated with the Functional Renormalization Group. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work.

## 9. Generalized Wilson lines and the gravitational scattering of spinning   bodies

**Authors:** Domenico Bonocore, Anna Kulesza, Johannes Pirsch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16049v1)

**Summary:**

A generalization of Wilson line operators at subleading power in the soft expansion has been recently introduced as an efficient building block of gravitational scattering amplitudes for non-spinning objects. Building on the well-studied worldline model with supersymmetry, in this work we extend the generalized Wilson line (GWL) approach to the case of spinning gravitating bodies. At the quantum level we derive from first-principles a representation for the spin $1/2$ GWL that is relevant for the all-order factorization of next-to-soft gravitons.

## 10. Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moiré bilayer graphene

**Authors:** Jan Biedermann, Lukas Janssen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042v1)

**Summary:**

Moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric DiracSemimetal ground state.

## 11. Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D   Integrals

**Authors:** Matthew Reinhard, Zachary Slepian, Jiamin Hou, Alessandro Greco

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037v1)

**Summary:**

Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. We investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field.

## 12. Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw

**Authors:** Jingtao You, Linghao Song, Hong-Jian He, Chengcheng Han

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033v1)

**Summary:**

The neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. The inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right- handed neutrines that respects the shift symmetry. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrini seesaw mechanism. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 13. Fuzzy-Space Engineering

**Authors:** Paul Schreivogl, Riachard Schweiger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16011v1)

**Summary:**

We study the representation of fuzzy surfaces using these techniques. This involves constructing graphs and writing their coordinates and connectivity into matrices. A script generates the three matrices from the graphs. These matrices are then processed in Wolfram Mathematica to calculate the zero modes of the Dirac operator. Our first result shows the quantization of a two-dimensional Trefoil knot. Additional examples illustrate various properties and behaviors of this process. This work contributes to advancing the understanding of visualization aspects in fuzzy geometry.

## 14. Ti and Spi, Carrollian extended boundaries at timelike and spatial   infinity

**Authors:** Jack Borthwick, Maël Chantreau, Yannick Herfray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we provide a definition for a notion of extended boundary at time and space-like infinity. This definition applies to asymptotically flat spacetime in the sense of Ashtekar--Romano and we wish to demonstrate, by example, its pertinence in a number of situations. Ti and Spi are both naturally equipped with (strong) Carrollian geometries which, under mild assumptions, enable to reduce the symmetry group down to the BMS group or to Poincar\'e in the flat case.

## 15. Feynman Integral Reduction without Integration-By-Parts

**Authors:** Ziwen Wang, Li Lin Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15962v1)

**Summary:**

We present an interesting study of Feynman integral reduction that does not employ integration-by-parts identities. We find that the integration contour can take a more general form than that given by the Cheng-Wu theorem. We apply this idea to one-loop integrals, and derive universal reduction formulas that can be used to efficiently reduce any one- loop integral. We expect that this approach can be useful in the reduction of multi-loopintegrals as well. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 16. Effective Metric Description of 2+1 Dimensional Quantum Black Holes

**Authors:** Stefan Hohenegger, Mikolaj Myszkowski, Mattia Damia Paciarini, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960v1)

**Summary:**

We develop an effective metric description of 2+1 dimensional black holes. It describes deviations from the classical Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. The effective metric is constrained by imposing the black hole symmetries and asymptotic classical behavior. We show how to recast the information encoded in a specific model of quantum BTZ known as quBTZ black hole in terms of the effective metric coefficients. This allows us to further derive the general form of the corrected Hawking temperature.

## 17. The QCD moat regime and its real-time properties

**Authors:** Wei-jie Fu, Jan M. Pawlowski, Robert D. Pisarski, Fabian Rennecke, Rui Wen, Shi Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15949v1)

**Summary:**

Dense QCD matter may exhibit crystalline phases. Their existence is reflected in a moat regime, where mesonic correlations feature spatial modulations. This gives rise to a characteristic peak in the spectral function of the pion at nonzero momentum. This peak can be interpreted as a new quasi particle, the moaton. In addition, our framework also allows us to directly test the stability of the homogeneous chiral phase against the formation of an inhomogeneous condensate in QCD. The formation of such a phase is highly unlikely for baryon chemical potentials.

## 18. Entanglement harvesting in quantum superposed spacetime

**Authors:** Anwesha Chakraborty, Lucas Hackl, Magdalena Zych

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15870v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15870v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the phenomenon of entanglement harvesting for a spacetime in quantum superposition. We use two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum scalar field. We find that it reaches its maximum when we condition the final spacetime superposition state to match the initial spacetime state. Our results demonstrate that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance entangler for both twisted and untwisted field. For the twisted field, the parameter region without entanglements exhibits a significant deviation from that observed in classical Minkowski space or a single quotient Minksowski space.

## 19. On the relation between fractional charge and statistics

**Authors:** T. H. Hansson, Rodrigo Arouca, Thomas Klein Kvorning

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes. We also show that the standard relation between fractionsal charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.

## 20. Conductivities and excitations of a holographic flavour brane Weyl   semimetal

**Authors:** Haruki Furukawa, Sacha Ployet, Ronnie Rodgers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15827v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15827v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the electrical conductivities at non-zero frequency in a top-down holographic model of a Weyl semimetal. The conductivities develop peaks and troughs as functions of real frequency at low temperatures and for $m/b$ close to the phase transition. We compute the poles of the conductivities as function of complex frequency, finding poles with small imaginary part at low temperature and close to a phase transition in the model. The model exhibits a first-order phase transition between a Weyler semmetal phase at small $m /b$ and an insulating phase at large $m/.

## 21. Free fall in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity

**Authors:** Nivaldo A. Lemos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15805v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15805v1)

**Summary:**

 modified symmetric teleparallel gravity does not obey the equivalence principle in the sense of Weinberg. In this theory, minimum length geodesics are distinct from autoparallel geodesICS. The structure of the theory makes it inevitable that a freely falling test particle follows a shortest path, a geodesic of the metric. This also has bearing on whether, under appropriate conditions, this theory is fully equivalent to general relativity. The equations that govern the motion of a freely Falling test particle involve the Levi-Civita connection, not some other connection.

## 22. Pure connection formalism and Plebanski's second heavenly equation

**Authors:** Kirill Krasnov, Arthur Lipstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15779v1)

**Summary:**

Plebanski's second heavenly equation reduces the problem of finding a self-dual Einstein metric to solving a non-linear second-order PDE for a single function. We provide a new simple derivation of both versions of the PlebanskiSecond heavenly equation. Our derivation relies on the `pure connection' description of self- dual gravity. Our results also suggest a new interpretation to the kinematic algebra of self.dual Yang-Mills theory. The Lie algebra of (0,1) vector fields on a R4 endowed with a complex structure.

## 23. Heat and work in black hole thermodynamics via holography

**Authors:** Tomohiro Shigemura, Keito Shimizu, Sotaro Sugishita, Daichi Takeda, Takuya Yoda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15697v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15697v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a formulation of black hole thermodynamics that incorporates the notions of heat and work. This formulation relies on holography, but not on energy conditions on the gravity side. We also argue that the second law serves as a necessary criterion for the UV completeness of gravitational theories. We construct a thermodynamic framework for composite black hole systems that encompasses both heat and Work. We then translate the resulting thermodynamics into the AdS gravity language. We conclude that the thermodynamics of holographic CFTs is consistent with quantum theory and the CFT correspondence.

## 24. Non-linear effects on the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background   anisotropies

**Authors:** Alina Mierna, Sabino Matarrese, Nicola Bartolo, Angelo Ricciardone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15654v1)

**Summary:**

The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anis tropies at large scales. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbation are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect.

## 25. Dynamics of the order parameter in symmetry breaking phase transitions

**Authors:** Fumika Suzuki, Wojciech H. Zurek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568v1)

**Summary:**

The formation of topological defects in second-order phase transitions can be investigated by solving partial differential equations. The temporal evolution of the order parameter predicts the essence of the adiabatic-impulse scenario, including the scaling of the freeze-out time. The spatial part of the evolution, in turn, leads to the characteristic size of domains that choose the same broken symmetry. The finding enables the exploration of Kibble-Zurek scaling using ordinary differential equations over a large range of quench timescales.

## 26. Algebras and states in super-JT gravity

**Authors:** Geoff Penington, Edward Witten

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549v1)

**Summary:**

In bosonic JT gravity, minimally coupled to bulk matter, there exists a single, delta-function-normalisable state in each $SL(2,R)$ representation of the matter QFT for any pair of positive energies $E_L, E_R$ at the left and right boundaries. Projecting the algebras of boundary observables onto these zero-energy states leads to a Type II$_1$ von Neumann factor at each boundary that contains a single operator for each supersymmetric matter boundary primary with sufficiently small R-charge.

## 27. Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the   observer-dependence of gravitational entropy

**Authors:** Julian De Vuyst, Stefan Eccles, Philipp A. Hoehn, Josh Kirklin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent, according to the authors. The entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. We also describe anantisemiclassical regime, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy. In this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. The authors conclude that gravitational entropy is a significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy.
