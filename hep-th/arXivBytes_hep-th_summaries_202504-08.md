## 0. Itzykson-Zuber correlators from character expansion

**Authors:** Alexei Morozov, Hasib Sifat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05292v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate the consistency of character expansion for the Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) model in terms of Schur polynomials. The non-symmetrical structure of the correlators led us to derive an ansatz to calculate all the pair correlators. This opens a new way to study arbitrary IZ correlators of any order in character expansion. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 1. Non-local charges from perturbed defects via SymTFT in 2d CFT

**Authors:** Federico Ambrosino, Ingo Runkel, Gérard M. T. Watts

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-Local Conserved charges for perturbation by a primary bulk field with Kac label $M(p,q)$. We find solutions to the commutation conditions also for other bulk perturbings, such as $1,7.

## 2. Measuring Rényi entropy using a projected Loschmidt echo

**Authors:** Yi-Neng Zhou, Robin Löwenberg, Julian Sonner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05237v1)

**Summary:**

We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second R\'enyi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence. Our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms and in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.

## 3. Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole   surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions

**Authors:** Angel Rincon, Sharmanthie Fernando, Grigoris Panotopoulos, Leonardo Balart

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. We have used the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the massive scalar field are varied. The solutions have been summarized in tables and figures for clarity.

## 4. Equivalence Theorems and Double-Copy Structure in Scattering Amplitudes   of Massive Kaluza-Klein States with Matter Interactions

**Authors:** Kezhu Guo, Yanfeng Hang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05199v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in compactified five-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. Focusing on tree-level $2\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theory (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct leading- order amplitudes for physical KK bosons and gravitons.

## 5. Finite density signatures of confining and chiral dynamics in QCD   thermodynamics and fluctuations of conserved charges

**Authors:** Yi Lu, Fei Gao, Yu-xin Liu, Jan M. Pawlowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05099v1)

**Summary:**

The intertwined confinement and chiral dynamics is resolved within functional QCD, aiming for quantitative accuracy at larger densities. The self-consistent resolution of the confining gluonic background is crucial in particular for even the qualitative properties of the cumulants. A welcome by-product of this analysis is the computation of the Polyakov loop potential in finite density QCD. This can be used as input and benchmark for effective theory computations at finite density. It offers novel insights in the dynamics at larger chemical potentials including the regime of the critical end point.

## 6. Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry

**Authors:** Erdal Catak, Mahmut Elbistan, Mustafa Mullahasanoglu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043v1)

**Summary:**

Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for P\"oschl-Teller and Scarf profiles. We obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. We study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which shows the broader applicability of our method.

## 7. The universal crossover from thermodynamics and dynamics of   supercritical RN-AdS black hole

**Authors:** Zi-Qiang Zhao, Zhang-Yu Nie, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995v1)

**Summary:**

Supercritical black holes exist in the region where both temperature and pressure exceed the critical point. The conventional view states that black holes in this regime are indistinguishable between large and small phases. Recent research reveals that the supercritical regime exhibits universal gas-like and liquid-like phase separation, which shed light on the study on the region of RN-AdS black hole in the extended phase space. We calculate the thermodynamic potential and quasinormal modes (QNMs) and identify transition curves between two different states.

## 8. Stellar isotropic model in the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of   general relativity theory

**Authors:** G. G. L. Nashed, Amare Abebe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04890v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR) has gained much interest in the cosmology and astrophysics community. Within this theory, we discuss the method of deriving a stellar isotropic model. We examine our model using different observed values of radii and masses of pulsars, showing that all of them fit in a consistent way. To test the stability of our model, we apply the adiabatic index and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.

## 9. Critical Behaviour in the Single Flavor Thirring Model in 2+1$d$ with   Wilson Kernel Domain Wall Fermions

**Authors:** Simon Hands, Jude Worthy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04881v1)

**Summary:**

We present results of a lattice field theory simulation of the 2+1$d$ Thirring model with $N=1$ fermion flavors, using domain wall fermions. The model exhibits a U(2) symmetry-breaking phase transition with the potential to define a UV-stable renormalisation group fixed point. The novelty is the replacement of the Shamir kernel used in all previous work with the Wilson kernel, improving the action particularly with respect to the $L_s\to\infty$ limit.

## 10. Finite-Temperature Perturbation Theory of Rotating Scalar Fields

**Authors:** Ryo Kuboniwa, Kazuya Mameda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04712v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate the finite-temperature perturbation theory of interacting scalar fields under external rotation. Because of the translational non-invariance in the radial direction, Green's functions are described using the Fourier-Bessel basis, instead of the conventional Fourier basis. We derive the leading order correction to the partition function and the one-loop self-energy, which involve an analytically intractable integral with Bessel functions. The Feynman rules suggest that the zero-tem temperature thermodynamics of the perturbatively interacting theory is unaffected by rotation, similarly to that of the noninteracting theory.

## 11. Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in   Millimeter Wavelength

**Authors:** Razieh Emami, Koushik Chatterjee, Geoffrey C. Bower, Wystan Benbow, Douglas Finkbeiner, Maciek Wielgus, Lars Hernquist, Randall Smith, Grant Tremblay, Matthew Liska, Angelo Ricarte, James F. Steiner, Avery E. Broderick, Saurabh, Jordy Davelaar, Josh Grindlay, Mark Vogelsberger, Chi-Kwan Chan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695v1)

**Summary:**

Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution.

## 12. Covariant quantization of gauge theories with Lagrange multipliers

**Authors:** S. Martins-Filho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04666v1)

**Summary:**

We revisited the equivalence between the second- and first-order formulations of the Yang-Mills (YM) and gravity. For gravity, the path integral was obtained through the Faddeev-Senjanovi\'c procedure. We also studied the coupling to matter. In YM theory, we investigated both minimal and non-minimal couplings. We used a procedure that introduces Lagrange multipliers (LM) This procedure can be easily generalized to gravity and other models.
