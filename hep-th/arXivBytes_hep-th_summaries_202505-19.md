## 0. Exactly solvable many-body dynamics from space-time duality

**Authors:** Bruno Bertini, Pieter W. Claeys, Tomaž Prosen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11489v1)

**Summary:**

Recent years have seen significant advances in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified. They allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. They constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution.

## 1. Higher-spin effects in black hole and neutron star binary dynamics:   worldline supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling

**Authors:** Domenico Bonocore, Anna Kulesza, Johannes Pirsch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11488v1)

**Summary:**

The inclusion of spin effects in the binary dynamics for black hole and neutron stars is crucial for the computation of gravitational wave observables. Worldline supersymmetric models have shown to be particularly efficient at this task up to quadratic order in spin, but progress at higher orders has been hampered by no-go-theorems. In this work we propose a novel approach to overcome this problem by extending the supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by computing an all-order in spin and linear in curvature.

## 2. Area and volume from entangled qubits

**Authors:** Juan M. Romero, Emiliano Montoya-González

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11487v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11487v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper a relation between entangled states and geometry is studied. In particular, the area of 2D parallelogram is obtained from an entangled 4-qubit state. In addition, the vector area of a 3D parallelepiped is derived from entangled 6-qu bit states. It has been provided the quantum circuit in qiskit code for these entangled states. The paper concludes that parallelograms andparallelepipeds serve as fundamental building blocks for more sophisticated geometric structures.

## 3. Lattice models with subsystem/weak non-invertible symmetry-protected   topological order

**Authors:** Yuki Furukawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11419v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a family of lattice models which possess subsystem non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. We show that the interface between them exhibits an exotic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly coming from the symmetry. We also propose 2+1d lattice model which belong to two different weak SPT phases distinguished by a combination of translational symmetry and non- invertible symmetries. We conclude that the symmetry cannot be written as a direct product of an internal symmetry and the lattice translational symmetric symmetry.

## 4. Weakly-Coupled Trace Anomaly Action for Gravity

**Authors:** Gregory Gabadadze, Giorgi Tukhashvili

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11397v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss a local, diff-invariant quantum effective action for gravity. We show how the counter-term leads to a scattering amplitude that is strongly coupled at arbitrarily low energies. Three Appendices summarize quantum effective actions for the scale anomaly in 4D QED, for the axial anomaly in 2DQED, and for the size anomaly in a 2D sigma model. We highlight connections between their local, and seemingly non-local formulations. We conclude by discussing some physical consequences due to the new sector.

## 5. Truly Confining Supersymmetric Gauge Theories

**Authors:** Riku Ishikawa, Hitoshi Murayama, Shota Saito

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11354v1)

**Summary:**

Wilson loops in the fundamental representation are therefore expected to exhibit an area law. In all cases, we identify the condensation of certain ``magnetic'' operators. Many of them have more than three branches, and one with vanishing superpotential, a phenomenon not previously observed. We classify ``truly confining'' (t-confining) supersymmetric gauge theories, in which no center charges can be screened, and Wilson loops are expected to be confining. We call these theories t-confined.

## 6. Features of the Partition Function of a $Λ>0$ Universe

**Authors:** Dionysios Anninos, Chiara Baracco, Samuel Brian, Frederik Denef

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11330v1)

**Summary:**

We consider properties of the gravitational path integral of a four-dimensional gravitational effective field theory. We discuss how a general positive curvature Einstein metric contributes to the theory. Along the way, we discuss Einstein-Maxwell theory and identify an interesting class of closed non-Einstein gravitational instantons. We present exact one-loop results for scalar particles, Maxwell theory, and Einstein gravity about the Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}P^2$. We provide a detailed study for the specific case of the saddle with second largest volume and positive definite tensor eigenspectrum.

## 7. Thermal Static Potential and Pseudo-Scalar Quarkonium Spectral Functions   from 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD

**Authors:** Sajid Ali, Dibyendu Bala, Olaf Kaczmarek, Pavan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11313v1)

**Summary:**

Quarkonia, which are bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark, play a key role in probing the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) The dynamics of quarkonia in the QGP are encoded in their finite-temperature spectral functions. Reconstructing the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator is a well-known ill-posed problem. We address this by smoothly matching contributions from different frequency regions of the spectralfunction, using appropriate physics valid for each region.

## 8. Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric   Momentum Transfer: Tensor Case

**Authors:** Shohini Bhattacharya, Krzysztof Cichy, Martha Constantinou, Andreas Metz, Joshua Miller, Peter Petreczky, Fernanda Steffens

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11288v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11288v1)

**Summary:**

The calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD was traditionally done by calculating matrix elements in the symmetric frame. Recent advancements have significantly reduced computational costs by calculating these matrix elements. We extend this formulation to the four leading-twist quark transversity GPDs. We also present numerical results for zero skewness using an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement.

## 9. Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials (Part II)

**Authors:** Oleg Andreev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11234v1)

**Summary:**

We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. We discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.

## 10. Magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with impurities

**Authors:** D. Bazeia, M. A. Liao, M. A. Marques

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11215v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, BPS models built from the coupling of Yang-Mills-Higgs Lagrangian to impurities are investigated. The nature of this coupling, the ensuing Bogomol'nyi bound and BPS equations, as well as the effect of these impurities in the abelianization that leads to the emergence of a U(1) gauge group is investigated. We introduce a method that can be used to approximate solutions with the use of small perturbations around the Prasad-Sommerfield monopole.

## 11. Electric-Magnetic Duality for Symmetric Tensor Gauge Theories and   Immobile $p$-branes

**Authors:** Ryuki Makino, Shin Sasaki, Kenta Shiozawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11174v1)

**Summary:**

We study electric-magnetic duality in Lorentz invariant symmetric tensor gauge theories. In higher dimensions, the duality does not hold with only the symmetric gauge fields but tensor fields with more complex symmetries come into play. We also discuss the restricted immobility of $p$-branes in the mixed symmetric Gauge theories. As a byproduct, we find that novel self-duality conditions are defined as BPS equations in the four-dimensional Euclidean space.

## 12. Can we distinguish whether black holes have singularities or not through   echoes and light rings?

**Authors:** Xiao-Pin Rao, Hyat Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11073v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11073v1)

**Summary:**

A recent work shows that the curvature singularity of a black hole can vanish at a fine-tuned mass value. This implies that regular black holes could be special states in black hole evolution. We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Bardeen black hole and its singular counterparts under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. The time-domain analysis results suggest that echo signals may emerge in the QNMs of singular black hole states. Furthermore, we investigate the null geodesics of these black holes.

## 13. Upper bound of holographic entanglement entropy combinations

**Authors:** Xin-Xiang Ju, Ya-Wen Sun, Yang Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11059v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the upper bound of a large family of holographic entanglement entropy combinations when fixing $n$ subsystems and fine-tuning one other subsystem. The upper bound configurations and values of these entropy combinations can be derived and classified. In AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, AdS#$_4$/ CFT## and even higher-dimensional holography, one can, in principle, find different formulas of upper bound values.

## 14. Dynamical Stability and Critical Exponents of the Neutral (S-type)   Gubser-Rocha Model with Momentum Dissipation

**Authors:** Shuta Ishigaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11052v1)

**Summary:**

The (S-type) Gubser-Rocha model is a holographic model, which can be derived from the maximal gauged supergravity in four dimensions. With an appropriate choice of the boundary action, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition in the neutral limit. In addition, we find that there is an emergent Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase of the S-type model. The dynamical stability of the model agrees with the thermodynamic stability.

## 15. Towards local and compositional measurements in quantum field theory

**Authors:** Robert Oeckl, Adamantia Zampeli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10968v1)

**Summary:**

A universal framework for the joint measurement of multiple localized observables in quantum field theory satisfying spacetime locality and compositionality is still lacking. We present an approach to the problem that is based on the positive formalism, an axiomatic framework and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We introduce a renormalization scheme for the measurement of quadratic observables that also satisfies compositionality. We discuss relativistic causality, confirming that measurements in our scheme are indeed localized in the spacetime regions where the underlying observables have support.

## 16. Black hole thermodynamics probes the equivalence principle

**Authors:** Ana Alonso-Serrano, Luis J. Garay, Marek Liška

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10934v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10934v1)

**Summary:**

Lanczos-Lovelock gravity violates the strong equivalence principle. General relativity is the only local, diffeomorphism-invariant theory compatible with it. We also show that certain nonlocal expressions for black hole entropy appear to obey the strong equivalence principle but not all of them do. We present a simple theoretical criterion for identifying equivalence violations in black hole thermodynamics. The paper is published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 17. Precise calculation of the EFT likelihood with primordial   non-Gaussianities

**Authors:** Ji-Yuan Ke, Yun Wang, Ping He

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10915v1)

**Summary:**

We perform a precise calculation of the EFT conditional likelihood for large-scale structure (LSS) via the saddle-point expansion method in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) The precision is manifested at two levels: one corresponding to the consideration of higher-order noise terms, and the other to the inclusion of contributions around the saddle points. We demonstrate through detailed calculations that, upon the incorporation of leading-order PNG, both types of extensions introduce irreducible field-dependent contributions to the conditional likelihood. This insight motivates the systematic inclusion of additional effective terms within the forward modeling framework.
