## 0. Diffeomorphism in Closed String Field Theory

**Authors:** Ben Mazel, Charles Wang, Xi Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12290v1)

**Summary:**

Spacetime diffeomorphism in the classical bosonic closed string field theory (SFT) is represented as $L_\infty$ gauge transformations in weakly curved backgrounds. We demonstrate the explicit map between covariant spacetime fields and the string fields in the flat-vertex frame to the leading few orders in perturbation theory. We further consider a Batalin-Vilkovisky system of extended string fields that manifests diffeomorphicism invariance and allows for extending certain perturbative SFT solutions.

## 1. A finite Carrollian critical point

**Authors:** Jordan Cotler, Prateksh Dhivakar, Kristan Jensen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12289v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12289v1)

**Summary:**

We construct examples of renormalizable Carrollian theories with finite effective central charge and non-trivial dynamics. These include critical points that are not scale-invariant but rather exhibit hyperscaling violation. All of our examples are mildly non-Lagrangian, in that they arise from suitable $N\to 0$ limits of Carrollian theory with $N$- component fields. We discuss implications for flat space holography, highlighting challenges in realizing Carrollian duals to gravitational theories.

## 2. Quantum Area Fluctuations from Gravitational Phase Space

**Authors:** Luca Ciambelli, Temple He, Kathryn M. Zurek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12282v1)

**Summary:**

We study the gravitational phase space associated to a stretched horizon within a finite-sized causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional spacetimes. By imposing the Raychaudhuri equation, we obtain its constrained symplectic form using the covariant phase space formalism. We compute the area fluctuations of the causal diamond by taking a Carrollian limit of the stretched horizon in pure Minkowski spacetime. We show that the variance of the area fluctuation is proportional to the area itself.

## 3. Wormholes with Ends of the World

**Authors:** Diandian Wang, Zhencheng Wang, Zixia Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12278v1)

**Summary:**

We study classical wormhole solutions in 3D gravity with end-of-the-world branes, conical defects, kinks, and punctures. These solutions compute statistical averages of an ensemble of boundary conformal field theories. We provide evidence for a correspondence between the gravity theory and the ensemble. In particular, the agreement of $g$-function dependence results from an underlying topological aspect of the on-shell EOW brane action, from which a BCFT analogue of the Schlenker-Witten theorem also follows.

## 4. Rotating Topological Stars

**Authors:** Massimo Bianchi, Giuseppe Dibitetto, Jose F. Morales, Alejandro Ruipérez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12235v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a three-parameter family of smooth and horizonless rotating solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory with Chern-Simons term in five dimensions. We discuss their stringy origin in terms of three-charge brane systems in Type IIB and M-theory. The general solution interpolates smoothly between Kerr and static Topological Star geometries. We show that for specific choices of the parameters and quantized values of the angular momentum the geometry terminates on a smooth five-dimensional cap, and it displays neither ergoregion nor closed timelike curves.

## 5. Barrow and Tsallis entropies after the DESI DR2 BAO data

**Authors:** Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12205v1)

**Summary:**

Modified cosmology based on Barrow entropy arises from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. We use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) to extract constraints on such scenarios. The best-fit value for the Barrow exponent $Delta$ is found to be negative, while the zero value is allowed only in the range of $2\sigma $ for three out of four datasets.

## 6. QCD$_2$ 't Hooft model: 2-flavour mesons spectrum

**Authors:** Aleksandr Artemev, Alexey Litvinov, Pavel Meshcheriakov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12081v1)

**Summary:**

We continue analytical study of the meson mass spectrum in the large-$N_c$ two-dimensional QCD, known as the 't Hooft model. We develop non-perturbative methods to compute spectral sums and systematically derive large-$n$ WKB expansion of the spectrum. We examine the behavior of these results in various asymptotic regimes, including the chiral, heavy quark, and heavy-light limits, and establish a precise coincidence with known analytical and numerical results obtained through alternative approaches.

## 7. Time Advance in PT-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics and Negative Time Delay

**Authors:** Philip D. Mannheim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12068v1)

**Summary:**

In a recent experiment Angulo et. al. have reported a negative time delay in atomic scattering experiments. This could potentially be the time advance expected in PT-symmetric theories as the PT counterpart to time delay, say the researchers. The results are published in the journal Physical Review Letters on Thursday, September 14. For more information on the experiment, visit Angulo and Co.’s website.

## 8. Refining the Understanding of Operator Size Dynamics in Open Quantum   Systems

**Authors:** Haolin Jiang, Pengfei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12056v1)

**Summary:**

Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems two different definitions of operatorSize emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operatorSize dynamics in open quantum system using Brownian SYK models.

## 9. Anatomy of the simplest renormalon

**Authors:** Marcos Marino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12044v1)

**Summary:**

 simplest IR renormalon occurs in the ground state energy of a superrenormalizable model. The model is a scalar $O(N)$ theory in two dimensions with a quartic potential and negative squared mass. The pole mass is purely non-perturbative and its trans-series can be also fully determined at NLO in $1/N$. As expected, it is IR finite in perturbation theory, but it is afflicted as well with an IR renormon singularity and not Borel summable.

## 10. Diverse regular spacetimes using a parametrised density profile

**Authors:** Anjan Kar, Sayan Kar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12042v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the construction of diverse regular spacetimes (black holes and defects) in General Relativity. Our solutions, in the Schwarzschild gauge, include new regular black holes as well as non-singular solutions representing spacetime defects. We also provide possible Lagrangian density constructions for the matter energy-momentum tensors. Finally, we present a model for a stable star (a gravastar) by explicit use of the junction conditions and obtain relevant consequences highlighting its characteristic features.

## 11. Area spectrum and black hole thermodynamics

**Authors:** Arpita Jana, Manjari Dutta, Sunandan Gangopadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12014v1)

**Summary:**

The role of horizon area quantization on black hole thermodynamics is investigated in this article. The coefficient appearing in the quantization of area is fixed by an appeal to the saturated form of the Landauer's principle. The change in mass is then equated to the product of the Hawking temperature and change in entropy of the black hole between two consecutive discrete states. This gives the corrected Hawking temperature. In particular, we apply this technique to the Schwarzschild black hole, the quantum corrected Schwarzschild Black Hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole and the rotating Kerr black hole geometry.

## 12. Comment on Path integral measure and RG equations for gravity

**Authors:** Aaron Held, Benjamin Knorr, Jan M. Pawlowski, Alessia Platania, Manuel Reichert, Frank Saueressig, Marc Schiffer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12006v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12006v1)

**Summary:**

Asymptotic safety is a candidate for a predictive quantum theory of gravity and matter. Recent works challenged this scenario. We show that their arguments fail on a basic level. We also show that they fail to take into account the nature of matter and antimatter. We conclude that the theory of quantum gravity is not a good one for predicting the future of the universe, and that it is unlikely to be predictive of events in the real world in the near future.

## 13. Hawking evaporation and the fate of black holes in loop quantum gravity

**Authors:** Idrus Husin Belfaqih, Martin Bojowald, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Erick I. Duque

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11998v1)

**Summary:**

New framework makes it possible to couple scalar matter to such LQG black holes and derive Hawking radiation. Quantum-geometry effects enter the thermal distribution only through sub-leading corrections in the greybody factors. They do impact energy emission of the black hole and its final state in a crucial way regarding one of the main questions of black-hole evaporation. For the first time, a first-principles derivation, based on a discussion of backreaction, finds evidence that points to the former outcome.

## 14. Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for   Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence

**Authors:** Hing-Tong Cho, Bei-Lok Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11991v1)

**Summary:**

A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum Stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies.

## 15. Spinorial quasilocal mass for spacetimes with negative cosmological   constant

**Authors:** Virinchi Rallabhandi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11971v1)

**Summary:**

A new notion of quasilocal mass is defined for generic, compact, two dimensional, spacelike surfaces in four dimensional spacetimes with negative cosmological constant. This mass is non-negative, equal to the Misner-Sharp mass in spherical symmetry. It has an appropriate form for gravity linearised about AdS and has a limit for large spheres in asymptotically AdS spacetime. The definition is spinorial and based on work for vanishing cosmologically constant by Penrose and Dougan & Mason.

## 16. Revisiting Unimodular Quantum Cosmology

**Authors:** Júlio C. Fabris, Luiz Filipe Guimarães, Nelson Pinto-Neto, Mahamadou Hamani Daouda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11955v1)

**Summary:**

The quantization of unimodular gravity in minisuperspace leads to a time evolution of states generated by the Hamiltonian, as in usual quantum mechanics. The behavior of the scale factor presents a bounce followed by a de Sitter expansion, reproducing the quantum cosmological scenario in General Relativity. The analysis is extended to the Brans-Dicke scalar tensor theory. It is argued that only in this case a non-trivial evolution for the scalar field can be obtained.

## 17. Assessing WGC Compatibility in ModMax Black Holes via Photon Spheres   Analysis and WCCC Validation

**Authors:** Saeed Noori Gashti, Mohammad Ali S. Afshar, Mohammad Reza Alipour, Izzet Sakallı, Behnam Pourhassan, Jafar Sadeghi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11939v1)

**Summary:**

The regime of Hawking radiation and evaporation ultimately drives charged black holes toward super-extremality of the charge parameter. This progression, in turn, lays the groundwork for satisfying the necessary conditions for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) Preliminary studies indicate that black holes such as the Reissner-Nordstr$\"o$m (RN) model, in their initial form, lack the capacity to sustain super- Extremality. If such conditions arise, these black holes transition into naked singularities.

## 18. Note on supersymmetric mechanics with spin-orbit interaction

**Authors:** Sergey Krivonos, Armen Nersessian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11935v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a simple model of two-dimensional N=2 superconformal mechanics. The bosonic part of the Hamiltonian describes a free particle on the cone. The fermionic part necessarily includes the spin-orbit interaction term. We then propose a quaternionic counterpart of this system, which describes the four- dimensional N=4 superconformsal mechanics$D(1,2|\alpha). We demonstrate that it inherits the Galilean symmetry of the initial free-particle system.

## 19. Separate universe in multifield inflation: a phase-space approach

**Authors:** Julien Grain, Hugo Holland

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11929v1)

**Summary:**

The separate-universe approach consists in describing the universe as a collection of homogeneous and isotropic patches. This gives us an effective description of perturbation theory at large scales through phase-space reduction. This approximation is a necessary step in stochastic inflation, an effective theory of coarse-grained, super-Hubble, scalar fields fluctuations. One needs a stochastics inflation description in the context of primordial black hole productions since it needs enhancements of the curvature power spectrum.

## 20. On 5-point conformal block with level 2 degenerate field insertion and   its AGT dual

**Authors:** Hasmik Poghosyan, Rubik Poghossian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11921v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we develop and explore recursive methods to investigate the 2d CFT 5-point conformal block with a level 2 degenerate insertion, as well as its AGT dual. First, we represent the solution of the differential equation as a double series expansion. On the 2-node quiver gauge theory side, this corresponds to the instanton series. We then demonstrate that the expansion coefficients are uniquely determined by a recursion relation. The result can be elegantly expressed in terms of a single hypergeometric function and its derivative.

## 21. Predictions for neutron star mergers from the gauge/gravity duality

**Authors:** Matti Jarvinen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11904v1)

**Summary:**

The gauge/gravity duality, combined with information from lattice QCD, nuclear theory, and perturbative QCD can be used to constrain the equation of state of hot and dense QCD. I discuss an approach based on the holographic V-QCD model, which includes both nuclear and quark matter phases, separated by a first order phase transition. By using this model in state-of-the-art simulations of neutron star binaries, I study the formation of quark Matter during the merger process.

## 22. Coherent States in Classical Field Theory

**Authors:** Abhijeet Joshi, Vivek M. Vyas, Prasanta K. Panigrahi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11887v1)

**Summary:**

Algebraic approach makes use of the Poisson bracket and symmetries of the underlying field theory, in a complete parallel to the quantum construction. The classical phase space picture is found to play a key role in this construction. We illustrate the emergence of classical analogue of coherent state and its generalisation in a purely classical field theoretical setting. Back to Mail Online home. Back into the page you came from.

## 23. Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics

**Authors:** Massimo Giovannini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11807v1)

**Summary:**

The entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation in the space-time curvature. It turns out that the quantum amplification is effective, provided the system is described by a pair of quantum oscillators and an appropriate Hermitian interaction.

## 24. Gaussian states in quantum field theory: Exact representations of   relative phase in superpositions of Gaussian states

**Authors:** Nicholas Funai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11799v1)

**Summary:**

Recent interest in qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime.
