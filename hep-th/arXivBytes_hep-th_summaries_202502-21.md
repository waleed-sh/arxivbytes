## 0. Primordial full bispectra from the general bounce cosmology

**Authors:** Shingo Akama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14850v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14850v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial non-Gaussianities are key quantities to test early universe scenarios. We study the auto- and cross-bispectra originating from the scale-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations in the general bounce model. We find that the differences between the two branches manifest for equilateral and squeezed momentum triangle configurations. By examining perturbativity conditions and considering current observational constraints, we also find a viable parameter space in which both theoretical and observational constraints are satisfied simultaneously.

## 1. Entanglement entropy evolution during gravitational collapse

**Authors:** Alessio Belfiglio, Orlando Luongo, Stefano Mancini, Sebastiano Tomasi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14797v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the dynamics of the ground state entanglement entropy for a discretized scalar field propagating within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse metric. Starting from a well-controlled initial configuration, we follow the system as it evolves toward the formation of a horizon and, eventually, a singularity. Close to the horizon, the entropy can deviate from the simple area law, reflecting the rapid changes in geometry and field configuration. Although the model is idealized, these results provide insights into the generation and scaling ofEntanglement in the presence of realistic, dynamically evolving gravitational fields.

## 2. Meromorphic higher-genus integration kernels via convolution over   homology cycles

**Authors:** Eric D'Hoker, Oliver Schlotterer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14769v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14769v1)

**Summary:**

Polylogarithms on arbitrary higher-genus Riemann surfaces can be constructed from meromorphic integration kernels with at most simple poles. In this work, homotopy-invariant convolution integrals over homology cycles are shown to provide a direct construction of Enriquez kernels solely from holomorphic Abelian differentials and the prime form. The results of this work further strengthen the remarkable parallels with the non-holomorphic modular tensors recently developed in an alternative construction.

## 3. Geometric analysis for the Pontryagin action and boundary terms

**Authors:** Jasel Berra-Montiel, Iñaki de Santos, Alberto Molgado

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14756v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we analyze the Pontryagin model adopting different geometric-covariant approaches. In particular, we focus on the manner in which boundary conditions must be imposed on the background manifold in order to reproduce an unambiguous theory on the boundary. At a Lagrangian level, we describe the symmetries of the theory and construct the Lagrangians. Through the multisymplectic analysis we obtain the covariant momentum map associated with the action of the gauge group on the multimomenta phase-space.

## 4. Purely metric Horndeski theories and spontaneous curvaturization of   black holes

**Authors:** Astrid Eichhorn, Pedro G. S. Fernandes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14717v1)

**Summary:**

We explore purely metric theories of gravity with second-order equations of motion and a single additional, purely gravitational, propagating, scalar degree of freedom. We identify a subclass of these theories in which this scalar causes a phenomenon similar to black-hole scalarization, which we call curvaturization. Around small enough Kerr black holes, the scalar induces a tachyonic instability. This triggers a sudden growth of Ricci curvature and results in a new branch of vacuum black- hole solutions.

## 5. Effective field theory reproducing the MOND phenomenology based on a   non-Abelian Yang-Mills graviphoton

**Authors:** Luc Blanchet, Emeric Seraille

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14686v1)

**Summary:**

Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant. We show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a fundamental violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime.

## 6. Dynamical dark energy with AdS-to-dS and dS-to-dS transitions:   Implications for the $H_0$ tension

**Authors:** Özgür Akarsu, Leandros Perivolaropoulos, Anna Tsikoundoura, A. Emrah Yükselci, Alexander Zhuk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14667v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the dynamics and cosmological implications of dark energy (DE), modeled as a scalar field with a hyperbolic tangent potential. Despite the negative kinetic term, the step-like form of the potential prevents pathologies such as unbounded energy growth, Big Rip, and violations of the WEC. While the phantom field's energy density and pressure remain finite throughout, its EoS exhibits a safe singularity as its energy density smoothly crosses zero. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for the $H_0$ scenario.

## 7. Generalized lattices, conformal manifolds, and symmetries

**Authors:** Shlomo S. Razamat, Michal Shemesh, Aelly Zeltzer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14594v1)

**Summary:**

We consider supersymmetric conformal quantum field theories (SCFTs) with degrees of freedom labeled by lattice data. For example, one can construct such theories by coupling many copies of a single SCFT with exactly marginal deformations. We show that one can interpret certain current non-conservation equations for symmetries broken by the interactions as conservation equations including the lattice directions. We discuss concrete examples of such constructions and comment on their relevance to compactifications of SCFTs.

## 8. The massive BMS character in 3D quantum gravity

**Authors:** T. Mursheed Amith, Alicia Castro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14578v1)

**Summary:**

Asymptotic symmetries provide a natural framework for describing particles in quantum gravity where spacetimes highly fluctuate. Similar techniques have also been applied to systems with boundaries at finite distances. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional quantum gravity on a finite-radius twisted thermal flat background with a conical defect, representing a test point particle. By computing the one-loop partition function in both discrete and continuum geometry settings, we recover the massive BMS$_3$ character. The additional modes, compared to the vacuum case, arise from broken diffeomorphism symmetry.

## 9. Exploring the phase diagram of $SU(2)_4$ strange correlator

**Authors:** Ce Shen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14556v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14556v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the phase diagram of a quantum many-body system constructed via the strange correlator approach. We numerically compute the half-infinite chain entanglement entropy derived from the dominant eigen vector of the transfer matrix. Our results reveal a phase diagram significantly more complex than previously reported, including a gapless phase consistent with a conformal field theory. Critical lines separating distinct phases are identified, with one such line bounding the CFT phase exhibiting a higher central charge $c=2$, indicative of an unconventional critical regime.

## 10. Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves

**Authors:** Or Dobkowski, Barak Trok, Peter Skakunenko, Yonathan Japha, David Groswasser, Maxim Efremov, Chiara Marletto, Ivette Fuentes, Roger Penrose, Vlatko Vedral, Wolfgang P. Schleich, Ron Folman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence. This asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame. In the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase. This is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two different accelerating frames. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the interface between quantum theory and gravity.

## 11. Geometric Aspects of Type IIA Supersymmetric Backgrounds and Heterotic   Anomalies

**Authors:** J. Phillips

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14517v1)

**Summary:**

We construct twisted covariant form hierarchies of (massive) type IIA supergravity for common sector, D-brane and warped product AdS supersymmetric backgrounds. The Killing spinor bilinears satisfy a generalisation of the conformal Killing-Yano equation with respect to the TCFH connections. The interplay between TCFHs and hidden symmetries of probes propagating on these backgrounds is investigated and used to explore the question of whether charges are sufficient to prove the integrability of such probes on this class of backgrounds.

## 12. On JT gravity path integrals and the tunneling process

**Authors:** Hamed Zolfi, Mohsen Alishahiha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14448v1)

**Summary:**

The Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity path integral of the trumpet can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an older black hole to a younger one, accompanied by the emission of a baby universe. This interpretation becomes less straightforward for geometries with higher genus and multiple geodesic boundaries. In this paper, we examine the path integral for these more complex geometry and find that maintaining this interpretation requires accounting for a portion of the moduli space. We conclude that the interpretation of the JT path integral is more complex than previously thought.

## 13. Intrinsic Regularization via Curved Momentum Space: A Geometric Solution   to Divergences in Quantum Field Theory

**Authors:** Daniel Ketels

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14443v1)

**Summary:**

The problem of UV divergences in QFT has long been a fundamental challenge. We propose a novel and self-consistent approach in which UV regularization emerges naturally from the curved geometry of momentum space. This framework is self-sufficient, i.e. requires no external regulators. It retains equations of motion and is fully compatibility with standard field theory. We rigorously construct the measure-theoretic framework and demonstrate its effectiveness by proof of finiteness for key QFT integrals. This work suggests broader applications in spectral geometry, effective field theory and potential extensions to quantum gravity.

## 14. Bootstrapping SU(3) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory

**Authors:** Yuanhong Guo, Zeyu Li, Gang Yang, Guorui Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14421v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the positivity bootstrap approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills (YM) theory. We extend previous studies of large N and SU(2) theories by incorporating multiple-trace Wilson loop operators. Our results exhibit clear convergence and are consistent with known analytic or numerical results. We propose a dimensional-reduction truncation, where Wilson loop operator are effectively restricted to a lower-dimensional subplane, significantly simplifying the computations. Our findings suggest that the positive bootstrap method is broadly applicable to higher-rank gauge theories beyond the single-trace cases.

## 15. Dragging of inertial frames in the composed Kerr-Newman-orbiting-ring   system

**Authors:** Shahar Hod

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14310v1)

**Summary:**

The dragging of inertial frames by an orbiting object implies that the horizon angular velocity of a central black hole is no longer related to its angular-momentum. Using a continuity argument, it has recently been revealed that the composed Kerr-ring system is characterized by the universal (that is, spin-{\it independent}) relation. In the present compact paper we explore the physical phenomenon of dragging of inertia by a ring in the Kerr-Newman-black-hole-orbiting- ring system.

## 16. Fusion rules and structure constants of E-series minimal models

**Authors:** Rongvoram Nivesvivat, Sylvain Ribault

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295v1)

**Summary:**

In the ADE classification of Virasoro minimal models, the E-series is the sparsest. Their central charges are not dense in the half-line $c\in (-\infty,1)$, due to $q=12,18,30$ taking only 3 values. We deduce non-chiral fusion rules, i.e. which 3-point structure constants vanish. We conjecture that structure constants are given by a universal expression built from the double Gamma function.

## 17. Giant gravitons in D$p$-brane holography

**Authors:** Gauri Batra, Henry Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14249v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14249v1)

**Summary:**

We consider half BPS operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) in $p+1$ dimensions. These operators satisfy trace relations that are identical to those discussed in the $p=3$ case. We identify giant graviton solutions in the dual holographic backgrounds. Despite propagating in a non-AdS geometry, we find that the branes feel like they are in AdS. This is closely related to the emergent scaling symmetry present in these boundary theories.

## 18. Coordinate Light-Cone-Ordered Perturbation Theory

**Authors:** Ozan Erdoğan, George Sterman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14230v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14230v1)

**Summary:**

We review the development of light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in coordinate space (C-LCOPT) We observe that this formalism, originally applied to amplitudes, can be extended to cross sections, which are given in terms of closed paths reminiscent of Schwinger-Keldysh formalisms. The role of intermediate states in LCOPT is played in C-LCopT by paths, who are ordered sequences of lines and vertices that connect pairs of external points. Each path denominator of C-LCPOT equals the difference between the separation of the minus coordinates of the beginning and ending points.

**Authors:** Irene Lopez Imaz, German Sborlini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14179v1)

**Summary:**

Unveiling hidden symmetries within Feynman diagrams is crucial for achieving more efficient computations in high-energy physics. Findings shed new light on the deeper structures ofFeynman integrals and pave the way for significantly accelerating their calculation by interrelating different approaches. The findings are published in the open-access journal, Theoretical and Computational Physics.

## 20. Monomer-dimer tensor-network basis for qubit-regularized lattice gauge   theories

**Authors:** Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Rui Xian Siew, Tanmoy Bhattacharya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14175v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14175v1)

**Summary:**

Traditional lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from irreducible representations (irreps) of the gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis enables the construction of new qubit-regularized gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs.
