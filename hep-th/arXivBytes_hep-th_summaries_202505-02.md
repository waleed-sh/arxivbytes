## 0. Simple Holography in General Spacetimes

**Authors:** Raphael Bousso, Elisa Tabor

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695v1)

**Summary:**

The simple or "outermost" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement wedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Given an input wedge $a$ analogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest wedge accessible by a "zigzag," a certain sequence of antinormal light-sheets. So far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in time-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of holographic encoding by tensor networks.

## 1. What is the Hierarchy Problem?

**Authors:** Michael E. Peskin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00694v1)

**Summary:**

Is there a Hierarchy Problem? If so, what, exactly, is the problem? Almost every theorist has a personal answer to these questions. In this article, I give my answers. I will explain that the Hierarchy problem is not a formal problem but rather our ignorance of a crucial physics explanation. Without the solution to this problem, we cannot make progress on the major questions of our field. The explanation of the nature of the Higgs boson is the key to our understanding of physics.

## 2. Strange correlator and string order parameter for non-invertible   symmetry protected topological phases in 1+1d

**Authors:** Da-Chuan Lu, Fu Xu, Yi-Zhuang You

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00673v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum lattice spin models. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We also demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus.

## 3. Only Flat Space is Full BPS in Four Dimensional N=3 and N=4 Supergravity

**Authors:** Abhinava Bhattacharjee, Subramanya Hegde, Bindusar Sahoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00638v1)

**Summary:**

In N=2 Poincare supergravity, three fully supersymmetric solutions exist: Bertotti-Robinson geometry ($AdS_2\times S^2$), flat space and pp wave spacetimes. We work in the superconformal formalism and show that flat space is the only fully supers asymmetric solution in these theories. We discuss the reason behind the richer vacua in N=1 supergravity compared to its N=3 and N=4 cousins.

## 4. Gluon Parts of Gravitational Form Factors and Mass Distribution

**Authors:** Peter C. Tandy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00583v1)

**Summary:**

The model is the Dyson-Schwinger Equations in Rainbow-Ladder truncation. For the parton mass/energy distributions as a function of momentum transfer, we directly calculate matrix elements of the Energy-Momentum Tensor by utilizing its similarity to the momentum fraction moment of GPDs associated with deep inelastic scattering. A variety of gravitational form factors are obtained including the D-term. The model allows one to assess whether the dressing of quarks can, by itself, produce realistic gluon contributions to light-cone momentum fractions.

## 5. An Analytic Zeta Function Ramp at the Black Hole Thouless Time

**Authors:** Pallab Basu, Suman Das, Chethan Krishnan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00528v1)

**Summary:**

Black hole normal modes have intriguing connections to logarithmic spectra. The spectral form factor (SFF) of $E_n = \log n$ is the mod square of the Riemann zeta function (RZF) The $s=1$ pole of RZF can be viewed as due to a Hagedorn transition in this setting. To our knowledge, this is the first black hole-inspired toy model that has a demonstrably $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Thouless time.

## 6. Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory - Gravitational Anyonic   Edge Modes

**Authors:** Thomas G. Mertens, Qi-Feng Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3D gravity to topological entanglement entropy. We propose a minimalFactorization map.

## 7. Can We Probe Spacetime Non-commutativity Through Tidal Deformability of   Compact Objects?

**Authors:** Junting Peng, Yanbo Zhao, Antonino Marciano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the feasibility of detecting non-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We consider NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge theory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. We then compute the NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several different models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction dominates the tidal deformable of a compact object near the black-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars are not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-Commutativity.

## 8. Aganagic's invariant is Khovanov homology

**Authors:** Elise LePage, Vivek Shende

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00327v1)

**Summary:**

Aganagic has predicted that Khovanov homology can be recovered from the braid group action on Fukaya-Seidel categories arising from monodromy in space of potentials. These categories have since been rigorously studied, and shown to contain a certain (combinatorially defined) category. This provides a mathematical verification that Aganagic's proposal gives a symplectic construction of Khovanovsky homology -- with both gradings, and over the integers.   Here we show, by a direct calculation, that the aforementioned containment intertwines said combinatorially defined braidgroup action with the b raid group action arising naturally frommonodromy.

## 9. Shadow and geometric scattering analysis of a new black hole with   magnetic charge

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00280v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain a newly charged black hole with magnetic charge $q$ and coupling constant $mu$ from the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics theory. We perform the shadow and geometric scattering analysis of this black hole. There is the naked singularity (NS) arisen from the magnetic charge extension of the photon spheres for the 3 and 4-branches. In case of $q<1$, shadow radii of the $2$-branch with $\mu$=0.01 and 0.1 are the same as that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, while the 3-NS branch is constrained by the EHT observation.
