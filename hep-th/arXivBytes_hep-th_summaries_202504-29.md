## 0. How Charged Can Neutrinos Be?

**Authors:** Sudip Jana, Michael Klasen, Vishnu P. K

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20044v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate how neutrinos may acquire small electric charges within the Standard Model framework. We demonstrate that minimal scenarios based on flavor-dependent $U(1)_X$ symmetries are incompatible with current neutrino oscillation data. We also discuss the necessary connection between such charges and the Dirac nature of neutRinos. The findings emphasize that constraints on neutRino charges should be evaluated within the specific framework of the $U('X' symmetry) under consideration, rather than assuming a generic approach.

## 1. Exploring two dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant phases with time   reversal symmetry and their transitions with topological operations

**Authors:** Ryan C. Spieler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20021v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20021v1)

**Summary:**

We use various topological operations to systematically study phase transitions between theories with time reversal symmetry in two spacetime dimensions. The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality.

## 2. Stringy KLT Relations on $AdS$

**Authors:** Luis F. Alday, Maria Nocchi, Aurélie Strömholm Sangaré

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19973v1)

**Summary:**

We study the building blocks of open and closed string amplitudes on $AdS$. These are given by two infinite towers of world-sheet integrals generalising the Euler and complex beta functions respectively. We show that the open and close building blocks are related by an $Ad S$ version of the KLT relations. We furthermore show that they are given to open string amplitude by Aomoto-Gelfand hypergeometric functions. We give their closed form expression up to weight four.

## 3. Quantum Gravity Signatures of Gravitons in a Squeezed Coherent State on   Detectors within a Harmonic Trap Potential

**Authors:** Anom Trenggana, Freddy P. Zen, Seramika Ariwahjoedi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19971v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum gravity signatures emerge in a gravitational wave detector placed inside a harmonic potential trap. We compared the transition probabilities of the detector in scenarios where the gravitational wave is quantized versus when it is treated classically. We found that for graviton states such as coherent, squeezed, and squeezed coherent states, quantum gravity signatures can emerge in events that would not be possible when the graviton state is a quantum state with $n_G$ particles, such as graviton annihilation and the increasing energy level by two levels in final state.

## 4. Holographic Consequences of Heterotic String Theory beyond its   Supergravity Approximation

**Authors:** Leon Berdichevsky Acosta, Salman Sajad Wani, Arshid Shabir, Abrar Ahmed Naqash, Imtiyaz Ahmad Bhat, Naveed Ahmad Shah, Hrishikesh Patel, Saif Al-Kuwari, Mir Faizal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19969v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19969v1)

**Summary:**

 Compactifying the ten dimensional theory with these stringy corrections produces an effective action for a scalar field whose higher derivative term is governed by a single coefficient. The higher derivative coupling imported from compactification shifts the Breitenlohner Freedman stability bound by an amount set by the relative strengths of internal flux and curvature, relaxing it in flux dominated vacua and tightening it in curvature dominated ones. In holographic superconductors, stringy Corrections lower the effective bulk mass and raise the critical temperature when flux dominates.

## 5. Log supertranslations at Spatial Infinity

**Authors:** Sharad Mishra, Kinjal Banerjee, Jishnu Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19910v1)

**Summary:**

We show that it is possible to relax certain smoothness requirements of the asymptotic transformations considered previously. This leads to an enhancement of the symmetry group that includes logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity. Our results complement several recent results which confirm the existence of supertranslated spacetimes in the Hamiltonian formalism.

## 6. Cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model

**Authors:** Ali Nezhadsafavi, Levon Pogosian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19830v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19830v1)

**Summary:**

We study cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model, a scalar-tensor theory with a spontaneously broken local $U(1)$ symmetry. Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially attach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the requirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system limits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter, analogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic structure formation.

## 7. Lattice points in polytope boundaries and formal geometric quantization   of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties

**Authors:** Jonathan Weitsman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19775v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter. We give an explicit formula for this polynomic, analogous to the formulas of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomials. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integralpolytope boundaries. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynometric.

## 8. Simplicity of Mellin amplitudes for AdS$_3 \times$S$^3$

**Authors:** F. Aprile, C. Behan, R. S. Pitombo, M. Santagata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19770v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19770v1)

**Summary:**

The spectrum of half-BPS single-particle operators of the D1-D5 system in the supergravity regime is dual to the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein modes of tensor and graviton multiplets. A key insight of our approach is the use of generalized Mellin space, and a decomposition of the correlators into distinct subsectors each one characterized by different on-shell constraints. The resulting Mellin amplitudes involve a small set of building blocks with manifest properties under a six-dimensional symmetry.

## 9. Impossibility via W states and feasibility via W-like states for perfect   quantum teleportation

**Authors:** Sora Kobayashi, Kei-Ichi Kondo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19747v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the two-party perfect quantum teleportation of an unknown 1-qubit state. We give an impossibility proof that the W state cannot be used as the sharing state. This is in sharp contrast with the GHZ state which is well known to realize the perfect quantum transportation. We also give a procedure of obtaining a modified entangled state which we call the W-like state to achieve the perfectQuantumTransportation under a prescribed measurement basis. We conclude with the conclusion that this procedure can only be used to transmit arbitrary 1- qubits.

## 10. Timelike entanglement entropy with gravitational anomalies

**Authors:** Chong-Sun Chu, Himanshu Parihar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19694v1)

**Summary:**

We study the timelike entanglement entropy (TEE) in two dimensional conformal field theories (CFT) with gravitational anomalies. We find that, unlike the real part, the imaginary part of the TEE displays an asymmetric dependence on the central charges of the left and right moving modes. We propose that the dependence on central charges can be used to probe the presence of gravitational anomalies in chiral CFT. Furthermore, we propose a holographic construction to obtain theTimelikeEntanglementEntropy from bulk dual geometries involving topologically massive gravity in AdS$_3$.

## 11. Four-Fermion Deformations on Line Defects in QED$_4$ with Yukawas

**Authors:** Alessandra D'Alise, Giulia Muco, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19686v1)

**Summary:**

The dynamics induced by a Wilson Line of charge $q$ and electron charge $e$ in $QED_4$ is described. We observe that there is a range of the fixed product $e^2 q$ for which four-fermion operators play a dominant role for the dynamics. We uncover the fixed-point dynamics of the theory and analyze their critical behavior. We conclude that the theory can be used as a basis for the development of quantum computer theory in the future.

## 12. A topological quantum field theory for $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons

**Authors:** Rafael Herrera, Sergio A. Holguin Cardona, Alexander Quintero Velez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19403v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a topological quantum field theory based on the moduli space of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons on 8-dimensional manifolds. We then reformulate the theory within the AKSZ formalism, obtaining a Batalin-Vilkovisky action that, after gauge fixing, matches our Mathai-Quillen construction. We also show that the action can be elegantly recast as a Chern-Simons type theory.
