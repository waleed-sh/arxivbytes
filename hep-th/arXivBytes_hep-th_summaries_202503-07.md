## 0. Superradiance of Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin Solitons

**Authors:** GuoDong Zhang, ChengHao Li, QiXin Xie, ShuangYong Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04657v1)

**Summary:**

Rotation in internal space can induce superradiance. We explore this effect in non-topological solitons of the two-field Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the scalars. We derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 1. Euclideanization without Complexification of the Spacetime

**Authors:** Nicole Drew, Venkatraman Gopalan, Martin Bojowald

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04654v1)

**Summary:**

Minkowski spacetime can be mapped by a series of projections in a higher-dimensional spacetime to a Euclidean space. The result allows regularizations and computations of integrals that appear in quantum field theory (QFT) without performing the standard Wick rotation of time to imaginary values. The procedure is also amenable to fields on curved background spacetimes as well as gravitational interactions. In all cases, complex-valued amplitudes of the form $iS/\hbar$ are mapped to real statistical weights.

## 2. A New Proof of the QNEC

**Authors:** Stefan Hollands, Roberto Longo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04651v1)

**Summary:**

We give a simplified proof of the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) Our proof is based on an explicit formula for the shape derivative of the relative entropy, with respect to an entangling cut. It allows bypassing the analytic continuation arguments of a previous proof by Ceyhan and Faulkner. It can be used e.g., for defining entropy current fluctuations. For more information on the QNEC, visit the Quantum Null Energy Condition Wikipedia page and the Quantum Entanglement Wikipedia page.

## 3. Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum

**Authors:** Zhiyu Lu, Théo Simon, Pierre Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a) We find a preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies.

## 4. Monotonicities of Tanaka-Nakayama flows

**Authors:** Ken Kikuchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04587v1)

**Summary:**

We prove conformal and global dimensions monotonically decrease under the infinitely many Tanaka-Nakayama renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models. The flows also satisfy the half-integer condition. We also prove that the flows between the two models satisfy the half-integer condition. We conclude by showing that the conformal and global dimensions of the models decrease under these flows. We call this result the "Virasoro-Rinormalization Group Theory"

## 5. Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with Internal Interactions   based on the SO(10) GUT

**Authors:** Danai Roumelioti, Stelios Stefas, George Zoupanos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04574v1)

**Summary:**

We present a unification scenario of the conformal and fuzzy gravities with the internal interactions, based on the observation that the tangent space of a curved space and the space itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions. The construction is based on enlarging the Tangent space, while it is formulated in a gauge-theoretical way. We present the unification scenario in the form of a model of the universe in the shape of a sphere. We hope that this will help people to understand the nature of our universe in a new way.

## 6. Presymplectic BV-AKSZ for $N=1$ $D=4$ Supergravity

**Authors:** Maxim Grigoriev, Alexander Mamekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach to supersymmetric systems. We construct such a formulation for the $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity by taking as a target space the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the super-Poincar\'e algebra. In particular, we demonstrate that this data encodes a full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system. The analogous considerations apply to supergravity and its uplift to superspace.

## 7. Symmetry Topological Field Theory for Flavor Symmetry

**Authors:** Qiang Jia, Ran Luo, Jiahua Tian, Yi-Nan Wang, Yi Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04546v1)

**Summary:**

The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) associated to a Quantum Field Theory is a $BF$-theory with gauge group $G$. We show that gauging $G$-symmetry with a flat connection yields a theory with global symmetry characterized by exchanging the conjugate variables in the quantization. We construct the extended operators that generate the $G $-flavor symmetry and the $(d-2)$-form of the gauged QFT.

## 8. Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT)   and quantum beats

**Authors:** Daniel Boyanovsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533v1)

**Summary:**

Synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection.

## 9. Unitary Rigid Supersymmetry for the Chiral Graviton and Chiral Gravitino   in de Sitter Spacetime

**Authors:** Atsushi Higuchi, Vasileios A. Letsios

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04515v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04515v1)

**Summary:**

It is commonly believed that a unitary supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) involving graviton and gravitino fields on fixed 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime cannot exist due to known challenges associated with supersymmetry. We contradict this expectation by presenting a new unitary super-symmetric QFT on $dS_{4}$ The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY by closing the commutator between two SUSy transformations on $so(4,2) u(1)$

## 10. Quantum energies of solitons with different topological charges

**Authors:** N. Graham, H. Weigel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04458v1)

**Summary:**

The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone. Because the combination of the quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge Solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound.

## 11. What happens due to the baby universe effect in JT gravity? -- Analysis   of correlation functions and ERB length at late time using three approaches

**Authors:** Masayoshi Sato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04331v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04331v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the correlation function in JT gravity using three approaches. We find that the behaviors of the three results coincide at late times. All exhibit a "ramp'' instead of permanent decay. Overall, our results are consistent with the SFF analysis. For the geometry with one baby universe, we compute the size of the baby universe and find that it is of the same order as the ERB length. This result is consistent with a baby universe emission mechanism claimed by P.Saad.

## 12. Tidal response of regular black holes

**Authors:** Chiara Coviello, Luis Lehner, Vania Vellucci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04287v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate the tidal deformability of regular black holes (RBHs) Employing different phenomenological models, we analyze their response to both test fields and gravitational perturbations. Numerical and analytical methods reveal that RBHs exhibit non-trivial tidal responses, influenced by their regularization parameters and exotic matter distributions. Our findings suggest that RB hs possess distinct, though subtle, tidal signatures, which may serve as observational probes of their internal structure in gravitational wave detections.

## 13. Quantumness and entropic uncertainty for a pair of static Unruh-DeWitt   detectors

**Authors:** Yu-Kun Zhang, Tariq Aziz, Li-Juan Li, Xue-Ke Song, Liu Ye, Dong Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04230v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04230v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate a pair of detectors operating in Minkowski space-time. We analyze the characteristics of various quantum resources within this framework. We explore the evolution of entropic uncertainty and demonstrate its inverse correlation with both Bell nonlocality and coherence, highlighting the intricate interplay between these quantum resources. These insights provide a deeper understanding of quantumness in a relativistic framework and may contribute to the ongoing discussion on the black hole information paradox, the authors say.

## 14. Chern-Simons states of photons and gravitons

**Authors:** Z. Haba

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04220v1)

**Summary:**

We consider an alternative quantization of the electromagnetic field around the Chern-Simons state. The solution determines a stochastic process which is a random perturbation of the self-duality equation for the electromagnetic potential. The method can be applied to a quantification of non-Abelian gauge theories by means of a Stochastic self-Duality equation. A quantization  of massless spin 2 tensor fields (based on self- duality) and its extension to aQuantization of gravity are also discussed.

## 15. The Tropical Dirac Equation

**Authors:** Emil Albrychiewicz, Andrés Franco Valiente, Vi Hong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04145v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04145v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the tropical analog of spinors by representing tropical geometries as foliated Riemann surfaces endowed with degenerate complex structures. We show through Dirac-Bergmann's quantization procedure, that the corresponding tropicalized quantum field theories enjoy a purely fermionic topological symmetry. We also discuss how the tropical Dirac operator, when twisted by gauge fields, obeys a tropical version of the Lichnerowicz identity, thereby demonstrating how Yang-Mills curvature should arise in the tropical limit.

## 16. SU(7) Grand Gauge-Higgs Unification

**Authors:** Yuzuho Komori, Nobuhito Maru

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04090v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04090v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a model of six dimensional $SU(7)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification. We find some solutions providing the electroweak symmetry breaking and a realistic Higgs mass. Corresponding to each solution, the compactification scale of the fifth dimension is predicted. Furthermore, we evaluate the weak mixing angle at the weak scale by using one-loop renormalization group equation and find it to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The model is a six dimensional extension of five dimensional $ SU(4)$ gauge- Higgs unification predicting the weakmixing angle $/sin^2 /theta_W=1/4$

## 17. Code construction and ensemble holography of simply-laced WZW models at   level 1

**Authors:** Nikolaos Angelinos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04055v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a code construction for Wess-Zumino-Witten models associated with simply-laced affine Lie algebras at level 1. Each individual CFT is dual to a Chern-Simons theory, after gauging the maximal, non-anomalous subgroup of its $1$-form symmetry group specified by the code. We calculate the ensemble average of these CFTs, which is holographically dual to ``CS gravity" -- where the bulk theory is summed over topologies.
