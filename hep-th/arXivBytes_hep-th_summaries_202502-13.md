## 0. One loop analysis of the cubic action for gravity

**Authors:** Enrique Alvarez, Jesus Anero, Carmelo P. Martin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08434v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze some aspects of the cubic action for gravity recently proposed by Cheung and Remmen. In this approach both the spacetime metric and the connection are treated as independent fields. We discuss its BRST invariance and compute explicitly the one-loop contribution of quantum fluctuations around flat space, checking that the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identities are fulfilled. Finally, our results on a first order action are compared with the existing ones corresponding to a second order action. Back to Mail Online home.

## 1. Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset   cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data

**Authors:** Shulei Cao, Bharat Ratra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429v1)

**Summary:**

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$) We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation andcosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlated. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 exhibit $>2\sigma$ tension.

## 2. Phase transition in a doubly holographic model of closed $\mathbf{dS_{2}   }$ spacetime

**Authors:** Wen-Hao Jiang, Cheng Peng, Yun-Song Piao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08380v1)

**Summary:**

Double holography has been proved to be a powerful method in comprehending the spacetime entanglement. We find that in this model there exists a new extremal surface besides the Hartman-Maldacena surface and the island surface, which could lead to a more complex phase structure. We then propose a generalized mutual entropy to interpret the phase transition. However, this extremalsurface has a subtle property that the length of a part of the geodesic is negative when this saddle is dominant.

## 3. Normalizing Fock space states in static spacetimes

**Authors:** Jesse Huhtala, Iiro Vilja

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08325v1)

**Summary:**

In quantum field theory, sharp momentum states have to be normalized to be in Fock space. We investigate different normalization schemes, both box normalization and wave packets. These methods are equivalent in flat spacetimes, but turn out to produce different results in curved spacetime. This means that scattering processes have to. be defined in relation to the normalization scheme used, rather than being. independent of it as is the case in flat spacetime. We provide an illustrative example of this phenomenon.

## 4. Quantum corrected Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes in semiclassical   gravity

**Authors:** Ben Kain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08278v1)

**Summary:**

We study Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) black holes in semiclassical gravity by including in the field equations the expectation value of a renormalized energy-momentum tensor in the Polyakov approximation. In our system, which contains black hole hair, we find quantum corrected solutions in which the classical horizon disappears and is replaced by a wormhole structure, similarly to what is found in vacuum. Our results indicate that the inclusion of black hole Hair in semiclassesical gravity still leads to the disappearance of classical horizons for nonextremal black holes.

## 5. Noncommutative $p$-wave holographic superconductors

**Authors:** Souvik Paul, Sunandan Gangopadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08275v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08275v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we have studied the effects of noncommutative geometry on the properties of p-wave holographic superconductors with massive vector condensates in the probe limit. We have also found that just like the commutative case, here the DC conductivity diverges due to the presence of a first order pole in the frequency regime. In this model we have calculated the critical temperature and the value of the condensation operator for two different values of $m^2$.

## 6. Models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb   Z}_4$

**Authors:** Yoshiharu Kawamura, Eiji Kodaira, Kentaro Kojima, Toshifumi Yamashita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08250v1)

**Summary:**

We study six-dimensional $SU(n) gauge models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions. We find that a minimal model can describe the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry. Two Higgs doublets appear from the zero modes of the extra-dimensional gauge field. The quarks in each generation can be unified into one multiplet, without exotic quarks. We show that their direct contributions to the Higgs masses can be forbidden by a reflection symmetry, and thus, quadratic divergences are not reintroduced into theHiggs masses.

## 7. Integer dual dimensions in scale-separated AdS$_3$ from massive IIA

**Authors:** Fotis Farakos, George Tringas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08215v1)

**Summary:**

We study supersymmetric scale-separated AdS$_3$ flux vacua of massive IIA on G2 orbifolds with smeared orientifold planes. We consider two types of $T^7/Z_2^3$ orbifold which, with appropriate flux choices, yield integer dual dimensions for the operators corresponding to the closed string scalar fields in the dual CFT. We also look at two different types of G2 with different orientifolds.

## 8. Exploring Cosmological Implications of the Modified Raychaudhuri   Equation in Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy Theory

**Authors:** Arijit Panda, Eduardo Guendelman, Goutam Manna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08094v1)

**Summary:**

This article investigates the modified Raychaudhuri Equation (RE) in the context of Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy (NGVE) theory. The equation is formulated based on the NGVE framework, in which global scale invariance generates a unique geometry. The newly developed geometry introduces a metric that is conformally connected to the conventional metric. The cosmological study is carried out under the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe.

## 9. Fermionic CFTs from topological boundaries in abelian Chern-Simons   theories

**Authors:** Kohki Kawabata, Tatsuma Nishioka, Takuya Okuda, Shinichiro Yahagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08084v1)

**Summary:**

We explore fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) that emerge from bosonic abelian Chern-Simons theories. CFTs play the role of a symmetry topological field theory, by imposing topological boundary conditions. Our construction includes the fermanionic generalization of code C FTs. When the Chern- Simons theory is associated with the root lattice of a simply laced Lie algebra, this approach yields a fermionics CFT with a level-one affine Lie algebra symmetry.
