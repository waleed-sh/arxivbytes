## 0. Multipoint conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Part I: Bipartite   Mellin-Barnes representation and reconstruction

**Authors:** K. B. Alkalaev, Semyon Mandrygin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12127v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a systematic approach to calculating $n$-point one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. It relies on decomposing a conformal integral over basis functions which are generated from a set of master functions by acting with the cyclic group. In order to identify the master functions we introduce a bipartite Mellin-Barnes representation. For the box and pentagon integrals (i.e. $n=4,5$) we show that a computable part of the representation contains all master functions.

## 1. The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon   curvature perturbations at one loop

**Authors:** Keisuke Inomata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112v1)

**Summary:**

Recently, papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one.loop power spectrum of superHorizon curvatures. In the comoving gauge, we show that these contributions play an important role in the cancellation.

## 2. The sinusoidal valley: a recipe for high peaks in the scalar and induced   tensor spectra

**Authors:** Aris Katsis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12015v1)

**Summary:**

A sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.

## 3. Non-invertible symmetry breaking in a frustration-free spin chain

**Authors:** Akash Sinha, Vivek Kumar Singh, Pramod Padmanabhan, Kun Hao, Vladimir Korepin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11997v1)

**Summary:**

A nearest-neighbor, frustration-free spin chain can be constructed using projectors of various ranks. We show that in the rank 1 case this system is gapped and has two ground states resembling ferromagnetic states. These states spontaneously break the non-invertible symmetry connecting them. The latter is proved using the machinery of algebraic quantum theory. The non- invertible symmetries of this system do not come from a duality. We conclude that the system is not symmetric.

## 4. Correlation functions of degenerate fields in Super-Liouville field   theory

**Authors:** Aleksandra Ivanova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11996v1)

**Summary:**

We study four-point correlation functions of degenerated fields in the $NS$ sector in Super-Liouville field theory. We find integral expressions for these functions using the BPZ equation, and study some superconformal properties of these solutions. Finally, we present the general form for three- point correlation functions in the field theory of superconductors and super-conductors. We conclude by looking at some of the properties of three-point correlations in the superconducting superconductor.

## 5. Entanglement and Effective Field Theories

**Authors:** Jorge Gamboa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11819v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the emergence of geometric phases in chiral transformations within gauge theories coupled to fermions. Using the adiabatic approximation, we demonstrate that chiral. transformations are modified by the emerged of a nontrivial Berry phase. Berry phases play a crucial role in the infrared structure of QED, potentially providing a mechanism for regularizing infrared divergences in theories with axial anomalies. This framework establishes a novel connection between chiral symmetries, anomalies, and geometric phases.

## 6. Gravitational lensing by charged black hole with global monopole in   strong field limit

**Authors:** Yi-Ling Lan, Yun-Feng Qu, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813v1)

**Summary:**

The study looked at gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime. The dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the monopole. The results presented here could be experimentally explored in analogue gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study. The findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopoles on gravitational Lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions.

## 7. Branes in String/M-Theory

**Authors:** J. X. Lu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11575v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11575v1)

**Summary:**

This is the writeup of lectures delivered in Asian Pacific introductory school on superstring and the related topics in Beijing (2006) and the expanded version of these lectures in the 3rd summer school on strings, fields and holography in Nanjing (2023) It intends to give a historical as well as a pedagogical account of the development in finding the 1/2 BPS extended string solitons in the early stage of the so-called second string revolution. Non-susy solutions which are related to brane/anti brane systems or non-BPS systems are also discussed.

## 8. An alternative formulation of infra-red counterterms

**Authors:** I. Jack

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11558v1)

**Summary:**

We present an alternative procedure for defining infra-red counterterms within dimensional regularisation for use in the $R^*$ procedure. The counterterms are given by simple closed expressions, and lead to the standard MSbar UV counterterms. We present the alternative procedure in the next section of this article.

## 9. AdS gravaster and bulk-cone singularities

**Authors:** Heng-Yu Chen, Yasuaki Hikida, Yasutaka Koga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11403v1)

**Summary:**

The horizon of a black hole is surrounded by the photon sphere. An outside observer cannot easily examine the geometry inside the sphere. In this note, we propose a way to investigate the region from dual conformal field theory. We first construct gravaster geometry as an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime. We then compute numerically the retarded Green function from the bulk theory and observe bulk-cone singularities corresponding to null geodesics traveling into the interior region. We show that it is possible to examine the region inside the photons sphere from bulk- cone singularities of dual conformist theory.

## 10. On the relevance of GIKS instability of charged N=4 SYM plasma

**Authors:** Alex Buchel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11354v1)

**Summary:**

GIKS identified a novel instability of supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma with a diagonal $U(1)$ $R$-symmetry chemical potential. We show that while the superconducting instability is indeed present, it happens at a lower critical temperature compare to that of the GIKS instability. We also show that the instability is present in a different way than in the GikS instability, and that it is not as severe as first thought. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the instability.
