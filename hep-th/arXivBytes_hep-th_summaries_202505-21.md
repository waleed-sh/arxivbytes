## 0. Canonical Differential Equations for Cosmology from Positive Geometries

**Authors:** Mattia Capuano, Livia Ferro, Tomasz Lukowski, Alessandro Palazio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14609v1)

**Summary:**

Cosmological correlation functions are central observables in modern cosmology. They encode properties of the early universe. In this paper, we derive novel canonical differential equations for wavefunction coefficients in power-law FRW cosmologies. We combine positive geometries and the combinatorics of tubings of Feynman graphs to create the equations. We provide explicit results for specific examples and conjecture that this approach works for any graph. The equations are related to region variables with the same notion of tubing.

## 1. A Renormalizable Model of Quantized Gravitational and Matter Fields

**Authors:** D. G. C. McKeon, F. T. Brandt, J. Frenkel, S. Martins-Filho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14554v1)

**Summary:**

A Lagrange multiplier field can be used to restrict radiative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action to one-loop order. This result is employed to show that it is possible to couple a scalar field to the metric (graviton) field in such a way that the model is both renormalizable and unitary. The usual Einstein equations of motion for the gravitational field are recovered, perturbatively, in the classical limit. By evaluating the generating functional of proper Green's functions in closed form one obtains a novel analytic contribution to the effective action.

## 2. Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary

**Authors:** Griffen Adams, Ovidiu Costin, Gerald V. Dunne, Sergei Gukov, Oğuz Öner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441v1)

**Summary:**

We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory. We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory.

## 3. On entanglement c-functions in confining gauge field theories

**Authors:** Niko Jokela, Jani Kastikainen, Carlos Nunez, José Manuel Penín, Helime Ruotsalainen, Javier G. Subils

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14397v1)

**Summary:**

Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. We argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicism in the infrared.

## 4. Strings and near-extremal black holes in theories with large   $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry

**Authors:** Sameer Murthy, Mukund Rangamani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14380v1)

**Summary:**

We study the one-loop partition function of superstrings in the $AdS_3$ background. We show that the supergravity spectrum, which contains non-chiral primary states, can be recovered by this partition function in the semiclassical limit. We also show how the boundary currents are encoded in the string spectrum. Finally, we comment on the limit when the AdS curvature radius is string scale, which is directly accessible within the RNS formalism for this compactification.

## 5. Butterfly effect and $\textrm{T}\overline{\textrm{T}}$-deformation

**Authors:** Debarshi Basu, Ashish Chandra, Qiang Wen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14331v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14331v1)

**Summary:**

These notes present a comprehensive analysis of shockwave geometries in holographic settings. By constructing deformed metrics and employing Kruskal coordinates, we examine out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) as probes of quantum chaos. We also study localized shockwave solutions and analyze their backreaction. The results obtained via shockwave methods are corroborated with recent developments in pole-skipping phenomena and the entanglement wedge approach, demonstrating consistency among distinct probes of chaos.

## 6. Duality and four-dimensional black holes: gravitational waves,   algebraically special solutions, pole skipping, and the spectral duality   relation in holographic thermal CFTs

**Authors:** Sašo Grozdanov, Mile Vrbica

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14229v1)

**Summary:**

The physics of gravitational waves and other classical fields on specifically four-dimensional backgrounds of black holes exhibits electric-magnetic-like dualities. In this paper, we discuss the structure of such dualities in terms of geometrical quantities with a physically-intuitive interpretation. We then use these results and apply them to the holographic study of three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) The dualities enforce the recently-developed spectral duality relation along with a multitude of implications for the physics of thermal CFTs.

## 7. Bispectrum from five-dimensional inflation

**Authors:** Ignatios Antoniadis, Auttakit Chatrabhuti, Jules Cunat, Hiroshi Isono

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14225v1)

**Summary:**

Five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal. 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times.

## 8. Dynamical Systems and Superstring Phases in the Early Universe

**Authors:** Noelia Sánchez González, Joseph P. Conlon, Edmund J. Copeland, Edward Hardy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14187v1)

**Summary:**

Study the string theory dynamics of the volume scalar rolling down an exponential potential during the period between inflation and reheating. In the context of the LVS potential, we demonstrate the existence of a novel string loop attractor tracker solution. 75% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a gas of fundamental cosmic superstring loops (a configuration preferred over the standard radiation tracker) On this tracker, it is the continual reduction in the string tension that makes the loops stable against decay.

## 9. Linearized renormalization

**Authors:** L. L. Salcedo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14152v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14152v1)

**Summary:**

Using an infinitesimal approach, this work addresses the renormalization problem to deal with the ultraviolet divergences arising in quantum field theory. Under the assumption that the action has already been renormalized to yield an ultraviolet-finite effective action, we analyze how the action must be adjusted. The analysis then provides the change that is induced on the correlation functions of the theory. This program is successfully carried out in the case of super-renormalizable theories, namely, a scalar field with cubic interaction in four space-time dimensions and with quartic interaction in three space- time dimensions.

## 10. Casimir effect for scalar field rotating on a disk

**Authors:** M. Bordag, I. G. Pirozhenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14093v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the vacuum energy of a scalar field rotating with angular velocity $Omega$ on a disk of radius $R$ The rotation is introduced by a metric obtained by a Galilean transformation from a rest frame. We use the zeta-functional regularization and separate the divergent contributions, which we discuss in terms of the heat kernel coefficients. The divergences are found to be independent of rotation. The renormalized finite part of the vacuumEnergy is negative and becomes more negative for larger rotation frequencies.

## 11. An Ode to the Penrose and Witten transforms in Twistor space for 3D CFT

**Authors:** Aswini Bala, Dhruva K. S

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14082v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the construction of Sp$(4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant objects in the twistor space for three dimensional conformal field theories. We show that this feature can be traced to the Penrose and Witten transforms of these operators that we derive. Similar to the non supersymmetric case, we find an important role played by the (super) infinity twistor which we exemplify through parity odd super-correlators and a supers asymmetric contact term.

## 12. Anomaly-free twistorial higher-spin theories

**Authors:** Tung Tran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13785v1)

**Summary:**

We present twistor BV actions that encompasses many classically consistent bosonic holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories with vanishing cosmological constant. Upon quantization, these actions are shown to be quantum consistent, i.e. no gauge anomaly. Anomaly-free twistorial theories can be identified through an index theorem, which is an extension of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch index theorem. We also discuss the anomaly cancellation mechanisms on twistor space to render anomalous theories quantum consistent at one loop.
