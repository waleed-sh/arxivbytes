## 0. Anisotropic conformal Carroll field theories and their gravity duals

**Authors:** Emilie Despontin, Stephane Detournay, Sudipta Dutta, Dima Fontaine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23755v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate anisotropic conformal Carroll field theories and their holographic duals. On the field theory side, we focus on the case with scaling exponent $z=0$ in two and three spacetime dimensions. We identify three and four-dimensional plane wave geometries whose isometry algebras realise the two- and three-dimensional Carroll algebra. We propose, for each scaling exponent, a phase space of asymptotically-plane wave spacetimes and show that the residual diffeomorphisms reproduce the expected Carroll field theory algebra.

## 1. Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories

**Authors:** Mark P. Hertzberg, Oleksandr S. Stashko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712v1)

**Summary:**

We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.

## 2. Boundary terms in cosmology

**Authors:** Ángel Cuevas, Javier Chagoya, C. Ortiz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679v1)

**Summary:**

In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. We predict a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter. It can be related to a scalar field known as kination.

## 3. Measurements $\mathit{with}$ probabilities in the final state proposal

**Authors:** Ahmed Almheiri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23664v1)

**Summary:**

Bousso and Stanford (BS) argued that the black hole final state proposal leads to acausal effects and ill-defined probabilities for the AMPS experiment. We identify a loophole in their analysis using insights from entanglement wedge reconstruction and replica wormholes. We trace the cause of the BS problems to the misidentification of the physical interior where the second AMPS measurement happens from among the multiple interiors introduced by the first measurement.

## 4. Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R,   T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Uttaran Ghosh, Sarbari Guha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we examine the structure scalars formed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor of the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in $f(R,T)$ gravity. The dependence of various physical parameters, such as heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar and effective homogeneous energy density, has been clearly indicated. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure Scalars and the total mass-energy content.

## 5. Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix   elements in integrable spin chains

**Authors:** Federico Rottoli, Vincenzo Alba

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23602v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains. We focus on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain) We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results to efficiently compute matrix elements. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as those that belong to different macrostates. We numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay.

## 6. Constraining primordial curvature perturbations with present and future   GW detectors

**Authors:** Mauro Pieroni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23521v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23521v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$) can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbation, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. An enhanced primordial power spectrum can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB) We briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets.

## 7. Causality Constraints on Black Hole Thermodynamics in Nonlinear   Electrodynamics

**Authors:** Yoshihiko Abe, Maxime Médevielle, Toshifumi Noumi, Kaho Yoshimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23483v1)

**Summary:**

In nonlinear electrodynamics, the Lagrangian is taken to be an arbitrary function of the electromagnetic field strength tensor. By requiring the absence of superluminal propagation, we show that the mass-to-charge ratio of extremal black holes exhibits a certain monotonicity. Under the same condition, we demonstrate that the entropy- to-mass-squared ratio of black holes decreases monotonically with increasing mass, while keeping the mass to charge ratio fixed.

## 8. Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at   finite density

**Authors:** Francesco Benini, Ohad Mamroud, Tomas Reis, Marco Serone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388v1)

**Summary:**

We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. We show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons.

## 9. Associators for AdS string amplitude building blocks

**Authors:** Konstantin Baune

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23385v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23385v1)

**Summary:**

We show that building blocks for open- and closed-string amplitudes on AdS are generated by the Drinfeld and Deligne associator. Our formalism lifts the known associator recursions for flat-space string amplitudes to the AdS picture. This delivers another proof that AdS building blocks admit low-energy expansions with (single-valued) multiple zeta values as coefficients. It also provides all-order relations for the integral expressions. The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics.

## 10. On the spectra of holographic QFTs on constant curvature manifolds

**Authors:** Ahmad Ghodsi, Elias Kiritsis, Parisa Mashayekhi, Francesco Nitti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23366v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze linear fluctuations of five-dimensional Einstein-Dilaton theories dual to holographic quantum field theories. We identify the physical propagating scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. We numerically compute the spectra in a concrete model characterized by a polynomial dilaton bulk potential admitting holographic RG-flow solutions with a UV and IR fixed points. In this case, we find no discrete spectrum and no perturbative instabilities. In the dual QFT, the eigenstates correspond to towers of spin-0 and spin-2 particles propagating on $(A)dS_4$

## 11. Black hole/de Sitter as the fastest transmitter/receiver

**Authors:** Rong-Gen Cai, Li Hu, Shao-Jiang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23314v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum speed limit on how fast a quantum system can evolve unitarily, when saturating the maximal information transmission bounds (Pendry's bound and Bremermann-Bekenstein bound), will slow down the would-be divergent rate of dynamical black hole entropy decreasing at the very end of the Hawking evaporation. Therefore, an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole is the fastest transmitter of information in nature. The would- be-ended inflating de Sitter space is theFastest Receiver of Information in Nature.

## 12. Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data

**Authors:** C. Pallis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity with a kinetic mixing of the form fk=fR^m reconciles chaotic inflation based on the phi^n potential. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field.

## 13. Chaos in the holographic matrix models for meson and baryon

**Authors:** Si-wen Li, Xun Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23199v1)

**Summary:**

In recent years, the investigation of chaos has become a bridge connecting gravity theory and quantum field theory, especially within the framework of gauge-gravity duality. In this work, we study holographically the chaos in the matrix models for meson and baryon. These analyses suggest that chaos might serve as an order parameter to detect the gauge theory with spontaneous breaking or restoration of symmetry. Overall, the Investigation of chaos in this work may be helpful to identify common features shared by the Matrix models, hadronic physics, gauge theory, quantum mechanics, and gravity theory.

## 14. Critical phenomenon of quantum BTZ black holes

**Authors:** Hong-Ming Cui, Zhong-Ying Fan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23188v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23188v1)

**Summary:**

We extend the thermodynamics of quantum BTZ black holes by treating the quantum backreaction strength parameter $\nu$ as a thermodynamic variable. We find various novel features, including an unexpected discontinuity around the critical point. We prove that given an arbitrarily small angular momenta, only one stable black hole phase can exist and hence no transition will occur. The critical exponents are significantly different from the mean field theory results and violate one of the scaling laws. We present an intepretation for this by using a universal three scale factor hypothesis for critical behavior of thermodynamics.

## 15. On construction of correlation numbers in super Minimal Liouville   Gravity in the Ramond sector

**Authors:** V. Belavin, J. Ramos Cabezas, B. Runov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23122v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23122v1)

**Summary:**

We study the construction of correlation numbers in super minimal Liouville gravity. We construct the fundamental physical fields in the Ramond sector and compute the three-point correlation number involving two physical fields. We establish the relation between Ramond physical fields and the elements of the ground ring. Using the higher equations of motion, this relation leads to a new representation of Ramond fields. This formulation enables a direct analytic computation of correlationNumbers involving Ramond field insertions. As an application, we demonstrate the method in the simplest case of a three- point correlation function.

## 16. Bounds on the minimum orbital periods of non-singular Hayward and   Bardeen black holes

**Authors:** Guohua Liu, Yan Peng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23000v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the minimum orbital periods of objects around Hayward and Bardeen black holes without central singularities. Our results imply that such bounds may be connected to the presence of the black hole horizon rather than the singularity. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that both Hayward & Bardeen Black Holes conform to these bounds. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.
