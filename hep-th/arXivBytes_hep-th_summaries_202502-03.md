## 0. A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state   fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the   $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier

**Authors:** Guanyu Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction. This suggests that these codes can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLD PC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states.

## 1. Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory

**Authors:** Mahendra Verma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19367v1)

**Summary:**

Turbulence field theory has been successfully ported to turbulence. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, we cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency. We conclude with a review of the key results of turbulence field theory for hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity.

## 2. MHV leaf amplitudes from parafermions

**Authors:** Laura Donnay, Gaston Giribet, Beniamino Valsesia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19332v1)

**Summary:**

We give a dual CFT representation of MHV leaf amplitudes in the large $N$ and semiclassical limit in terms of non-compact parafermions and a single affine Kac-Moody current for $SO(N)$. This representation is consistent with the other 2D CFT realization of 4D leaf Amplitudes proposed in the literature. The equivalence between the two CFT descriptions arises from the $H_3^+$ WZW-Liouville correspondence, applied to the $SL(2) coset theory in the spectrally flowed sector.

## 3. Modular covariant torus partition functions of dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and   dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models

**Authors:** Alexi Morin-Duchesne, Andreas Klümper, Paul A. Pearce

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19288v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19288v1)

**Summary:**

Yang-Baxter integrable loop models are considered on the torus in their simplest physical regimes. We conjecture the scaling limits of the transfer matrix traces in the standard modules with $d$ defects and deduce the conformal partition functions. Crucially, we find that the partition functions are identical for the dense and dilute models. The coincidence of these partition functions provides compelling evidence that, for given $(p,p')$, these dense and Dilute theories lie in the same universality class.

## 4. Information Metrics and Possible Limitations of Local Information   Objectivity in Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** Per Berglund, Andrew Geraci, Tristan Hubsch, David Mattingly, Djordje Minic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19269v1)

**Summary:**

 quantum gravity typically violates some of the Cencov assumptions, allowing the Fisher metric and Born rule to vary between observers. We explain these violations, some possible experimental tests, and a new quantum gravity approach based on generally covariant information geometry. We also propose a new type of quantum gravity, based on a more general type of information geometry than the one used in quantum gravity. We conclude that quantum gravity is not a fully-fledged theory, but rather a theory of a type of theory.

## 5. Resumming Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian gravitational waveform   expansions

**Authors:** Andrea Cipriani, Giorgio Di Russo, Francesco Fucito, José Francisco Morales, Hasmik Poghosyan, Rubik Poghossian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19257v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational waveform emitted by a particle moving in a Schwarzschild geometry can be computed, in perturbation theory, as a double series expansion. For scattering processes they describe complementary regions of spacetime. In this paper, we derive all order formulae for those two expansions of the waveform, where the entire dependence on the $y$ or $z$ variables is resummed under the assumption. The results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the confluent Heun functions.

## 6. Fractons from covariant higher-rank 3D BF theory

**Authors:** Erica Bertolini, Alberto Blasi, Matteo Carrega, Nicola Maggiore, Daniel Sacco Shaikh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19154v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study the 3D gauge theory of two tensor gauge fields. Once matter is introduced, a fracton behaviour naturally emerges. We show that our theory can be mapped to the low-energy effective field theory describing the Rank-2 Toric Code (R2TC) This relation between our covariant BF-like theory and the R2TC is a higher-rank generalization of the equivalence between the ordinary 3D BF theory and Kitaev's Toric code.

## 7. Results on meson-meson scattering at large $N_\text{c}$

**Authors:** Jorge Baeza-Ballesteros, Pilar Hernández, Fernando Romero-López

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19115v1)

**Summary:**

We present results on the large $N_\text{c}$ scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb. For one of the channels, we find indications of a virtual bound state at $N-3$ which may be related to one of these exotic states. Using L\"uscher's quantization condition, we constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude.

## 8. Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary   mergers

**Authors:** Yong Gao, Kota Hayashi, Kenta Kiuchi, Alan Tsz-Lok Lam, Hao-Jui Kuan, Masaru Shibata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053v1)

**Summary:**

We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger. Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. We observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode after the merger, but we also find that the growth of the mode amplitude may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation.

## 9. On (de Sitter) Vacua in Heterotic String Theory

**Authors:** Nicole Righi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19015v1)

**Summary:**

Heterotic toroidal orbifolds are a powerful framework for testing our understanding of string vacua. We review recent advances in heterotic model building, from constructing new vacua to proving novel de Sitter no-go theorems. We also illustrate a potential loophole that could pave the way for the realisation of de Sitters vacua within heterotic string theories. This involves the introduction of non-perturbative, stringy, dilaton-dependent corrections to the Kahler potential.

## 10. Entanglement Entropy and Cauchy-Hadamard Renormalization

**Authors:** Benoit Estienne, Jiasheng Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19014v1)

**Summary:**

This note presents a purely geometric construction of the so-called twist-field correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. This approach provides a purely mathematical interpretation of the seminal results in physics by Cardy and Calabrese. We also provide a discussion of the physical background and motivation for entanglement entropy, focusing on path integrals and the replica trick, which serves as an introduction to these ideas for a mathematical audience. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the theory of quantum systems.

## 11. Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology

**Authors:** Hiroshi Iritani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18849v1)

**Summary:**

Equivariant quantum cohomology possesses the structure of a difference module by shift operators. Teleman's conjecture suggests that shift operators and equivariant parameters acting on QH_T(X) should be identified, respectively, with the Novikov variables and the quantum connection of the GIT quotient X//T. We introduce the notion of "quantum volume," derived from Givental's path integral over the Floer fundamental cycle. We also explore the "reduction conjecture," developed in collaboration with Fumihiko Sanda, which expresses the I-function of X //T as a discrete Fourier transform.

## 12. Note on single-trace EYM amplitudes with MHV configuration

**Authors:** Zhirun Li, Yi-Jian Du

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18832v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18832v1)

**Summary:**

In the maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) configuration, tree-level single-trace Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) amplitude with one and two gravitons have been shown to satisfy a formula where each graviton splits into a pair of collinear gluons. In this paper, we extend this formula to more general cases. We provide a general formula which expresses tree- level single- trace MHV amplitudes in terms of pure gluon amplitudes.
