## 0. Gravitational wave anisotropies from axion inflation

**Authors:** Sofia P. Corbà

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13156v1)

**Summary:**

An important prediction of inflation is the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background. Observing this background is challenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of an astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. In this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational wave anisotropies in the cosmological background. This result shows that axion inflation can generate large anisotropic with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave detectors within a reasonable time frame.

## 1. Relative entropy of squeezed states in Quantum Field Theory

**Authors:** Marcelo S. Guimaraes, Itzhak Roditi, Silvio P. Sorella, Arthur F. Vieira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13148v1)

**Summary:**

Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a squeezed state and the vacuum state in a free relativistic massive scalar Quantum Field Theory. This relative entropy is proportional to the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution. The entropy remains positive, increases with the size of the Minkowski region under consideration, and decreases as the mass parameter grows. It satisfies all expected properties: it remains positive and increases with size of Minkowskis region. It also decreases as mass parameters grow.

## 2. Freezing of the renormalized one-loop primordial scalar power spectrum

**Authors:** Matteo Braglia, Lucas Pinol

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13136v1)

**Summary:**

We explicitly prove that the renormalized one-loop power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation freezes exactly on scales larger than its sound horizon. By consistently using the effective field theory of inflationary fluctuations in the decoupling limit, we consistently prove that this is the case. We also show that this freezing occurs on a scale larger than the sound horizon, and that it is not due to a quantum leap in the speed of light. We conclude by saying that this freezes on the scale of the universe’s speed of sound.

## 3. Supersymmetric Poisson and Poisson-supersymmetric sigma models

**Authors:** Thomas Basile, Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis, Sylvain Lavau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13114v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit and construct new examples of supersymmetric 2D topological sigma models whose target space is a Poisson supermanifold. Inspired by the AKSZ construction of topological field theories, we follow a graded-geometric approach. We identify two commuting homological vector fields compatible with the graded symplectic structure, which control the gauge symmetries and the supersymmetries of the sigma model. We show that the common thread through this type of models is that their supersymmetry-generating vector field is the coadjoint representation up to homotopy of a Lie algebroid.

## 4. Perturbed symmetric-product orbifold: first-order mixing and puzzles for   integrability

**Authors:** Matheus Fabri, Alessandro Sfondrini, Torben Skrzypek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13091v1)

**Summary:**

We study the marginal deformation of the symmetric-product orbifold theory. The dimension of certain single-cycle operators is corrected. We also discuss a flaw in the original derivation of the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifolds. Together, these observations suggest that more needs to be done to correctly identify and exploit the Integrable Structure of the Perturbed Orbifold CFT. The full study can be found at: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/28/science/science-topics/perturbed-orbifold-cft-perturbation.

## 5. Quadratic gravity with propagating torsion and asymptotic freedom

**Authors:** Oleg Melichev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13090v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13090v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a class of metric-affine gravitational theories with action quadratic in curvature and torsion tensors. It is found that vectorial and axial components of torsions preserve the qualitative picture of the renormalization group flow of the metric sector. However, there exists a specific nonminimal kinetic term for the pure tensorial (hook-antisymmetric traceless) component that renders the gravitational couplings asymptotically free in the absence of tachyons.

## 6. Proca theory of four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet gravity and   black holes with primary hair

**Authors:** Christos Charmousis, Pedro G. S. Fernandes, Mokhtar Hassaine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13084v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a novel, well-defined four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity by applying a dimensional regularization procedure. We then consider the static spherically symmetric solutions of this theory and find black hole solutions that acquire primary hair. One of the integration constants associated with the Proca field is not manifest in the original metric, but under a disformal transformation of the seed solution, it emerges as a second, independentPrimary hair. This additional hair acts as an effective cosmological constant in the disformed geometry, even in the absence of a bare cosmologically constant term.

## 7. Radiative properties of a nonsingular black hole: Hawking radiation and   gray-body factor

**Authors:** Asier Alonso-Bardaji, David Brizuela, Marc Schneider

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13050v1)

**Summary:**

We study the radiative properties of a spherical and singularity-free black-hole geometry. Contrary to the Schwarzschild spacetime, this geometry is geodesically complete and regular. Since the gravitational potential is shallower than in Schwarzschild, the emission spectrum turns out to be colder and purer (less gray) We conclude that, instead of completely evaporating, it naturally leads to a remnant, which provides a possible resolution of the information loss issue. We explicitly compute the spectrum of the Hawking radiation and the gray-body factor.

## 8. Competing Bosonic Reactions: Insight from Exactly Solvable   Time-Dependent Models

**Authors:** Fumika Suzuki, Rajesh K. Malla, Nikolai A. Sinitsyn

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13027v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class. We also discuss the application of these models to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum.

## 9. Two-loop Feynman integrals for leading colour $t\bar{t}W$ production at   hadron colliders

**Authors:** Matteo Becchetti, Dhimiter Canko, Vsevolod Chestnov, Tiziano Peraro, Mattia Pozzoli, Simone Zoia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13011v1)

**Summary:**

We compute a complete set of the two-loop Feynman integrals that are required for QCD corrections to on-shell top-pair production in association with a $W$ boson at hadron colliders. We employ the method of differential equations (DEs), facilitated by the use of finite field methods to handle the algebraic complexity stemming from the seven-scale kinematics. We obtain DEs that depend at most quadratically on the dimensional regulator $epsilon$ for sectors where these analytic structures appear.
