## 0. Useful trick to compute correlation functions of composite operators

**Authors:** Giovani Peruzzo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17138v1)

**Summary:**

In gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by gauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. We present a useful trick to compute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This trick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to the composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the traditional algorithms used to compute correlation function of elementary fields. We conclude that this trick is a useful way to compute loops in gauge field theory.

## 1. Observing Hot Holographic Quark Star With Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Le-Feng Chen, Heng-Yi Yuan, Meng-Hua Zhou, Kun Lu, Jing-Yi Wu, Kilar Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17121v1)

**Summary:**

We extract the equation of state for hot quark matter from a holographic $2+1$ flavor QCD model. By adding a thin hadron shell, a new type of hybrid star is constructed. With the temperature serving as a parameter, the EoS varies. We obtain stable stars with the maximum mass of around 23 to 30 solar masses, and the compactness around $0.1$. These compact stars are candidates for black hole mimickers, which could be observed by gravitational waves.

## 2. Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature

**Authors:** Peter Lowdon, Owe Philipsen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17120v1)

**Summary:**

Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, which is distinct from standard perturbative expectations, and determine its corresponding spectral properties. The study was published in the journal Theoretical Physics and is published by the Royal Society of London.

## 3. Chiral oscillations in finite time quantum field theory

**Authors:** Massimo Blasone, Francesco Giacosa, Luca Smaldone, Giorgio Torrieri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17111v1)

**Summary:**

Chiral oscillations of a massive Dirac field can be described using a finite-time interaction picture approach. The mass term in the Lagrangian is treated as a perturbative coupling between massless fields of definite chirality. We argue that chiral oscillation are also essential for detecting the decay products in such processes. We illustrate how this framework can effectively describe production processes where an electron must exhibit both left chirability and positive helicity, as in decay. We derive the formula for chiral occurrences at the fourth order in the perturbatives expansion.

## 4. Resummed effective actions and heat kernels: the Worldline approach and   Yukawa assisted pair creation

**Authors:** Filippo Fecit, Sebastián Franchino-Viñas, Francisco D. Mazzitelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17094v1)

**Summary:**

We adapt the Worldline Formalism to obtain resummed expressions for the effective action and the heat kernel of a quantum scalar field coupled to a Yukawa background. The resummation includes all the invariants built from powers, first derivatives and second derivatives of the latter. Using such results, we compute the instability of the vacuum computing the vacuum persistence amplitude and the corresponding Schwinger pair production probability. We show that the inclusion of an additional, rapidly varying background can greatly enhance the production of pairs.

## 5. Wormholes, branes and finite matrices in sine dilaton gravity

**Authors:** Andreas Blommaert, Adam Levine, Thomas G. Mertens, Jacopo Papalini, Klaas Parmentier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17091v1)

**Summary:**

The wormhole size is discretized. The wormhole amplitude matches the spectral correlation of a finite-cut matrix integral. This strongly suggests an identification of the sine dilaton gravity theory with the q-deformed JT gravity Matrix integral. The disk decomposes into the physical (gauge invariant) solutions of the WdW equation, which are trumpets with discrete sizes. This decomposition modifies the usual no-boundary wavefunction to a normalizable one in sine Dilaton gravity.

## 6. Lyapunov exponents as probes for phase transitions of Kerr-AdS black   holes

**Authors:** Deyou Chen, Chuang Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16999v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study proper time and coordinate time Lyapunov exponents of chaos for massless and massive particles. We explore their relationships with phase transitions of four-dimensional and five-dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes. The results reveal that these Lyap unov exponent can reflect the occurrence of phase transitions. We also conduct a study on the critical exponents associated with the Lyap Unov Exponent value of 1/2 in Kerr AdS blackholes.

## 7. Can the sound horizon-free measurement of $H_0$ constrain early new   physics?

**Authors:** Jun-Qian Jiang, Yun-Song Piao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16883v1)

**Summary:**

The sound horizon-independent $H_0$ extracted by using galaxy clustering surveys data through, e.g., EFTofLSS or ShapeFit analyses, is considered to have the potential to constrain the early new physics responsible for solving the Hubble tension. In this work, we clarify some potential misuses and misinterpretations in these analyses. We also make forecasts for an Euclid-like survey, which suggest that ongoing observations will also have difficulty ruling out early new Physics.

## 8. Multi-Messenger and Cosmological Constraints on Dark Matter through   Two-Fluid Neutron Star Modeling

**Authors:** Ankit Kumar, Sudhakantha Girmohanta, Hajime Sotani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16829v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using a two-fluid formalism that treats nuclear matter (NM) and DM as gravitationally coupled components. We explore the emergence of DM core- and halo-dominated structures and their observational implications. This work bridges multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology, providing insights into DM interactions and their implications for NS structure, evolution, and observational signatures.

## 9. Perfect fluid dynamics with conformal Newton-Hooke symmetries

**Authors:** Timofei Snegirev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16781v1)

**Summary:**

Perfect fluid equations are formulated which are invariant under the Newton-Hooke group for an arbitrary integer or half-integer value of the parameter. For $\ell=\frac32$ the corresponding conserved charges are constructed and the Hamiltonian formulation is built. The Hamiltonian is a form of the Hamilton equation. For example, the Hamilton equations can be written as: "F" + "C" "H" = "E" "F" + "H" "C" = "E"

## 10. Confined Monopoles in Chiral Bag

**Authors:** Fan Lin, Yong-Liang Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16653v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16653v1)

**Summary:**

The chiral bag model provides a dual description of hadron physics in terms of quarks and hadrons in the sense of Cheshire Cat principle. We find that confinement is likely caused by monopole condensation. We also propose that the skyrmion description of baryons should be understood as a system of monopoles enveloped by a meson cloud. To obtain the correct net baryon number, vector meson field interactions occur on the bag surface and extend outside the bag.
