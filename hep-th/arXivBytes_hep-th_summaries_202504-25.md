## 0. Thermal Product Formula for Shear Modes

**Authors:** Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, Nibedita Padhi, Aditya Sharma, Sourav Singha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17781v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in ArXiv[2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in AdS5. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.

## 1. Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability

**Authors:** Zhao Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773v1)

**Summary:**

The existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the three-local charge.

## 2. Extended Scalar Particle Solutions in Black String Spacetimes with   Anisotropic Quintessence

**Authors:** M. L. Deglmann, B. V. Simão, C. C. Barros Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765v1)

**Summary:**

We present new solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar particle in a black string spacetime immersed in an anisotropic quintessence fluid surrounded by a cloud of strings. We investigate the cases when $\alpha_{Q} = 0,\,1/2, \,1$, encompassing both black hole and horizonless scenarios. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics of scalar particles in this complex spacetime and the potential impact of dark energy on quantum systems.

## 3. Orbifolds, higher dagger structures, and idempotents

**Authors:** Nils Carqueville, Tim Lüders

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17764v1)

**Summary:**

The orbifold/condensation completion procedure of defect topological quantum field theories can be seen as carrying out a lattice or state sum model construction internal to an ambient theory. In this paper, we propose a conceptual algebraic description of orbifolds/condensations for arbitrary tangential structures in terms of higher dagger structures and higher idempotents. We provide several examples ofhigher dagger categories, such as those associated to state sum models, (orbifolds of) Landau--Ginzburg models, and truncated affine Rozansky--Witten models.

## 4. WI2easy: warm inflation dynamics made easy

**Authors:** Gabriel S. Rodrigues, Rudnei O. Ramos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17760v1)

**Summary:**

WI2easy is a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics. It enables efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. The tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials, including large-field, small-field and hybrid models. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. It offers a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.

## 5. On canonical differential equations for Calabi-Yau multi-scale Feynman   integrals

**Authors:** Sara Maggio, Yoann Sohnle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17757v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17757v1)

**Summary:**

We generalise a method recently introduced in the literature, that derives canonical differential equations, to multi-scale Feynman integrals with an underlying Calabi-Yau geometry. We motivate our construction by studying the Picard-Fuchs operators acting on the integrals considered. In the appendices, we give a constructive explanation for why our generalisation works. We find an $\epsilon$-form whose connection has at most simple poles. We compute for the first time a canonical form for the three-loop banana integral with two unequal masses.

## 6. Pure Chromo-Natural Inflation: Signatures of Particle Production from   Weak to Strong Backreaction

**Authors:** Ema Dimastrogiovanni, Matteo Fasiello, Alexandros Papageorgiou, Cristóbal Zenteno Gatica

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750v1)

**Summary:**

As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge sector. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from the CMB to laser interferometers. The gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future gravitational wave detectors.

## 7. CoMBolt-ITA, a Collective Model via relativistic Boltzmann equation in   Isotropization Time Approximation

**Authors:** S. F. Taghavi, S. M. A. Tabatabaee Mehr, F. Taghinavaz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17707v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17707v1)

**Summary:**

A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzman distribution. The spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework.

## 8. Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation

**Authors:** Baptiste Blachier, Christophe Ringeval

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17680v1)

**Summary:**

Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. We present a time-reversed approach to Stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. We solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations.

## 9. FRG analysis for relativistic BEC in arbitrary spatial dimensions

**Authors:** Fumio Terazaki, Kazuya Mameda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17668v1)

**Summary:**

A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) We investigate fluctuation effects on the BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.
