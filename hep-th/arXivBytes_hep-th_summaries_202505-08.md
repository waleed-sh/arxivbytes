## 0. Local uniqueness of the Black String with small circle size

**Authors:** Emma Albertini, Daniel Platt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04573v1)

**Summary:**

In this article we study uniqueness of the Black String, i.e. the product of 4-dimensional Schwarzschild space with a circle of length L. In arXiv:2410.20967, this was reduced to a non-linear elliptic PDE, and we use this setup to show that for small L the BlackString is infinitesimally rigid as a Ricci-flat metric. Using a fixed point theorem, we prove that this implies local uniqueness.

## 1. Assessing the Reconstruction of the Critical Line in the QCD Phase   Diagram from Imaginary to Real Chemical Potential

**Authors:** Fabrizio Murgana, Marco Ruggieri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04569v1)

**Summary:**

We test a technique adopted in the lattice simulations framework, to reconstruct the chiral-phase boundary at real chemical potential. We use a low-energy effective model, the Quark-Meson model, both in the mean-field approximation and within the Functional Renormalization Group. We find a discrepancy between the actual phase boundary and the one pbtained via extrapolatin of $\approx150\%$. Therefore, our results show that the location of the critical endpoint obtained via reconstruction from imaginary $\mu$ should be considered with due caution.

## 2. Attracting without being attracted: Dark Matter as an aether wind

**Authors:** Raymond Isichei, Joao Magueijo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the possibility that part of what we call dark matter may be the mark of a preferred frame. In the non-relativistic limit this appears as a deviant matter source capable of attracting normal matter, but not feeling the attraction from other forms of matter or from itself. While this implies a violation of momentum conservation, no logical inconsistencies arise in this deviant ''Newtonian'' limit. In contrast, due to Bianchi identities, the relativistic theory must undergo core change.

## 3. Hot Holographic 2-flavor Quark Star

**Authors:** Le-Feng Chen, Jing-Yi Wu, Hao Feng, Tian-Shun Chen, Kilar Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04477v1)

**Summary:**

Quark star cores have been constructed. The mass range of the whole stars spans from $2$ to $17$ solar masses. This result allow them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. We illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.

## 4. The relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production   experiments

**Authors:** Álvaro Álvarez-Domínguez, Álvaro Parra-López

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04473v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04473v1)

**Summary:**

Analog gravity experiments often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the universe. These experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.

## 5. Warming up the Fibres

**Authors:** Dibya Chakraborty, Rudnei O. Ramos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04447v1)

**Summary:**

Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models.

## 6. Normal mode analysis within relativistic massive transport

**Authors:** Xin Lin, Qiu-Ze Sun, Xin-Hui Wu, Jin Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04444v1)

**Summary:**

One intriguing feature of massive transport is the coupling of the secular equations between the sound and heat channels. This coupling vanishes as the mass approaches zero. By utilizing the argument principle in complex analysis, we determine the existence condition for collective modes and find the onset transition behavior of collective modes previously observed in massless systems. We numerically determine the critical wavenumber for the existence of each mode under various values of the scaled mass. We find that the branch cut structure responsible for Landau damping differs significantly from the massless case.

## 7. Topological regular black holes without Cauchy horizon

**Authors:** Marco Calzá, Massimiliano Rinaldi, Sergio Zerbini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04427v1)

**Summary:**

Regular and spherically symmetric black holes that solve the singularity problems of the Schwarzschild solution are phenomenologically viable at large distance. But they usually suffer from the Cauchy horizon instability. To overcome this drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal horizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally symmetric spacetimes. We show that both these black holes can be constructed without Cauy horizons and without curvature singularities, thereby avoiding the mass inflation instability.

## 8. Charged Vortex in Superconductor

**Authors:** Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, Hanwool Song

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04359v1)

**Summary:**

We show that regular static vortex solutions are obtained only for the nonzero critical cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar fields. Since the Coulombic electric field is exactly cancelled by the phonon, the obtained charged vortices have finite energy. When the quartic self-interaction coupling ofcomplex scalar field has the critical value, the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound is saturated for multiple charged vortedices of arbitrary separations.

## 9. Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries IV: Einstein-Yang-Mills Theory

**Authors:** Nicolas Cresto, Laurent Freidel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04327v1)

**Summary:**

We show that there exist symmetry parameters that satisfy a collection of dual equations of motion. These allow the construction of an infinite collection of charges that are conserved in the absence of radiation. These Noether charges act on the Einstein Yang-Mills phase space canonically and non-linearly. Their action defines a symmetry algebroid which reduces to a symmetry algebra at non-radiative cuts. The corresponding symmetry bracket is shown to satisfy the Jacobi identity and an interesting cross-product structure, which is analyzed in details.

## 10. On local fields invariant under the action of topological defects

**Authors:** Anatoly Konechny, Vasileios Vergioglou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04316v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look into the problem of constructing and classifying pairs consisting of a local operator and a topological defect which commutes or anticommutes with it. In the case of the charge conjugation modular invariant commuting configurations in each problem can be obtained when a certain restriction on the fusion rules in realised. We obtain a full solution to this problem for the WZW theory, thus constructing a class of commuting boundary operators and junctions in that theory.

## 11. Relativistic structure of a supermassive black hole embedded in the dark   matter halo of NGC 4649 (M60)

**Authors:** Francisco S. N. Lobo, Jorde A. A. Ramos, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60) We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications.

## 12. Heisenberg Uncertainty Inequality and Breaking of Isospin Symmetry in   Atomic Nuclei

**Authors:** Sandro Stringari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04191v1)

**Summary:**

The inequality reduces to an identity if one employs a simplified mean field expression for the isovector component of the Coulomb force in first order perturbation theory. We show that the inequality provides an insightful connection between the violation of parity and isospin symmetries. The uncertainty inequality is also employed to derive an upper bound to theIsovector dipole moment in terms of the amount ofIsospin impurities in $N=Z$ atomic nuclei. The Heisenberg uncertainty inequality can also be used to derive a rigorous lower bound on the amount of isospin impurities caused by the violation of parity.

## 13. Discontinuity Method for Evaluating Scattering Amplitudes within the   Worldline Formalism

**Authors:** Victor Miguel Banda Guzmán

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04157v1)

**Summary:**

The worldline formalism offers an alternative framework to the standard diagrammatic approach in quantum field theory. The method involves decomposing an $n$-point one loop amplitude in $D=4$ dimensions into a linear combination of tadpole, bubble, triangle, and box master integrals. Each master integral exhibits a characteristic discontinuity with respect to a specific kinematic invariant. The rational coefficients can be determined by directly computing the discontinuities of the corresponding worldline master Integrals.

## 14. Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study   with Unruh-DeWitt detectors

**Authors:** Shunichiro Kinoshita, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04086v1)

**Summary:**

Researchers have proposed a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal conditions of an inflationARY universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantumField theory in curved spacetimes.
