## 0. Novel methodology to obtain transonic solutions for dissipative flows   around compact objects

**Authors:** Shilpa Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24839v1)

**Summary:**

A unified methodology to obtain accretion as well as wind solutions around these objects has been presented. Flows around compact objects are dissipative, and the conservation equations are therefore stiff. The methodology developed utilises the inner boundary conditions and takes recourse to implicit-explicit (ImEx) integration schemes, to obtain general global transonic accretion and wind solutions. This is the first time such an attempt has been made. This methodology could successfully generate all topologies of global solutions, multiple sonic point regime, and shocks.

## 1. Wess-Zumino-Witten Interactions of Axions: Three-Flavor

**Authors:** Yang Bai, Ting-Kuo Chen, Jia Liu, Xiaolin Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24822v1)

**Summary:**

We present a complete Lagrangian describing axion interactions with pseudoscalar and (axial-) vector mesons within the three light-flavor quark framework. By including instanton effects associated with the anomalous $U(1)_A$ symmetry, we demonstrate that physical observables remain invariant under arbitrary chiral phase rotations of the quark fields. We compute the decay widths of GeV-scale axions into various mesonic final states for several benchmark axion models.

## 2. The Quintom theory of dark energy after DESI DR2

**Authors:** Yifu Cai, Xin Ren, Taotao Qiu, Mingzhe Li, Xinmin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24732v1)

**Summary:**

 Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $Lambda$CDM paradigm. Dark energy evolves across $w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. We present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintum fields with ordinary matter and the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.

## 3. Elliptic Calogero-Sutherland model and conformal field theory

**Authors:** Edwin Langmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24700v1)

**Summary:**

In a project with Gordon Semenoff on 1+1 dimensional QCD many years ago, we stumbled over a method to solve Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models using gauge theories. Since then, these models have reappeared in different forms in many of my research projects. In this contribution, I describe a recent such project where a second quantization of the elliptic CalogERO-S Sutherland model led us to a new soliton equation and a non-relativistic variant of the Coleman correspondence.

## 4. Cohomotopy and flux quantization in $M$-theory

**Authors:** Daniel Grady

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24696v1)

**Summary:**

We identify some of the $k$-invariants for the Postnikov tower of the stable and unstable 4-sphere. We use the resulting obstruction theory to prove that the Chern--Simons term in the effective action of M-theory is well defined. In particular, we do not assume the presence of an $E_8$-gauge field. We conclude that we have found a way to solve the mystery of the 4-Sphere's structure.

## 5. Sphere amplitudes and observing the universe's size

**Authors:** Andreas Blommaert, Adam Levine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24633v1)

**Summary:**

Sine dilaton gravity is holographically related to DSSYK. This paves the way for using two copies of D SSYK as hologram for Big-Bang cosmologies. The sphere amplitude also gives a prediction for the universe's size. In the context of slow-roll inflation, the no-boundary state is non-normalizable, and predicts a small universe, in contradiction with experiments. We argue that an avatar of these issues exists in dS JT gravity. We then consider the observer's no- boundary state and show that this prefers neither small nor large universes.

## 6. Covariant diffusion and drift of the stochastic GW background with LISA

**Authors:** Giorgio Mentasti, Arad Nasiri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24620v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24620v1)

**Summary:**

This model introduces a stochastic correction to the massless geodesic equation while preserving Lorentz invariance. It is dominant at lower frequencies due to the larger spacetime support of long-wavelength modes. The effect is phenomenologically described by just two diffusion and drift parameters, whose values are already constrained by measurements of the CMB blackbody spectrum. detecting a GW background sourced by realistic models of first-order phase transitions or primordial black holes can constrain the parameters down to a value of $kappa_1$

## 7. Heavy mesons in an effective quark model with a nonlocal interaction

**Authors:** A. Friesen, Yu. Kalinovsky, A. Khmelev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24542v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the properties of light and heavy mesons in the framework of a model with nonlocal interaction. We start from the Bethe-Salpeter equation, choosing the interaction kernel in a nonlocal form with the Gaussian meson vertex function. We fix the model parameters using electromagnetic and leptonic decay constants. Finally, we reproduce the radiative decays of the $\rho$-meson and heavy quarkonia. We consider the neutral pion transition form factor and apply it to the transition form factors of heavy pseudoscalar mesons.

## 8. Predictability of quantum observables: Applications in QKD and top   quarks

**Authors:** Dennis I. Mart√≠nez-Moreno, Miguel Castillo-Celeita, Diego G. Bussandri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502v1)

**Summary:**

We quantify and optimize the predictability of local observables in bipartite quantum systems. We minimize these quantities when the prediction is improved by an additional quantum system. We embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, yielding asymptotically higher secure-key rates than standard BB84 under realistic noise. We applied these results to Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and spin correlation in top-antitop quark pairs from high-energy collisions.

## 9. A Unified Scale Factor for the Cosmic Evolution -Motivated by Brane   World Models-

**Authors:** Farzin Safarzadeh-Maleki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24420v1)

**Summary:**

This paper introduces a novel cosmological scale factor as a strong candidate for effectively modeling the universe. We provide a detailed analysis, supported by graphical representations of the universe's evolution with smooth transition from the early inflation to the present acceleration expansion. We explore the theoretical foundations of this model within extra-dimensional physics, demonstrating its compatibility with the brane-world paradigm. Through analytical approximations, the model describes a natural transition from a high-energy early universe to the low-energy regime governed by general relativity. It offers a compelling narrative of cosmic evolution across disparate energy scales.

## 10. Complex wave functions, CPT and quantum field theory for classical   generalized Ising models

**Authors:** Christof Wetterich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24392v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models. We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugated ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$) A subclass of generalized Ised models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistically initial conditions. For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations. For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing.

## 11. GPU Implementation of Zippel Method for Feynman Integral Reconstruction

**Authors:** Alexander V. Smirnov, Boris I. Rozhnov, Vadim V. Voevodin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24256v1)

**Summary:**

The Zippel algorithm performs a rational reconstruction of multivariate polynomials. It is applied in different fields of science, lately becoming an important step in Feynman integral reduction in elementary particle physics. In some cases with multiple variables it might become a bottleneck for the whole evaluation so that different optimizations are required. In this paper we describe how we ported the classical Zipple algorithm together with its balanced version for rational functions to graphical processor units and perform its evaluation on several GPUs.

## 12. Forms of BRST symmetry on a Prototypical First-Class System

**Authors:** Sumit Kumar Rai, Bhabani Prasad Mandal, Ronaldo Thibes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24233v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain the various forms of BRST symmetry by using the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism in a prototypical first class system. The so called "dual-BRST" symmetry is claimed to be an independent symmetry due to its roots in differential geometry. It is obtained by making a canonical transformation in the ghost sector. We have shown that the various form of symmetry can be obtained through canonical transformed in theghost sector. It can also be shown that this transformation can be used to obtain different forms of symmetry.

## 13. Critical slowing down of black hole phase transition and kinetic   crossover in supercritical regime

**Authors:** Ran Li, Kun Zhang, Jiayue Yang, Robert B. Mann, Jin Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24148v1)

**Summary:**

Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-Anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) black holes in the extended phase space exhibit critical behavior analogous to the liquid-gas system. However, the kinetics of these transitions near spinodal and critical points remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that both the autocorrelation time and the variance of trajectories increase significantly as the system approaches these special points, signaling critical slowing down. This behavior is driven by the flattening of the free energy landscape, as confirmed by the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker-Planck equation.

## 14. A Criterion for Magnetars Producing Giant Flares

**Authors:** Y. Meng, Q. -S. Zhang, J. Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24128v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, the straight flux rope in the model of giant flares on magnetars was replaced with a curved one. Two footpoints of the flux rope are anchored to the spherical surface of magnetar. Changes in the background environment drive the configuration to evolve through a set of equilibria in a quasi-static fashion until the critical point is reached and the loss of equilibrium in the configuration occurs, invoking a giant flare. We establish a criterion to identify magnetars capable of producing giant flares.

## 15. The Special Locus

**Authors:** Tobi Ramella, Nicholas P. Warner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24087v1)

**Summary:**

The special locus plays an important role in the construction of the non-BPS microstate geometries known as microstrata. Because supersymmetry is broken the anomalous dimensions of these states are not protected. In this paper we reveal the supergravity structure of the special Locus, first in three-dimensional supergravity and then in the uplift to six dimensions and IIB supergravity. The key insight is that, in three dimensions, a family of dual vector fields must vanish, and this implies there are algebraic relations between tensor gauge fields in six and ten dimensions.
