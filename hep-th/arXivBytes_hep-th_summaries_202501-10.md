## 0. Fortuity in the D1-D5 system

**Authors:** Chi-Ming Chang, Ying-Hsuan Lin, Haoyu Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05448v1)

**Summary:**

We reformulate the lifting problem in the D1-D5 CFT as a supercharge cohomology problem. We enumerate BPS states according to the fortuitous/monotone classification. We interpret their holographic duals as black hole bound states and massive stringy excitations on smooth horizonless (e.g. Lunin-Mathur) geometries. For general $N$, an infinite set of monotone cohomological classes are characterized and conjectured to be exhaustive.

## 1. Quantization of Holomorphic Symplectic Manifolds: Analytic Continuation   of Path Integrals and Coherent States

**Authors:** Joshua Lackman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05428v1)

**Summary:**

We extend Berezin's quantization to holomorphic symplectic manifolds. We allow the states to be points in the cotangent bundle of a Grassmanian. We also define a holomorphic path integral quantization as a certain idempotent in a convolution algebra and we prove that these two quantizations are equivalent. Related to this, we show that the cotsangent bundles of Grassmanians have commuting almost complex structures that are compatible with a holomorphlectic form.

## 2. Entropy flow in a parametric amplifier

**Authors:** Sergei Khlebnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05397v1)

**Summary:**

 Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra, there is a useful definition of entropy flow. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the Off-Diagonal Coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to Gaussian environments.

## 3. Bifurcations in Bosonic Stars: chains and rings from spherical solutions

**Authors:** Chen Liang, Carlos A. R. Herdeiro, Eugen Radu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342v1)

**Summary:**

We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic stars. We discover that excited state spherical bosonic. stars b ifurcate into two types of axisymetric bosonics. We have constructed chains of scalar bosonicStars with 7 constituents and their corresponding ring-like scalar Bosonic stars for the first time. Our results provide an explanation for the bIfurcations in bosonic star from the perspective of perturbations.

## 4. Shedding Light on Naked Singularities

**Authors:** Franco Fiorini, Santiago Hernandez, Juan Manuel Paez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05306v1)

**Summary:**

Electromagnetic waves propagating in the background provided by a spacetime hosting a strong curvature, naked singularity, are fully studied. In some of them, the singularity operates as a perfect mirror reflecting the surrounding fields. Strikingly, other solutions exhibit a perfectly well behaved, bounded power flux as they propagate towards the singularities, suggesting thus the possibility of having electromagnetic energy transference through it. The analysis is performed not only in the realm of geometrical optics, but also in the physical one in which field amplitudes must necessarily be incorporated into the description.

## 5. Scalar Field Action under 4D Isotropic Cut-off and its Cosmological   Impact

**Authors:** A. Aynbund, V. V. Kiselev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05274v1)

**Summary:**

 Specific action for isotropic fluctuations of scalar field is derived under the condition of 4D cut-off. It is implemented into the estimates of dark energy scale consistent with current cosmological data. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Light, published by the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2010. It was the first of its kind and is based on data from the Large Hadron Collider, which has been around since the 1940s. It has been published in a book called Astrophysical Theories of Light.

## 6. General expression for three-loop $Î²$-functions of $\cal N =$ 1   supersymmetric theories with multiple gauge couplings regularized by higher   covariant derivatives

**Authors:** Olesya Haneychuk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05174v1)

**Summary:**

For supersymmetric theories with multiple gauge couplings, a general expression for three-loop gauge $\beta$-functions is obtained. It is demonstrated that in the particular case of MSSM, it precisely reproduces the known expressions found earlier in another way. For the case where Yukawa couplings are absent, similar expressions are also obtained in terms of the renormalized couplings in an arbitrary subtraction scheme and, in particular, in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme.

## 7. Hierarchies from deterministic non-locality in theory space Anderson   localisation

**Authors:** Ketan M. Patel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05137v1)

**Summary:**

The nearest-neighbour or local mass terms in theory space among quantum fields, with their generic disordered values, are known to lead to the localisation of mass eigenstates. This mechanism can be used to create an exponential hierarchy in the coupling between two fields by placing them at opposite ends of the lattice chain. We show that when copies of such fields are appropriately attached to the lattices chain, it leads to the emergence of multiple massless modes. These vanishing masses are a direct consequence of the locality of interactions in Theory space.

## 8. Many body gravity and the bullet cluster

**Authors:** S. Ganesh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126v1)

**Summary:**

Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS) The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients. MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark Matter.

## 9. Duality, asymptotic charges and algebraic topology in mixed symmetry   tensor gauge theories

**Authors:** Federico Manzoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05104v1)

**Summary:**

In a recent paper the duality map between electric-like asymptotic charges of $p$-form gauge theories is studied. The outcome is an existence and uniqueness theorem. The goal of this work is to extend that theorem in the case of mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories. The crucial points are to view a mixed symmetry Tensor as a Young projected object of the $N$-multi-form space. As a result, if the underlying manifold satisfy appropriate conditions, the dualy map can be proven to exist.

## 10. Resummations for Inflationary Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** R. P. Woodard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05077v1)

**Summary:**

The continual production of gravitons during inflation endows loop corrections with secular logarithms which grow nonperturbatively large during a prolonged period of inflation. The physics behind these effects is reviewed, along with a catalog of the examples which have so far been found. Resummation can be accomplished by combining a variant of Starobinsky's stochastic formalism with a variant. of the renormalization group. The issue of gauge independence is also addressed, as well as the physics behind it.

## 11. Brane Cosmology from AdS/BCFT

**Authors:** Kosei Fujiki, Hiroki Kanda, Michitaka Kohara, Tadashi Takayanagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05036v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the time-dependent dynamics of an end-of-the-world (EOW) brane in AdS with a scalar field localized on the brane. We find that our brane cosmology model can describe a process of creating a universe via a big-bang. We also obtain brane solutions with boost symmetry, which are obtained by analytical continuation of Euclidean branes with a torus topology. And then we classify all possible solutions of the branes when the potential takes a constant value.
