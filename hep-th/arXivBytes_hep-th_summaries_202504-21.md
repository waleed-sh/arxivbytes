## 0. On Refined Vogel's universality

**Authors:** Liudmila Bishler, Andrei Mironov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13831v1)

**Summary:**

In accordance with P. Vogel, a set of algebra structures in Chern-Simons theory can be made universal, independent of a particular family of simple Lie algebras. We support this conjecture by analysing the Macdonald dimensions, i.e. values of Macdonald polynomials at $q^\rho$, where $\rho$ is the Weyl vector. There is a universality formula that describes these dimensions for the simply laced algebraes as a function on the Vogel's plane.

## 1. Modular Hamiltonian of holographic time band states

**Authors:** Xin-Xiang Ju, Bo-Hao Liu, Ya-Wen Sun, Yang Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13739v1)

**Summary:**

A holographic time band is a causal incomplete boundary spacetime subregion. In an AdS$_3$ spacetime with a specifically modified IR geometry, its causal wedge coincides with its entanglement wedge, which suggests the existence of a local modular Hamiltonian. This is a substantial addition to the known holographic subsystems with a local reversible Hamiltonian, beyond the few cases previously identified. The entangler first law has also been checked to hold for the simplest time band state.

## 2. High Energy String Theory and the Celestial Sphere

**Authors:** Xavier Kervyn, Stephan Stieberger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13738v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate on a string world-sheet connection to flat space-time holography. We show that this picture continues to hold at all subleading orders in the quantum fluctuations around this classical configuration. As a consequence there is a dual description of the high energy limit of string theory as the large energy expansion on the celestial sphere organized by (light) higher spin modes. This approach points to an intrinsic construction of celestial conformal field theory (CFT) by relating it to a (free) world-sheets CFT.

## 3. Bubble wall dynamics from nonequilibrium quantum field theory

**Authors:** Wen-Yuan Ai, Matthias Carosi, Bjorn Garbrecht, Carlos Tamarit, Miguel Vanvlasselaer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13725v1)

**Summary:**

The commonly used equation of motion of the bubble wall in the kinetic approach is shown to be incomplete. We identify an additional dissipative friction which is contributed by particle production processes from the condensate-particle type vertices. We also show how other transmission processes beyond the 1-to-1 elementary transmission studied in the literature for ultrarelativistic bubble walls can be understood from a kinetic approach. The kinetic approach can be used to understand the dynamics of bubble walls in a plasma.

## 4. Bubble wall velocity from Kadanoff-Baym equations: fluid dynamics and   microscopic interactions

**Authors:** Michael J. Ramsey-Musolf, Jiang Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13724v1)

**Summary:**

We establish a first principles, systematic framework for determining the bubble wall velocity during a first order cosmological phase transition. This framework, based on non-local Kadanoff-Baym equations, incorporates both macroscopic fluid dynamics and microscopic interactions. We apply this framework to compute the new friction force arising from the $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering processes in scalar field theory. We obtain a linear relationship between this force and the Lorentz factor $gamma_w$ that would preclude runaway bubbles with such effects.

## 5. Two faces of $N=7,8$ superconformal mechanics

**Authors:** Sergey Krivonos, Armen Nersessian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13651v1)

**Summary:**

Two variants of $N=7$ superconformal mechanics with manifest $so(7)$ and $su(2)$ $R$-symmetries possessing exceptional $G(3)$ dynamical symmetry are presented. We developed two new versions of covariant embedding of the exceptional $g_2$ algebra into the $so (7) $ algebra. The constants of the octonion multiplication play a key role in the construction of the mechanics.

## 6. Analytic approaches to anisotropic holographic superfluids in   asymptotically hyperscaing viloation geometry

**Authors:** Gitae Kim, Yeong Seok Choi, Jae-Hyuk Oh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13635v1)

**Summary:**

In arXiv:hep-th/1109.4592, the authors obtained such an analytic solution in 5-dimensional Einstein-SU(2)Yang-Mills system, and it is asymptotically AdS$_5$. What is more in this note is that we get analytic solutions near the critical point in 3- and 4- dimensional Einstein-Scalar-U(1)$\times$SU( 2)YangMills systems. We also get leading order back reactions to the background geometry to show spatial anisotropy of the bulk geometry.

## 7. Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the   Absolute Magnitude

**Authors:** Jing-Yi Jia, Jia-Lei Niu, Da-Chun Qiang, Hao Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380v1)

**Summary:**

The Hubble tension is the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.
