## 0. The Toda-Weyl mass spectrum

**Authors:** Martin T. Luu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06732v1)

**Summary:**

The masses of affine Toda theories are known to correspond to the entries of a Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the relevant Cartan matrix. The Lagrangian of the theory can be expressed in terms of a suitable eigen vector of a Coxeter element in the Weyl group. We generalize this set-up by formulating Lagrangians based on eigenvectors of arbitrary elements. Under some technical conditions (that hold for many Weyl Group elements), we calculate the classical mass spectrum.

## 1. Twists of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory in Topological String Theory

**Authors:** Philsang Yoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06647v1)

**Summary:**

We show that every twist of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group GL(N) can be realized as an open-string field theory in topological string theory. Our approach reinterprets twists of supersymphony Yang-mills theory as generalized Chern-Simons theories. We identify topologicalstring backgrounds that produce the corresponding Chern- Simons theories, and show how they can be combined to form a new type of string field theory.

## 2. Mapping luminous and dark matter in the Universe

**Authors:** Nora Elisa Chisari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06644v1)

**Summary:**

Our standard model of the Universe predicts the distribution of dark matter to $1\%$ at the scales needed for upcoming experiments. Yet our predictions for how the luminous matter -which has interactions besides gravity- is distributed remain highly uncertain. Understanding how much gas and stars there are in the Universe and where they preferentially live is challenging. I will describe how our efforts to model luminous and dark matter jointly will create new possibilities for constraining the physics of supermassive black holes, galaxies, and gas over time.

## 3. Larmor radiation as a witness to the Unruh effect

**Authors:** Atsushi Higuchi, George E. A. Matsas, Daniel A. T. Vanzella, Robert Bingham, Joao P. B. Brito, Luis C. B. Crispino, Gianluca Gregori, Georgios Vacalis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06630v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the emission of radiation from general sources in quantum scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields using the Rindler coordinate frame. In particular, we point out that, to recover the usual Larmor radiation in the interaction picture, it is necessary to incorporate the Unruh effect. The observation of classical L armor radiation could be seen as vindicating the UnRuh effect in the sense that it is not correctly reproduced in this context unless the Un Ruh effect is taken into account.

## 4. Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a   Mass Quench

**Authors:** Federico Rottoli, Michele Mazzoni, Fabio Sailis, Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06612v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06612v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques. The symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetric resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.

## 5. The reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector

**Authors:** Si-Wei Han, Wenjing Chen, Langxuan Chen, Zhichun Ouyang, Jun Feng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation.

## 6. Consistency Problems of Conformal Killing Gravity

**Authors:** Emel Altas, Bayram Tekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06262v1)

**Summary:**

Gravity field equations based on a tensor with rank greater than 2 have consistency problems. Conformal Killing Gravity, an interesting extension of General Relativity, is plagued with this problem. In this theory, it is not clear at all how one can define the energy and angular momentum for black hole solutions, or define the analogues of the formulas, such as the quadrupole formula, in the weak field limit for gravitational waves emitted by compact sources. We show that gravity field equations with a rank-3 tensor field equation that does not arise from a diffeomorphism-invariant action are not consistent.

## 7. Family Unification in $SO(16)$ Grand Unification

**Authors:** Cheng-Wei Chiang, Tianjun Li, Naoki Yamatsu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06088v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06088v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a unified model for the three Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetries and $SU(3)$ family symmetry based on $SO(16)$ grand unified gauge symmetry on six-dimensional (6D) spacetime. In this model, three chiral generations of quarks and leptons are unified into a 6D Weyl fermion in the spinor representation of $SO('16')$. The 6D $SO'16' gauge anomaly is canceled by the vectorlike nature of the model.
