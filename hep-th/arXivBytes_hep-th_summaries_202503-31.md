## 0. R-matrix valued Lax pair for elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system and   associative Yang-Baxter equations of ${\rm BC}_n$ type

**Authors:** M. Matushko, A. Mostovskii, A. Zotov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22659v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system with five arbitrary constants. We propose $R$-matrix valued generalization for $2n\times 2n$ Takasaki's Lax pair. As a by-product we also propose a generalization of the XYZ long-range spin chain. We present arguments pointing to the integrability of this type of generalization. We conclude with an argument for the existence of a new type of elliptic system.

## 1. Physics-informed gauge theories

**Authors:** Friederike Ihssen, Jan M. Pawlowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22638v1)

**Summary:**

We use the physics-informed renormalisation group (PIRG) for the construction of gauge-invariant flows. We apply this approach to Yang-Mills theory and gravity and show how the flowing gauge fields arrange for full gauge invariance. We also embed the background field approximation to the functional renormalization group (fRG) in an exact gauge invariant PIRG flow. This allows us to discuss the dynamics of the correction terms, and the non-trivial ultraviolet or infrared relevant terms are elucidated within a one-loop approximation.

## 2. Contact diagrams for chords

**Authors:** Yiyang Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22619v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22619v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate how contact chord diagrams can arise from certain Fock-space models. We compute the corresponding correlation functions using the chord path integral technique. In particular, our three-point functions are in the right form dictated by conformal symmetry. Some of our four-point diagrams match the results of some AdS$_2$ contact Witten diagrams. We conclude by showing how to compute the correlation functions for certain contact chord diagram models and their corresponding contact chord chord diagrams. The results are shown in the figure below.

## 3. Quantum Entropy-Driven Modifications to Holographic Dark Energy in   $f(G,T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22609v1)

**Summary:**

We present a $f(G,T)$ gravity-based reconstruction of Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) This approach extends the conventional HDE model by replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with Barrow entropy. We explore the dynamics of a flat FRW background filled with a pressureless dust fluid. In the case of conserved energy-momentum tensor, our findings indicate that the BHDE model evolves from a quintessence-like regime into the phantom domain.

## 4. Integrable Corners in the Space of Gukov-Witten Surface Defect

**Authors:** Adam Chalabi, Charlotte Kristjansen, Chenliang Su

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22598v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22598v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate integrability properties of Gukov-Witten 1/2-BPS surface defects in $SU(N)$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in the large-$N$ limit. We demonstrate that ordinary Gukov/Witten defects, which depend on a set of continuous parameters, are not integrable except for special sub-sectors. In contrast, rigid Gukov Witten defects appear integrable in a corner of the discrete parameter space.

## 5. Bootstrapping Classical Spinning Compton Amplitudes with   Colour-Kinematics

**Authors:** Ingrid Vazquez-Holm, Andres Luna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22597v1)

**Summary:**

We set up a procedure to systematically obtain Compton-like amplitudes in an arbitrary-spin theory. We exploit their factorization properties, and colour-kinematics duality. We furthermore investigate the constraining of Wilson coefficients for arbitrary spinning bodies and its relation to colour-kinsematic duality, as well as their relation to Compton- like amplitudes. We conclude with a discussion of the effects of the Compton effect on the spin of an arbitrary spinning body on the Compton amplitudes of a spinning body.

## 6. Higher-order $p$-form asymptotic symmetries in $D = p + 2$

**Authors:** Federico Manzoni, Matteo Romoli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22572v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22572v1)

**Summary:**

We identify $N + 1$ independent asymptotic charges, with each charge being parametrised by an arbitrary function of the angular variables. By means of the Hodge decomposition, these charges share the same formal structure independently from p and are manifestly dual to a scalar charge. We work in Lorenz gauge, therefore the gauge parameters require a radial expansion involving logarithmic (subleading) terms to ensure nontrivial angular dependence at leading order. At the same time we assume a power expansion for the field strength.

## 7. To CPL, or not to CPL? What we have not learned about the dark energy   equation of state

**Authors:** Savvas Nesseris, Yashar Akrami, Glenn D. Starkman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22529v1)

**Summary:**

Using a Taylor expansion for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter adds extra information not present in the data. Fixing the higher-order terms to zero, one concludes that vacuum energy that is currently non-dynamical (e.g., the cosmological constant) is excluded as the explanation of cosmic acceleration. Instead marginalizing over the higher order terms shows that we know neither the current dark energy equations of state nor its current rate of change well enough to make such a claim. The results of analyses using simple Taylor expansions should be interpreted with great care.

## 8. NEC violation and "beyond Horndeski'' physics in light of DESI DR2

**Authors:** Gen Ye, Yong Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22515v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22515v1)

**Summary:**

Recent DESI DR2 results provide compelling evidence that the dark energy equation of state evolves from $w<-1$ at high redshift to $w>-1 $ today. While NEC violation may be crucial for dark energy and solving the cosmological singularity problem, it generically leads to ghost or gradient instabilities. This finding suggests an unexpected possible connection between the primordial Universe and the late observable Universe. It is well established in the study of nonsingular cosmology that the effective field theory (EFT) operator enables fully stable NEC violation.

## 9. Anomalous dimensions for exclusive processes

**Authors:** S. Van Thurenhout

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22495v1)

**Summary:**

We give an overview of recent developments in the computation of the anomalous dimension matrix of composite operators in non-forward kinematics. The elements of this matrix set the evolution of non-perturbative parton distributions such as the generalized parton distribution functions. The latter provide important information about hadronic structure and are accessible experimentally in hard exclusive scattering processes. We focus our discussion on a recent method that exploits consistency relations for anomalous dimensions which follow from the renormalization structure of quark and gluon operators.

## 10. Asymptotically safe canonical quantum gravity: Gaussian dust matter

**Authors:** Renata Ferrero, Thomas Thiemann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22474v1)

**Summary:**

In the present contribution we consider gravity coupled to Gaussian dust matter. This is a generally covariant Lorentzian signature system. The field theory version correctly accounts for geometry -- matter backreaction and thus in principle serves as a dark matter model. The intuitive geometric interpretation selects a preferred reference frame that allows to disentangle gauge degrees of freedom from observables. The CQG treatment of this theory has already been considered in the past. For this particular matter content it is possible to formulate the quantum field theory of observables as a non-linear $\sigma$ model.

## 11. Casimir pressure with dissipation and quantum corrections from axion   dark matter

**Authors:** Philippe Brax, Pierre Brun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22412v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22412v1)

**Summary:**

We study the effects of the oscillating axion field present in our environment on the Casimir pressure between two metallic plates. We take into account the finite conductivity of the boundary plates and model the interactions between matter and photons in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We then compute the leading correction to the Lifschitz theory in inverse powers of the axion suppression scale and show that theCasimir pressure receives oscillating corrections depending on the product of theAxion mass and the distance between the plates.

## 12. Invariant Differential Operators for the Real Exceptional Lie Algebra   $F'_4$

**Authors:** V. K. Dobrev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22407v1)

**Summary:**

In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of invariant differential operators. We consider induction from a maximal parabolic algebra. We classify the reducible Verma modules over $F_4$ which are compatible with this induction. Thus, we obtain the classification of the corresponding invariant differential operators. We conclude that $F'_4=F_{4(4)$ is a split real form of the exceptional Lie algebra $F-4.

## 13. Colour structure of next-to-eikonal Cwebs at three loops

**Authors:** Abhinava Danish, Shubham Mishra, Sourav Pal, Aditya Srivastav, Anurag Tripathi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22376v1)

**Summary:**

Correlators of Wilson-line, which capture eikonal contributions, are known to exponentiate in non-abelian gauge theories. Their logarithms can be organised in terms of collections of Feynman diagrams called webs. In the present article we study next-to-eikonal Cwebs at three loop order, the order at which non trivial Cweb mixing matrices appear for the first time. The methods developed in this article are used to obtain the mixing matrixes for next- to-eikkonal C webs.

## 14. Heavy-quark corner of the Columbia plot from the center-symmetric   Curci-Ferrari model

**Authors:** V. Tomas Mari Surkau, Urko Reinosa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22373v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the heavy-quark corner of the Columbia plot using the gluon potential derived from the Curci-Ferrari extension of the Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing in the center-symmetric Landau gauge. We find that the main qualitative features of the phase structure are reproduced. Our results agree quantitatively with those of simulations to $10\%$ accuracy, which is the expected precision of the one-loop calculations in applications to Yang-Mills theories.

## 15. Axial perturbations of black holes with primary scalar hair

**Authors:** Christos Charmousis, Simon Iteanu, David Langlois, Karim Noui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22348v1)

**Summary:**

We study axial perturbations of static black holes with primary hair in a family of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. These solutions possess a scalar charge, fully independent of the mass, leading to a continuous one-parameter deformation of the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Using a WKB approximation, we compute the quasi-normal modes for the Schr\"odinger-like equation associated with the effective metric outside the gravitational horizon.

## 16. Transport coefficients of heavy quarks by elastic and radiative   scatterings in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma

**Authors:** Ilia Grishmanovskii, Taesoo Song, Carsten Greiner, Elena Bratkovskaya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22311v1)

**Summary:**

We extend our investigation of heavy quark transport coefficients in the effective dynamical quasiparticle model. We calculate various observables connected to a charm quark. We found that inelastic processes can play a significant role in the determination of the transport coefficients at large transverse momenta, but are strongly suppressed at low transversal momenta. We explore the mass dependence of the diffusion coefficient by comparing the results for charm quarks, bottom quark, and infinitely-heavy quarks.

## 17. Conformal Phase Transition in Supersymmetric QCD

**Authors:** Kohei Fujikura, Shota Nakagawa, Yuichiro Nakai, Peng Sun, Yufei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22293v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a four-dimensional supersymmetric QCD in conformal window with a marginally relevant deformation which triggers the spontaneous breaking of (approximate) scale invariance. We analyze the finite temperature system and show that the phase transition associated with the breaking of conformal invariance is of the strong first order. When such a phase transition takes place at a temperature of the Universe around the electroweak scale, it generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background probed by future space-based interferometers.

## 18. Influence of dark photon on magnetized and charged particle orbits   around static spherically symmetric black hole

**Authors:** Marek Rogatko, Paritosh Verma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22254v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22254v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate the problem of magnetized particle motion in the spacetime of a static, spherically symmetric black hole influenced by weak magnetic fields stemming from visible and dark matter sectors. The Wald's procedure for obtaining the weakly magnetized solution, generalized to the case of dark photon - Einstein-Maxwell gravity was implemented. The collision process analysis of two particles in the background of the black hole has been studied in order to find the signature of dark matter presence in the nearby of the object in question.

## 19. QCD thermodynamics with dynamical chiral fermions

**Authors:** Z. Fodor, A. Yu. Kotov, T. G. Kovacs, K. K. Szabo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22243v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss properties of thermal Quantum Chromodynamics obtained by means of lattice simulations with overlap fermions. This fermion discretisation preserves chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing. We determine the topological susceptibility from simulations at fixed global topological charge based on the slab method. The volume dependence of the chiral susceptibility is in agreement with the crossover nature of the thermal QCD phase transition. We discuss the spectrum of the overlap Dirac operator and its volume and temperature dependence. Presented results are obtained at the temporal lattice extent $N_t=8$.

## 20. Structure of Carrollian (conformal) superalgebra

**Authors:** Yu-fan Zheng, Bin Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22160v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate possible supersymmetric extensions of the Carrollian algebra. We identify multiple admissible structures, depending on the representations of the supercharges. Remarkably, neither of these constructions requires R-symmetry to ensure the algebraic closure. In the conformal case, we demonstrate that the nontrivial Carrollian superconformal algebras are isomorphic to super-Poincar\'e algebra of $d=5$ and $d-4$ respectively.

## 21. SU(3) centre vortex geometry at finite temperature

**Authors:** Jackson A. Mickley, Waseem Kamleh, Derek B. Leinweber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22153v1)

**Summary:**

Recent discovery of a second finite-temperature transition in QCD associated with quark deconfinement. This signals the presence of a new phase of ground-state field structure. In this short presentation, we re-examine pure SU(3) gauge theory which provides a foundation for the development of techniques for the examination of full QCD. We reconsider visualisations of the centre-vortex structure in light of the quantitative analysis that demonstrates the first order nature of the deconfinements phase transition in pure-gauge theory.

## 22. Crystalline Phases in QCD

**Authors:** Theo F. Motta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22085v1)

**Summary:**

Low-energy models of QCD have shown indications that a crystalline quark phase could be stable at high chemical potentials. Beyond models, there are numerous difficulties in investigating such a hypothesis in full QCD. Functional methods do not suffer from the sign problem, and thus, can access the high--$\mu$ side of the QCD phase diagram. In this talk, I show how the standard stability analysis was generalised to be applicable in any theory, including Q CD.
