## 0. Quantum Barcodes: Persistent Homology for Quantum Phase Transitions

**Authors:** Khyathi Komalan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10468v1)

**Summary:**

"Quantum barcodes" are a theoretical framework that applies persistent homology to classify topological phases in quantum many-body systems. By mapping quantum states to classical data points through strategic observable measurements, we create a "quantum state cloud" analyzable via persistenthomology techniques. Our framework establishes that quantum systems in the same topological phase exhibit consistent barcode representations with shared persistentHomology groups over characteristic intervals. We prove that quantum phase transitions manifest as significant changes in these persistent Homology features.

## 1. Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness

**Authors:** Andrea Mondino, Clemens Sämann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380v1)

**Summary:**

The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic LorentZian spaces or smooth spacetimes. The paper establishes several applications, including timelike blow-up tangents and connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory. It also shows that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorent zian Gromova-Husdorff convergence.

## 2. Minimal surfaces in strongly correlated random environments

**Authors:** Barbara Dembin, Dor Elboim, Ron Peled

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10379v1)

**Summary:**

A minimal surface in a random environment (MSRE) is a $d-dimensional surface in $(d+n)-dimensional space which minimizes the sum of its elastic energy and its environment potential energy. Such surfaces are motivated by connections with disordered spin systems and first-passage percolation models. We prove that surfaces of dimension $d=4$ delocalize with sub-power-law fluctuations, with their height and minimal energy fluctuations tied by a scaling relation.

## 3. The diagonal and Hadamard grade of hypergeometric functions

**Authors:** Andrew Harder, Joe Kramer-Miller

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10354v1)

**Summary:**

Diagonals of rational functions are an important class of functions arising in number theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and physics. In this paper we study the diagonal grade of a function $f$, defined to be the smallest $n$ such that $f$ is the diagonal of a rational function in variables $x_0,\dots, x_n$. We relate the diagonalGrade of afunction to the nilpotence of the associated differential equation. This allows us to determine the diagonalgrade of many hypergeometric functions.

## 4. Global existence of measure-valued solutions to the multicomponent   Smoluchowski coagulation equation

**Authors:** Marina A. Ferreira, Sakari Pirnes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10306v1)

**Summary:**

Global solutions to the multicomponent Smoluchowski coagulation equation are constructed for measure-valued initial data with minimal assumptions on the moments. The framework is based on an abstract formulation of the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem for uniform spaces. We also provide short proofs of mass-conservation and gelation results for any weak solution, which extends previous results for one- component systems. The result holds for a large class of coagulating rate kernels, satisfying a power-law upper bound with possibly different singularities.

## 5. Extended-BMS Anomalies and Flat Space Holography

**Authors:** Laurent Baulieu, Luca Ciambelli, Tom Wetzstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10304v1)

**Summary:**

We classify the Lagrangians and anomalies of an extended BMS field theory using BRST methods. We find that supertranslations are anomaly-free, while superrotations exhibit independent central charges. The absence of supertranslation anomalies aligns with Weinberg's soft graviton theorem being tree-level exact. This work provides a first-principle derivation of the structure of the null boundary field theory. It offers further evidence for the holographic principle in flat space, and its dimensional reduction.

## 6. Lagrangian averaging of singular stochastic actions for fluid dynamics

**Authors:** Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10177v1)

**Summary:**

We construct sub-grid scale models of incompressible fluids. We consider expectations of semi-martingale Lagrangian particle trajectories. We use Malliavin calculus to give a regularised interpretation of the product of white noise when inserting the stochastic velocity field into the Lagrangians for Euler's fluid. Finally, we consider closures of the mean velocity by making Stochastic analogues of Talyor's frozen-in turbulence hypothesis to derive a version of the anisotropic Lagrangia averaged Euler equation.

## 7. SEMPO - Retrieving poles, residues and zeros in the complex frequency   plane from an arbitrary spectral response

**Authors:** I. Ben Soltane, M. Roy, R. Andre, N. Bonod

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10176v1)

**Summary:**

SEMPO is a toolbox to extract the complex poles, zeros and residues of an arbitrary response function acquired along the real frequency axis. SEMPO allows to determine this full set of complex parameters of linear physical systems from their spectral responses only, without prior information about the system. The method leverages on the Singularity Expansion Method of the physical signal. This analytical expansion of the meromorphic function in the complex frequency plane motivates the use of the Cauchy method and auto-differentiation-based optimization approach.

## 8. Regularization of Functional Determinants of Radial Operators via Heat   Kernel Coefficients

**Authors:** Yutaro Shoji, Masahide Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10099v1)

**Summary:**

We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate the large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants. In the limit of a big angular momentum, our formulas reduce to the WKB formulas in previous studies, but extended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta function regularization and the dimensional regularization. We propose an efficient regularization method forfunctional determinants of radial operators using heat kernel coefficient. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernels expansion.

## 9. Analyzing reduced density matrices in SU(2) Chern-Simons theory

**Authors:** Atesh Saini, Siddharth Dwivedi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10098v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the reduced density matrices obtained for the quantum states in the context of 3d Chern-Simons theory. We show that the characteristic polynomials of these reduceddensity matrices are monic polynmials with rational coefficients. We focus on quantum states associated with the $T_{p,p}$ torus link complements, which is a $p$-party pure quantum state. The reduced densityMatrices are obtained by taking the $(1|p-1)$ bi-partition of the total system.

## 10. Cohomology ring of unitary $N=(2,2)$ full vertex algebra and mirror   symmetry

**Authors:** Yuto Moriwaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09919v1)

**Summary:**

The mirror symmetry among Calabi-Yau manifolds is mysterious. The mirror operation in 2d conformal field theory (SCFT) is an elementary operation. The cohomology rings determine 2d topological field theories and give relations between them (Hodge duality and T-duality) Based on this, we propose a possible approach to prove the existence of mirror Calabi/Yau manifolds for the Hodge numbers using SCFTs. The proof is still not rigorous, but expected properties are tested for the case of Abelian varieties and a special K3 surface.

## 11. Creation of chaos for interacting Brownian particles

**Authors:** Armand Bernou, Mitia Duerinckx, Matthieu Ménard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09917v1)

**Summary:**

In this model framework, we establish a fine version of the so-called creation-of-chaos phenomenon. In weak norms, the mean-field approximation for a typical particle is shown to hold with an accuracy $O(N^{-1})$ up to an error due solely to initial pair correlations. The novelty is that the initial information appears in our estimates only through pair correlations, which currently seems inaccessible to other methods. This is complemented by corresponding results on higher-order creation of chaos in the form of higher- order correlation estimates.

## 12. $q$-Deformed Heisenberg Picture Equation

**Authors:** Julio César Jaramillo Quiceno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09829v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we introduce the $q$-deformed Heisenberg picture equation. We consider some examples such as : the spinless particle, the electr\'on interaction with a magnnetic field. The $q $-Heisenberg equation for any dynamical function is presented at the end of the paper. It can be used to solve any of the following equations:  the $q $-Deformed Harmonnic Oscillator, the $q$$-Harmonic Oscillator or the $Q$$ Deformed Equation for the Spinless Particle.

## 13. Quantum theory from classical mechanics near equilibrium

**Authors:** Albert Schwarz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09806v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09806v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$ have a non-degenerate minimum at the point where generalized momenta $p$ and generalized coordinates $q$ vanish. In this situation, in the neighborhood of the point $p=0, q=0$ quadratic part of a Hamiltonian plays a dominant role. We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding toquadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.

## 14. Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators

**Authors:** Ralph M. Kaufmann, Mohamad Mousa, Birgit Wehefritz-Kaufmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09770v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09770v1)

**Summary:**

Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Varying systems in a family leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossingn a critical locus. We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phase can be designed and realized by a physical system. In the process, we treat several concrete models, including the lattices and tight--binding models. We also show that effective winding maps can be achieved using $k$--th nearest neighbors.
