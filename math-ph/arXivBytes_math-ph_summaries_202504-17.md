## 0. On the range of validity of parabolic models for fluid flow through   isotropic homogeneous porous media

**Authors:** Davide Dapelo, Stephan Simonis, Mohaddeseh Mousavi Nezhad, Mathias J. Krause, John Bridgeman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12280v1)

**Summary:**

Lattice-Boltzmann methods are established mesoscopic numerical schemes for fluid flow. The approximated target equations for fluid flows are typically parabolic and include a (weak) compressibility term. It is shown that the commonly-adopted assumption of negligible hydraulic dispersion is not justifiable by clear argument. By not adopting it, one can provide a quantitative expression for the effective viscosity in the Brinkman correction of Darcy law. Under certain conditions, it is possible to interpret porous models as Euler-Euler multiphase models wherein one phase is the solid matrix.

## 1. A complete theory of the Clifford commutant

**Authors:** Lennart Bittel, Jens Eisert, Lorenzo Leone, Antonio A. Mele, Salvatore F. E. Oliviero

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12263v1)

**Summary:**

Clifford group plays a central role in quantum information science. It is the building block for many error-correcting schemes. The Clifford commutant is the set of operators that commute with $k$-fold tensor powers of Clifford unitaries. This property is essential for a broad range of quantum algorithms, with applications in pseudorandomness, learning theory, benchmarking, and entanglement distillation. We show that this basis is generated by products of permutations and at most three other operators.

## 2. Logarithmic Spectral Distribution of a non-Hermitian $β$-Ensemble

**Authors:** Gernot Akemann, Francesco Mezzadri, Patricia Päßler, Henry Taylor

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12120v1)

**Summary:**

The ensemble is given by a general tridiagonal complex random matrix of normal and chi-distributed random variables. The joint distribution of eigenvalues contains a Vandermonde determinant to the power $beta$ and a residual coupling to the eigenvectors. In the low temperature limit our ensemble reduces to such a centred matrix with vanishing diagonal. It is rotationally invariant on a compact disc, given by the logarithm of the radius plus a constant. Extensive numerical simulations confirm our analytical results and put this ensemble in the context of the pseudospectrum.

## 3. QCD$_2$ 't Hooft model: 2-flavour mesons spectrum

**Authors:** Aleksandr Artemev, Alexey Litvinov, Pavel Meshcheriakov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12081v1)

**Summary:**

We continue analytical study of the meson mass spectrum in the large-$N_c$ two-dimensional QCD, known as the 't Hooft model. We develop non-perturbative methods to compute spectral sums and systematically derive large-$n$ WKB expansion of the spectrum. We examine the behavior of these results in various asymptotic regimes, including the chiral, heavy quark, and heavy-light limits, and establish a precise coincidence with known analytical and numerical results obtained through alternative approaches.

## 4. Exact noise and dissipation operators for quantum stochastic   thermodynamics

**Authors:** Stefano Giordano, Fabrizio Cleri, Ralf Blossey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11938v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11938v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of open quantum systems plays a fundamental role in several scientific and technological disciplines. Despite its widespread relevance, a rigorous formulation of quantum dissipation in conjunction with thermal noise remains a topic of active research. In this work, we establish a formal correspondence between classical stochastic thermodynamics, in particular the Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations, and the quantum master equation. The theoretical formalism is applied to two prototypical quantum systems, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in an infinite potential well.

## 5. The $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for 4-th order Schrödinger   operators on $\mathbb{R}^2$, I

**Authors:** Artbazar Galtbayar, Kenji Yajima

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11753v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11753v1)

**Summary:**

High energy parts of wave operators for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators are bounded in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for $p\in(1,\infty)$. We prove that $H=\Delta^2 + V(x)$ in $\mathbb {R} ^2$ is a wave operator. We also show that $V(x), $H$ are wave operators in the 4th order of Schr\'odinger.

## 6. Detectors for local discrimination of sets of generalized Bell states

**Authors:** Cai-Hong Wang, Jiang-Tao Yuan, Ying-Hui Yang, Mao-Sheng Li, Shao-Ming Fei, Zhi-Hao Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11747v1)

**Summary:**

A fundamental problem in quantum information processing is the discrimination among a set of orthogonal quantum states. We show how to determine all the detectors for a given GBS set. We also show that for 4-GBS sets in quantum system the detectors are almost necessary for one-way LOCC distinguishability, except for one set in the sense of local unitary equivalence. We conclude that the problem of one- way LOCC discrimination of 4- GBS sets is completely resolved.
