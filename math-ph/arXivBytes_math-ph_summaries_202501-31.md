## 0. Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical   dynamics

**Authors:** Cesare Tronci, David Martínez-Crespo, François Gay-Balmaz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587v1)

**Summary:**

The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical models. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. We apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians.

**Authors:** A. Zabrodin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18557v1)

**Summary:**

This paper is a review of the works devoted to understanding and reinterpretation of the theory of quantum integrable models solvable by Bethe ansatz. In this paper, we restrict ourselves by quantum spin chains with rational $GL(n)$-invariant $R$-matrices (of the XXX type) Also, the connection of quantum spin. chains with classical soliton equations implies a close interrelation between the spectral problem for spin chains. and integrables many-body systems of classical mechanics such as Calogero-Moser.

## 2. Balance Laws and Transport Theorems for Flows with Singular Interfaces

**Authors:** Ferdinand Thein, Gerald Warnecke

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18518v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18518v1)

**Summary:**

This paper gives a concise but rigorous mathematical description of a material control volume that is separated into two parts by a singular surface at which physical states are discontinuous. Transport theorems for use in generic balance laws are given with proofs since they provide some insight into the results. Also the step from integral balances to differential equations is given in some detail. The geometrical background material is summarized in a unified manner. The paper was published by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) in 2009.

## 3. Real-analyticity of 2-dimensional superintegrable metrics and solution   of two Bolsinov-Kozlov-Fomenko conjectures

**Authors:** Vladimir S. Matveev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18485v1)

**Summary:**

Two-dimensional Riemannian metrics are necessary real-analytic in isothermal coordinate systems. Small modification of the arguments, discussed in the paper, provides a methods to construct new superintegrable systems. This result solves Conjectures (b) and (c) explicitly formulated in Bolsinov, KOzlov and Fomenko in 1995. We prove a special case of the above conjecture which is sufficient to show that metrics constructed by K. Kiyohara in 2001, which admit irreducible polynomial in momenta integrals of arbitrary high degree $k$.

## 4. Hawking's singularity theorem for Lipschitz Lorentzian metrics

**Authors:** Matteo Calisti, Melanie Graf, Eduardo Hafemann, Michael Kunzinger, Roland Steinbauer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18450v1)

**Summary:**

We prove Hawking's singularity theorem for spacetime metrics of local Lipschitz regularity. The proof rests on (1) new estimates for the Ricci curvature of regularising smooth metrics that are based upon a quite general Friedrichs-type lemma. We replace the usual focusing techniques for timelike geodesics by a worldvolume estimate based on a segment-type inequality that allows one to control the volume of the set of points in a spacelike surface that possess long maximisers.

## 5. Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability

**Authors:** Akihiro Hokkyo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18400v1)

**Summary:**

Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. A rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for Integrability and Nonintegrable of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegRability.

## 6. Global Structure in the Presence of a Topological Defect

**Authors:** Arun Debray, Weicheng Ye, Matthew Yu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18399v1)

**Summary:**

Topological defects wrap a submanifold $F\subset M$ in a quantum field theory. The Pontryagin-Thom construction oversees the interplay between the global structure of $F$ and $M$. We will employ this construction to two distinct mathematical frameworks with physical applications. The first framework is the concept of a characteristic structure, consisting of the data of pairs of manifolds. The second framework uses obstruction theory and the fact that spontaneously broken finite symmetries leave behind domain walls.

## 7. Avoiding Big Rip Singularities in Phantom Scalar Field theory with   Gauss-Bonnet term

**Authors:** Giannis Papagiannopoulos, Genly Leon, Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18392v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar within a spatially flat FLRW geometry. We perform a detailed phase space analysis using two sets of dimensionless variables. This model supports inflationary solutions without the Big Rip or Big Crunch singularities appearing as asymptotic solutions. The result remains valid even in the absence of the interaction term. This outcome is attributed to the presence of the Gaussian scalar. The results are based on the Hubble normalization approach and the matter-scalar field normalization.

## 8. The global estimate for regular axially-symmetric solutions to the   Navier Stokes equations coupled with the heat conduction

**Authors:** Wiesław J. Grygierzec, Wojciech M. Zajączkowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18302v1)

**Summary:**

The axially-symmetric solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the heat conduction are considered. We assume that the heat flux through the boundary is imposed. Assuming existence of a sufficiently regular solution we derive a global a priori estimate in terms of data. The estimate is such that a global regular solutions can be proved. We prove the estimate because some reduction of nonlinearity are found.Moreover, deriving the global estimate for a local solution implies a possibility of its extension in time as long as the estimate holds.

## 9. The Periodic Table and the Group SO(4,4)

**Authors:** V. V. Varlamov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18272v1)

**Summary:**

The periodic system of chemical elements is represented within the framework of the weight diagram of the Lie algebra of the rotation group of an eight-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space. The hydrogen realization of the Cartan subalgebra and Weyl generators of the group algebra is studied. One of the main advantages of the proposed group-theoretic construction of the periodic system is the natural inclusion of antimatter in the general scheme. The root and weight diagrams are constructed. A mass formula associated with each node of theWeight diagram is introduced.

## 10. Existence and uniqueness of solutions to Liouville equation

**Authors:** Alireza Ataei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18234v1)

**Summary:**

We prove some general results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Liouville equation. Then, we discuss the sharpness and possible generalizations. Finally, we give several applications, arising in both mathematics and physics. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for various fields of study. We hope that this article has been of interest to readers of the Mathematical Journal of the University of California, San Diego.

## 11. Inverse source problem of sub-diffusion of variable exponent

**Authors:** Zhiyuan Li, Chunlong Sun, Xiangcheng Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18228v1)

**Summary:**

This work investigates both direct and inverse problems of the variable-exponent sub-diffusion model. Based on the perturbation method, the analytical extensibility of the solutions and the weak unique continuation principle are proved. The iterative thresholding algorithm and Nesterov iteration scheme are employed to numerically reconstruct the smooth and non-smooth sources, respectively. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate the effectiveness of these schemes. The results of the work are published in the open-source edition of Theoretical Problems.

## 12. On Euler equation for incoherent fluid in curved spaces

**Authors:** B. G. Konopelchenko, G. Ortenzi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18222v1)

**Summary:**

Hodograph equations for the Euler equation in curved spaces with constant pressure are discussed. It is shown that the use of known results concerning geodesics and associated integrals allows to construct several types of hodographs. Particular cases of cone and sphere in the 3-dimensional Eulidean space are analysed in detail. Euler equations on the sphere in 4-dimensional Euclideanspace is considered too. These hodograph. equations provide us with various classes of solutions of the E.uler equation, including stationary solutions.

## 13. On the mean-field antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled 2D Hubbard   model at zero temperature

**Authors:** Edwin Langmann, Jonatan Lenells

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18141v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18141v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results.

## 14. Self-adjoint quantization of Stäckel integrable systems

**Authors:** Jonathan M Kress, Vladimir Matveev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18082v1)

**Summary:**

We show that quadratic Hamiltonians in involution coming from a Stackel system are quantizable, in the sense that one can construct commutative self-adjoint operators. This proves a conjecture explicitly formulated in [3]. We also show that the Hamiltonians allow multiplicative separation of variables. We conclude that this proves the conjecture of [3] and [4] about the existence of the Hamiltonian in the involution of a Strackel system. We also conclude that the quadrastic Hamiltonians are quantifiable.

## 15. New vacuum boundary effects of massive field theories

**Authors:** Manuel Asorey, Fernando Ezquerro, Miguel Pardina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18072v1)

**Summary:**

The Casimir energy in 2+1 dimensions for gauge theories exponentially decays with the distance between the boundaries. The dependence of this exponential decay on the different boundary conditions could help to better understand the infrared behavior of these theories and in particular their mass spectrum. These results will be useful for a comparison with the Casimirenergy in the non-perturbative regime of non-Abelian gauge theories. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysics of Massive Scalar Fields, published by Springer.
