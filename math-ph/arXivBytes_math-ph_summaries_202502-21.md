## 0. On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing

**Authors:** Julia Boeyens, Jonas Glatthard, Edward Gandar, Stefan Nimmrichter, Luis A. Correa, Jesús Rubio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14817v1)

**Summary:**

Global sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary parameter ranges with a finite number of shots. While various formulations exist, the Bayesian paradigm offers a flexible approach to optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. We examine the practical consequences of both approaches and show how to apply them in examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy scenarios. By employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we unify the two approaches into a practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed - a blueprint for the design of quantum sensors.

## 1. Geometric analysis for the Pontryagin action and boundary terms

**Authors:** Jasel Berra-Montiel, Iñaki de Santos, Alberto Molgado

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14756v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we analyze the Pontryagin model adopting different geometric-covariant approaches. In particular, we focus on the manner in which boundary conditions must be imposed on the background manifold in order to reproduce an unambiguous theory on the boundary. At a Lagrangian level, we describe the symmetries of the theory and construct the Lagrangians. Through the multisymplectic analysis we obtain the covariant momentum map associated with the action of the gauge group on the multimomenta phase-space.

## 2. The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear   Schrödinger equation

**Authors:** Aikaterini Gkogkou, Guido Mazzuca, Kenneth D. T-R McLaughlin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$

## 3. Random walks with homotopic spatial inhomogeneities

**Authors:** Ignacio S Gomez, Daniel Rocha de Jesus, Ronaldo Thibes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14590v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we study a generalization of the standard random walk. The trajectories of the HRW exhibit convergence to a position, randomness as well as divergence, according to deformation and homotopic parameters. The HRW implies an associated Fokker-Planck equation (HFPE) provided with a bi-parameterized inhomogeneous diffusion. We use a deformed translation unitary step that arises from a homotopy of the position-dependent masses associated to the Tsallis and Kaniadakis nonexensive statistics.

## 4. Bohmian Mechanics fails to compute multi-time correlations

**Authors:** Robert C. Helling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14449v1)

**Summary:**

The violation of Bell type inequalities in quantum systems manifests that quantum states cannot be described by classical probability distributions. Yet, Bohmian mechanics is a realistic, non-local theory of classical particle trajectories that is claimed to be indistinguishable by observations from more traditional approaches to quantum mechanics. We set up a spatial version of the GHZ system with qubits realised as positional observables that demonstrates that the Bohmist theory fails to match predictions of textbook quantum mechanics (and most likely experients) unless enlarged by a microscopic theory of collapse of the wave function after observation.

## 5. Intrinsic Regularization via Curved Momentum Space: A Geometric Solution   to Divergences in Quantum Field Theory

**Authors:** Daniel Ketels

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14443v1)

**Summary:**

The problem of UV divergences in QFT has long been a fundamental challenge. We propose a novel and self-consistent approach in which UV regularization emerges naturally from the curved geometry of momentum space. This framework is self-sufficient, i.e. requires no external regulators. It retains equations of motion and is fully compatibility with standard field theory. We rigorously construct the measure-theoretic framework and demonstrate its effectiveness by proof of finiteness for key QFT integrals. This work suggests broader applications in spectral geometry, effective field theory and potential extensions to quantum gravity.

## 6. An N-to-1 Smale Horseshoe

**Authors:** Sanaz Lamei, Pouya Mehdipour

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14441v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we extend the Conley-Moser Theorem for $N$-to-1 local diffeomorphisms. By the aim of some extended symbolic dynamics we encode generalized $N $- to-1 horseshoe maps. As a corollary their structural stability is verified. The results are published in the open-source version of the book, "Horseshoe Maps: A Theory of Local Diffeomorphism" published by MIT Press on November 14, 2013.

## 7. Bootstrapping SU(3) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory

**Authors:** Yuanhong Guo, Zeyu Li, Gang Yang, Guorui Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14421v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the positivity bootstrap approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills (YM) theory. We extend previous studies of large N and SU(2) theories by incorporating multiple-trace Wilson loop operators. Our results exhibit clear convergence and are consistent with known analytic or numerical results. We propose a dimensional-reduction truncation, where Wilson loop operator are effectively restricted to a lower-dimensional subplane, significantly simplifying the computations. Our findings suggest that the positive bootstrap method is broadly applicable to higher-rank gauge theories beyond the single-trace cases.

## 8. Langevin model for soliton molecules in ultrafast fiber ring laser   cavity: investigating experimentally the interplay between noise and inertia

**Authors:** Anastasiia Sheveleva, Aurélien Coillet, Christophe Finot, Pierre Colman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14368v1)

**Summary:**

The dynamics of soliton molecules in ultrafast fiber ring laser cavity is strongly influenced by noise. We show how a parsimonious Langevin model can be constructed from experimental data, resulting in a mathematical description. Our strategy can be applied to any systems where the individual motion of its constitutive particles can be traced. The case of optical solitonic-system laser presented here serving as a proof-of-principle demonstration. It can be used as a model for other systems.

## 9. Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home When Doubled and Scaled

**Authors:** Jean-Pierre Eckmann, Tsvi Tlusty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14367v1)

**Summary:**

In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) will preferentially return to the origin. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return. We comment on the problem in higher dimensions of SO(n) and explain why this is not always the case. We conclude with a discussion of the dynamics of the rotation group in the so-called identity rotation. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.. The dynamics of physical systems can be described as a series of rotation operations.

## 10. Modelling Capillary Rise with a Slip Boundary Condition: Well-posedness   and Long-time Dynamics of Solutions to Washburn's Equation

**Authors:** Isidora Rapajić, Srboljub Simić, Endre Süli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14312v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of this paper is to extend Washburn's capillary rise equation by incorporating a slip condition at the pipe wall. The governing equation is derived using fundamental principles from continuum mechanics. A new scaling is introduced, allowing for a systematic analysis of different flow regimes. We show that the unique equilibrium solution may be reached either monotonically or in an oscillatory fashion, similarly to the no-slip case. We determine the basin of attraction for the system, ensuring that the equilibrium state will be reached from the initial data.

## 11. Fusion rules and structure constants of E-series minimal models

**Authors:** Rongvoram Nivesvivat, Sylvain Ribault

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295v1)

**Summary:**

In the ADE classification of Virasoro minimal models, the E-series is the sparsest. Their central charges are not dense in the half-line $c\in (-\infty,1)$, due to $q=12,18,30$ taking only 3 values. We deduce non-chiral fusion rules, i.e. which 3-point structure constants vanish. We conjecture that structure constants are given by a universal expression built from the double Gamma function.
