## 0. Itzykson-Zuber correlators from character expansion

**Authors:** Alexei Morozov, Hasib Sifat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05292v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate the consistency of character expansion for the Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) model in terms of Schur polynomials. The non-symmetrical structure of the correlators led us to derive an ansatz to calculate all the pair correlators. This opens a new way to study arbitrary IZ correlators of any order in character expansion. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 1. Non-local charges from perturbed defects via SymTFT in 2d CFT

**Authors:** Federico Ambrosino, Ingo Runkel, Gérard M. T. Watts

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-Local Conserved charges for perturbation by a primary bulk field with Kac label $M(p,q)$. We find solutions to the commutation conditions also for other bulk perturbings, such as $1,7.

## 2. On multipolar magnetic anomaly detection: multipolar signal subspaces,   an analytical orthonormal basis, multipolar truncature and detection   performance

**Authors:** Clément Chenevas-Paule, Steeve Zozor, Laure-Line Rouve, Olivier J. J. Michel, Olivier Pinaud, Romain Kukla

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05212v1)

**Summary:**

 magnetic anomaly detection problem aims to find hidden ferromagnetic masses by estimating the weak perturbation they induce on local Earth's magnetic field. We consider classical detection schemes that rely on signals recorded on a moving sensor. We rely on orthogonal polynomials theory to derive an analytical set of orthonormal functions that spans the space of the noise-free measured signal. We study the impact of the truncation order on the detection performance, beyond the issue of potential surparametrization.

## 3. Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry

**Authors:** Erdal Catak, Mahmut Elbistan, Mustafa Mullahasanoglu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043v1)

**Summary:**

Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for P\"oschl-Teller and Scarf profiles. We obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. We study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which shows the broader applicability of our method.

## 4. On Separation of Variables for Symmetric Spaces of Rank1

**Authors:** Alexey Bolsinov, Holger R. Dullin, Vladimir. S. Matveev, Yury Nikolayevsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04999v1)

**Summary:**

We study existence and nonexistence of diagonal and separating coordinates for Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank 1. We generalize the results of Gauduchon and Moroianu, 2020, by showing that a symmetric space has diagonal coordinates if and only if it has constant sectional curvature. We show that on the complex projective space $n=2,3$ separating coordinates necessarily have precisely $n$ ignorable coordinates. In view of results of Boyer et al, 1983 and 1985, and later results of Winternitz et al,. 1994, this completes the description of separation of variables.

## 5. Deformation of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra and the Lie superalgebra   $\mathfrak{osp}\left( {1|2} \right)$: exact solution for the quantum harmonic   oscillator with a position-dependent mass

**Authors:** E. I. Jafarov, S. M. Nagiyev, J. Van der Jeugt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04933v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04933v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a new deformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator Heisenberg-Weyl algebra with a parameter $a>-1$. This parameter is introduced through the replacement of the homogeneous mass $m_0$ with a mass varying with position $x. The obtained analytical expression of the energy spectrum consists of an infinite number of equidistant levels. The wavefunctions of the stationary states of the problem under construction are expressed through the Hermite polynomials. Some basic limit relations recovering the canonical harmonic oscillators with constant mass are also discussed briefly.

## 6. Renormalisation in the flow approach for singular SPDEs

**Authors:** Yvain Bruned, Aurélien Minguella

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04885v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study the renormalisation of singular SPDEs in the flow approach recently developed by Duch using a bottom-up setting. We introduce a general ansatz based on decorated trees for the solution of the flow equation. The ansatz is renormalised in a recursive way, in the sense of the trees, via local extractions introduced for regularity structures. We derive the renormised equation from this ansatz and show that the scheme is identical to that appearing in the context of regularity structure.

## 7. How Far do Lindbladians Go?

**Authors:** Jihong Cai, Advith Govindarajan, Marius Junge

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04883v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate geometric aspects of the space of densities by analyzing transport along paths generated by quantum Markovian semigroups. Motivated by practical constraints, we also consider a more realistic scenario in which only a restricted set of Lindbladian generators is available. We study the corresponding transitivity properties and characterize the set of states that can be reached using such limited dynamical resources.

## 8. Approach to optimal quantum transport via states over time

**Authors:** Matt Hoogsteder-Riera, John Calsamiglia, Andreas Winter

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04856v1)

**Summary:**

We approach the problem of constructing a quantum analogue of the immensely fruitful classical transport cost theory of Monge from a new angle. We explore the quantum version where the mass distribution is generalised to a density matrix, and the transport plan to a completely positive and trace preserving map. We also explore the properties of this transport cost, as well as the optimal transport cost between two given states (simply the minimum cost over all suitable transport plans). After that, we analyse in considerable detail the case of unitary invariant cost, for which we can calculate many costs analytically.

## 9. Open problems UP24

**Authors:** Maryna Manskova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04845v1)

**Summary:**

The conference Unexpected Phenomena in Energy Minimization and Polarization, held in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2024, provided a platform for researchers to discuss and propose challenging open questions across various fields. The open problems sessions were productive, fruitful and led to a range of interesting questions. In this document, we present these open problems.

## 10. Robustness of topological phases on aperiodic lattices

**Authors:** Yuezhao Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04817v1)

**Summary:**

We study the robustness of topological phases on aperiodic lattices by constructing *-homomorphisms from the groupoid model to the coarse-geometric model of observable C*-algebras. We show that the strong topological. phases in the groupoids are detected by position spectral triples. Topological phases coming from stacking along another Delone set are always weak in the coarse.geometric sense. We also show that topological physics is robust in K-theory and Kasparov theory.

## 11. Generalized Fermi-Dirac Distribution of Exclusive Fermions

**Authors:** Chung-Ru Lee, Chin-Rong Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04813v1)

**Summary:**

A system of exclusive fermions occurs when two fermion of opposite spin are prohibited from occupying the same quantum level. Salient features of its statistical properties, compared to the free electron gases, include: larger Fermi energy, higher degeneracy pressure, but the same Pauli paramagnetism and Landau diamagnetistism. Higher degeneracy Pressure leads to an inflation of the Chandrasekhar limit to 1.6 times when applied to white dwarf stars and neutron stars.
