## 0. A switching identity for cable-graph loop soups and Gaussian free fields

**Authors:** Wendelin Werner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06754v1)

**Summary:**

We derive a "switching identity" that can be stated for critical Brownian loop-soups or for the Gaussian free field on a cable graph. It says that at the level of cluster configurations and at the more general level of the occupation time fields, conditioning two points on the cable-graph to belong to the same cluster of Brownian loops amounts to adding a random odd number of independent Brownian excursions between these points. This explicit simple description of the conditional law of the clusters when a connection occurs has various direct consequences, in particular about the behaviour of these sign-clusters on infinite graphs.

## 1. The Toda-Weyl mass spectrum

**Authors:** Martin T. Luu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06732v1)

**Summary:**

The masses of affine Toda theories are known to correspond to the entries of a Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the relevant Cartan matrix. The Lagrangian of the theory can be expressed in terms of a suitable eigen vector of a Coxeter element in the Weyl group. We generalize this set-up by formulating Lagrangians based on eigenvectors of arbitrary elements. Under some technical conditions (that hold for many Weyl Group elements), we calculate the classical mass spectrum.

## 2. Exact NESS of XXZ circuits boundary driven with arbitrary resets or   fields

**Authors:** Vladislav Popkov, Tomaž Prosen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06731v1)

**Summary:**

We propose spatially inhomogeneous matrix product ansatz for an exact many-body density operator of a boundary driven XXZ quantum circuit. The circuit is driven by a pair of reset quantum channels applied on the boundary qubits, which polarize the qubits to arbitrary pure target states. Analyzing the ansatz we obtain a family of relatively robust separable nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), which can be viewed as a circuit extension of spin-helix states. These steady states are particularly suited for experimental investigations.

## 3. Survival probabilities in biased random walks: To restart or not to   restart? that is the question

**Authors:** Shahar Hod

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06667v1)

**Summary:**

Time-dependent survival probability function $S(t;x_0,q)$ of biased Sisyphus random walkers. At each time step, walkers have a finite probability $q$ to step towards an absorbing trap at the origin. We explicitly prove that the survival probability of the walkers decays exponentially at asymptotically late times. For a given value of the biased jumping probability, survival probability is characterized by a critical (marginal) value of initial gap between walkers and trap.

## 4. Twists of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory in Topological String Theory

**Authors:** Philsang Yoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06647v1)

**Summary:**

We show that every twist of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group GL(N) can be realized as an open-string field theory in topological string theory. Our approach reinterprets twists of supersymphony Yang-mills theory as generalized Chern-Simons theories. We identify topologicalstring backgrounds that produce the corresponding Chern- Simons theories, and show how they can be combined to form a new type of string field theory.

## 5. Semi-classical limit of the massive Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system toward   the relativistic Euler-Maxwell system via an adapted modulated energy method

**Authors:** Tony Salvi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06622v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the momentum, the density, and the electromagnetic field associated with the massive KleinGordon-Maxwell equations converge in the semi-classical limit. The proof relies on a modulated stress-energy method and a compactness argument. We also give a proof of the well-posedness of the relativistic Euler- Maxwell equations and show how this system is related to the relatvistic massive Vlasov-Max well equations. We conclude that the system can be used to understand the universe.

## 6. Convex Split Lemma without Inequalities

**Authors:** Gilad Gour

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06526v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a refinement to the convex split lemma by replacing the max mutual information with the collision mutual information. This refinement yields tighter achievability bounds for quantum source coding tasks, including state merging and state splitting. Furthermore, we derive a universal upper bound on the smoothed max mutual info. This result has significant implications for quantum information processing, particularly in applications such as the reverse quantum Shannon theorem. We conclude that the bound depends exclusively on R\'enyi entropies and is independent of the system's dimensions.

## 7. Spectral and dynamical results related to certain non-integer base   expansions on the unit interval

**Authors:** Horia D. Cornean, Ira W. Herbst, Giovanna Marcelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06511v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06511v1)

**Summary:**

We consider certain non-integer base $\beta$-expansions of Parry's type. We show that if $f$ is Lipschitz, then the iterated sequence converges exponentially fast (in the $L^1$ norm) to an invariant state. This "attracting" eigenvalue is not isolated: we show that the point spectrum of $1$ also contains the whole open complex unit disk. We explicitly construct some corresponding eigenfunctions.

## 8. Polynomially Superintegrable Hamiltonians Separating in Cartesian   Coordinates

**Authors:** Ian Marquette, Anthony Parr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06384v1)

**Summary:**

The problem of finding superintegrable Hamiltonians and their integrals of motion can be reduced to solving a series of compatibility equations that result from the overdetermination of the commutator or Poisson bracket relations. The computation of the compatibility equations requires a general formula for the coefficients, which in turn must depend on the potential to be solved for. This is in general a nonlinear problem and quite difficult. Research has focused on dividing the classes of potential into standard and exotic ones so that a number of parameters may be set to zero and the coefficients may be obtained in a simpler setting. We have developed a new method in both the classical and quantum setting.

## 9. Exact collective occupancies of the Moshinsky model in two-dimensional   geometry

**Authors:** Arkadiusz Kuroś, Adam Pieprzycki, Edyta Gawin, Przemysław Kościk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06310v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the ground state of $N$ bosonic atoms confined in a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic trap, where the atoms interact via a harmonic potential. We derive an exact diagonal representation of the first-order reduced density matrix in polar coordinates, in which the angular components of the natural orbitals are eigenstates of the angular momentum operator. We present an exact expression for the collective occupancy of thenatural orbitals with angular momentum $l$, quantifying the fraction of particles carrying that angular momentum.

## 10. Dynamical Spreading Under Power Law Potential

**Authors:** Ido Fanto, Yuval Rosenblum, Ori Harel, Naomi Oppenheimer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06256v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the dynamic spreading of a dense suspension of particles under power law repulsive potentials decaying as $1/r^k$. We find analytically that the particles spread in a self-similar form, where the radius grows with time. When two or more such suspensions are placed near each other, the system retains a power-law memory of its initial state, resulting in a particle-free zone at the interface of the merging populations. We further substantiate the theory by molecular dynamic simulations of thousands of particles in one and two dimensions.

## 11. DGNO: A Novel Physics-aware Neural Operator for Solving Forward and   Inverse PDE Problems based on Deep, Generative Probabilistic Modeling

**Authors:** Yaohua Zang, Phaedon-Stelios Koutsourelakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06250v1)

**Summary:**

Existing neural operator methods struggle with high-dimensional, discontinuous inputs and require large amounts of labeled training data. We propose the Deep Generative Neural Operator (DGNO), a physics-aware framework that addresses these challenges. We also introduce MultiONet, a novel neural operator architecture, which is a more expressive generalization of the popular DeepONet. These innovations make DGNO particularly effective for challenging forward and inverse, PDE-based problems, such as those involving multi-phase media.

## 12. Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups   and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups

**Authors:** Claudia Pinzari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229v1)

**Summary:**

We solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects of the problem. We conclude with the conclusion that SU(d) is a special case of their unique compact gauge group in algebraic QFT.

## 13. Exact solvability of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for bound states   subjected to general potentials

**Authors:** M. Mirón, E. Sadurní

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06120v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we present the analytic solution to the problem of bound states of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation in 1D. We show that the GP equation can be mapped to a first-order non-autonomous dynamical system. The formal solutions of this non-conservative system can be written with the help of Glauber-Trotter formulas or a series of ordered exponentials in the coordinate $x$. With this we illustrate how to solve any nonlinear problem based on a construction due to Mello and Kumar for the linear case.

## 14. Monotone operator methods for a class of nonlocal multi-phase variable   exponent problems

**Authors:** Mustafa Avci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06081v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study a class of nonlocal multi-phase variable exponent problems within the framework of a newly introduced Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev space. We consider two problems, each distinguished by the type of nonlinearity it includes. To establish the existence of at least one nontrivial solution for each problem, we employ two different monotone operator methods. We conclude that we have found a solution to each of the two problems using two different methods.
