## 0. Mutual Multilinearity of Nonequilibrium Network Currents

**Authors:** Sara Dal Cengio, Pedro E. Harunari, Vivien Lecomte, Matteo Polettini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04298v1)

**Summary:**

C currents are fundamental entities that describe the flows of energy, particles, individuals, chemical species, information, or other quantities. They apply to systems described by agents transitioning between vertices along the edges of a network (at some rate in each direction) It has recently been shown that, at stationarity, a hidden linearity exists between currents that flow along edges. In this paper, we extend this result to the situation where one controls the currents of several edges, and prove that other currents are in linear-affine relation with the input ones.

## 1. Algebras behind the bispectrality of the Wilson rational functions and   their ${}_4φ_3$ limits

**Authors:** Nicolas Crampe, Satoshi Tsujimoto, Luc Vinet, Alexei Zhedanov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04275v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04275v1)

**Summary:**

The properties of the Wilson rational functions with three different normalizations are described. The so-called Wilson rational algebra is introduced, which encodes algebraically the spectral properties of these special functions. For one of these, the spectral algebra simplifies to yield the meta $q$-Racah algebra. Finally, different limits are considered, leading up to functions proportional to $q/2$ and $Q/3$ The results are published in the book "Wilson rational algebra: The Theory and Practice"

## 2. Probability Bracket Notation for Probability Modeling

**Authors:** Xing M. Wang, Tony C. Scott

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04257v1)

**Summary:**

The Bracket Notation (PBN) is based on the Dirac Notation in Quantum Mechanics. Using the PBN, many formulae, such as normalizations and expectations in systems of one or more random variables, can now be written in abstract basis-independent expressions. The time evolution of homogeneous Markov processes can also be formatted in such a way. Potential applications show the usefulness of PBN beyond the constrained domain and range of Hermitian operators on Hilbert Spaces in QM all the way to IT.

## 3. Black Hole Evaporation in Loop Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** Abhay Ashtekar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252v1)

**Summary:**

The conference marked the 50th anniversary of Hawking's seminal paper on black hole radiance. It was clear already from Hawking's analysis that a proper quantum gravity theory would be essential for a more complete understanding of the evaporation process. This task was undertaken in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) two decades ago and by now the literature on the subject is quite rich. The goal of this contribution is to summarize a mainstream perspective that has emerged. The intended audience is the broader gravitational physics community, rather than quantum gravity experts.

## 4. General theory of slow non-Hermitian evolution

**Authors:** Parveen Kumar, Yuval Gefen, Kyrylo Snizhko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04214v1)

**Summary:**

Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitsian systems. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations, say the authors. The approach may be useful for designing devices based on non- hermitian physics.

## 5. Leading and beyond leading-order spectral form factor in chaotic quantum   many-body systems across all Dyson symmetry classes

**Authors:** Vijay Kumar, Tomaž Prosen, Dibyendu Roy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04152v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04152v1)

**Summary:**

We show the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) spectral correlations in the chaotic phase of generic periodically kicked interacting quantum many-body systems. spectral form factor (SFF), $K(t)$, up to two leading orders in time, $t$. We explicitly consider the presence or absence of time reversal to investigate all three Dyson's symmetry classes. Our calculation of SFF is plausible in higher space dimensions as well, where similar system-size scalings of $t^*$ can be obtained.

## 6. Octagonal tilings with three prototiles

**Authors:** April Lynne D. Say-awen, Sam Coates

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04133v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a family of octagonal tilings which are composed of three prototiles. We define our tilings with respect to two non-negative integers, $m$ and $n$, so that the inflation factor of a given tiling is $m+n (1+\sqrt{2})$. We show that our family consists of an infinite series of tilings, which can be delineated into separate `cases' which are determined by the relationship between $m and $ n.

## 7. Discontinuous transition in 2D Potts: I. Order-Disorder Interface   convergence

**Authors:** Moritz Dober, Alexander Glazman, Sébastien Ott

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04129v1)

**Summary:**

The planar q-state Potts model undergoes a discontinuous phase transition when q > 4 and there are exactly q + 1 extremal Gibbs measures at the transition point. We show emergence of a free layer of width between the two ordered phases (wetting) and establish convergence of its boundaries to two Brownian bridges conditioned not to intersect. In a companion work, we provide a detailed study of the Pottsmodel under order-order Dobrushin conditions. The coupling relates the interface in FK-percolation to a long subcritical cluster in the ATRC model.

## 8. A new perspective on the equivalence between Weak and Strong Spatial   Mixing in two dimensions

**Authors:** Sébastien Ott

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04117v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04117v1)

**Summary:**

 weak mixing in lattice models is informally the property that information does not propagate inside a system. In dimension two, the boundary of reasonable systems is one dimensional, so information should not be able to propagate there. This led to the conjecture that in 2D, weak mixing implies strong mixing. The present work gives a new proof of these results, extends the family of models for which the implication holds, and, most interestingly, provides a ``percolative picture'' of the information propagation.

## 9. On multipoint correlation functions in the Sinh-Gordon 1+1 dimensional   quantum field theory

**Authors:** Karol K. Kozlowski, Alex Simon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03894v1)

**Summary:**

This work provides a closed, explicit and rigorous expression for the appropriately truncated $k$-point function of the integrable 1+1 dimensional Sinh-Gordon quantum field theory. The results are obtained within the bootstrap program setting. The work is published in the open-source version of the book, "Quantum Field Theory: The Theory and Its Applications," published by the University of California, San Diego, in 2009. The book is available for download from the Internet.

## 10. Arcsine laws for Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting

**Authors:** Kacper Taźbierski, Marcin Magdziarz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03889v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03889v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the equivalents of the celebrated arcsine laws for Brownian motion undergoing Poissonian resetting. We obtain closed-form formulae for the probability density functions of the corresponding random variables in the cases of the first and second arcsine law. Furthermore, we obtain numerical results for the third law. We conclude that the laws are equivalent to the first, second, and third arcsine Laws of Brownian Motion. The results of the study are published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics.

## 11. Adaptive Cross Approximation with a Geometrical Pivot Choice: ACA-GP   Method

**Authors:** Vladislav A. Yastrebov, Camille Noûs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03886v1)

**Summary:**

Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) method is widely used to approximate admissible blocks of hierarchical matrices. ACA constructs a low-rank approximation by evaluating only a few rows and columns of the original operator. This paper proposes combining the classical, purely algebraic ACA method with a geometrical pivot selection based on the central subsets and extreme property subsets. The method is named ACA-GP, GP stands for Geometrical Pivots. The superiority of the ACA- GP compared to the classical ACA is demonstrated using a classical Green operator for two clouds of interacting points.

## 12. Weyl symmetry of the gradient-flow in information geometry

**Authors:** Tatsuaki Wada, Sousuke Noda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03866v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03866v1)

**Summary:**

The gradient-flow equations are derived from the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl's gauge transformations. In Weyl integrable geometry, we have related Amari's $alpha$-connections in IG to Weyl invariant connection on the Riemannian manifold equipped with the scaled metric. We have revisited the gradient- flow in information geometry from the perspective of Weyl symmetry. The equations are based on the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl gauge transitions.

## 13. On the spectral theory of sign-changing Laplace operators

**Authors:** Yves Colin de Verdière

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03838v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03838v1)

**Summary:**

We study spectral theory of sign-changing Laplace operators using semi-classical Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps. We prove the existence of modesconcentrated on the interface and describe an effective semi- classical equation for them. We also show that modes can be focused on a single point on the surface of the Laplace operator. The results are published in the open-access issue of the Journal of Applied Mathematics, published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 14. Multisymplectic structure of nonintegrable Henon-Heiles system

**Authors:** A. V. Tsiganov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03786v1)

**Summary:**

Multi-symplectic integrators are typically regarded as a discretization of the Hamiltonian partial differential equations. This is due to the fact that, for generic finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, there exists only one independent symplectic structure. In this note, the second invariant symplectic form is presented for the nonintegrable Henon-Heiles system, Kepler problem, integrable and non-integrably Toda type systems. This approach facilitates the construction of a multi-syMPlectic integrator, which effectively preserves both symplectic forms for these benchmark problems.

## 15. Quantum integrable model for the quantum cohomology/quantum K-theory of   flag varieties and the double $β$-Grothendieck polynomials

**Authors:** Jirui Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03768v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03768v1)

**Summary:**

A GL$(n)$ quantum integrable system generalizing the asymmetric five vertices spin chain is shown to encode the ring relations of the equivariant quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory ring of flag varieties. We also show that the Bethe ansatz states of this system generate the double $\beta$-Grothendieck polynomials. We conclude that the system can be used to prove the theory of quantum entanglement in terms of a quantum ring.

## 16. The Global Existence and Uniqueness of Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs   Equation in (2+1) Dimensions

**Authors:** Mulyanto, Ardian N. Atmaja, Fiki T. Akbar, Bobby E. Gunara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03733v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03733v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we show the global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions of the Maxwell-Chern-Simmons-Higgs system. Our methods rely only on classical existence theorems, including energy estimates, the Sobolev inequality, and the choice of the Coulomb gauge condition. The equations are well-posed for finite initial data and the solution preserves any additional $H^{s}$ regularity for $s>0$ in the data. The solution is coupled to a neutral scalar with nontrivial scalar potential on (2+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
