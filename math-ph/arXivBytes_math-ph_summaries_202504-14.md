## 0. Deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's Instantons on Bryant-Salamon   $Spin(7)$-Manifold

**Authors:** Tathagata Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08723v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08723v1)

**Summary:**

The Bryant-Salamon $Spin(7)$-Manifold -- the negative spinor bundle of $S^4$ -- is an asymptotically conical manifold where the link is the squashed $7$-sphere. We use the deformation theory developed by the author in a previous paper to calculate the deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's instantons. We also calculate the virtual dimensions of the moduli spaces. The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics.

## 1. Computational Stochastic Mechanics of a Simple Bound State

**Authors:** Nathaniel A. Lynd

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08669v1)

**Summary:**

Stochastic mechanics is based on the hypothesis that all matter is subject to universal modified Brownian motion. We calculate a velocity field directly from the potential and total energy and then use the resultant velocity field to do a stochastic Langevin integration over histories to create the probability density distribution for particle position. The results suggest a pathway for future development of Stochastic mechanics as a numerical strategy to describe the structure of physical quantum systems for applications in chemistry, materials and information sciences. We explore the effect of energy defect off of the ground state energy on the velocity field.

## 2. Symmetry Resolved Entanglement with $U(1)$ Symmetry: Some Closed   Formulae for Excited States

**Authors:** Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo, Lucía Santamaría-Sanz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08668v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we revisit a problem we addressed in previous publications with various collaborators, that is, the computation of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropies of zero-density excited states in infinite volume. The universal nature of the charged moments of these states has already been noted previously. Here, we investigate this problem further, by writing general formulae for the entropie of excited states consisting of an arbitrary number of subsets of identical excitations. When the initial state is written in terms of qubits with appropriate probabilistic coefficients, we find the final formulAE to be of a combinatorial nature too.

## 3. Holley--Stroock uniqueness method for the $\varphi^4_2$ dynamics

**Authors:** Roland Bauerschmidt, Benoit Dagallier, Hendrik Weber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08606v1)

**Summary:**

The approach establishes the uniqueness of invariant measures of Glauber dynamics of lattice spin systems. The approach requires three ingredients: a uniform log-Sobolev inequality, a propagation speed estimate, and a crude estimate on the relative entropy of the law of the finite volume dynamics at time $1$ The last two ingredients are understood very generally on the lattice, but the proofs do not extend to SPDEs. We use this approach to prove uniqueness of the invariant measure of the SPDE up to the critical temperature (characterised by finite susceptibility)

## 4. Delta functions on twistor space and their sign factors

**Authors:** Jun-ichi Note

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08523v1)

**Summary:**

Previous studies conjectured that sign factors are intrinsic in the real twistor space corresponding to the split signature space-time. In this study, we present a new geometrical interpretation of the sign factors. We also propose a new definition of delta functions on the complex twistorspace in terms of the Cech cohomology group without any sign factors and show that these delta functions have conformal inviolable functionality. We show that the inverse Fourier transforms of these delta function are the scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory.

## 5. Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight

**Authors:** Peter A. Clarkson, Kerstin Jordaan, Ana Loureiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08522v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08522v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the properties of the coefficients in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for theRecurrence coefficients are provided.

## 6. Quasi-stationarity of the Dyson Brownian Motion With Collisions

**Authors:** Arnaud Guillin, Boris Nectoux, Liming Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08467v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate the ergodic behavior of a system of particules, subject to collisions, before it exits a fixed subdomain of its state space. This system is composed of several one-dimensional ordered Brownian particules in interaction with electrostatic repulsions, which is usually referred as the (generalized) Dyson Brownian motion. The starting points of our analysis are the work [E. C{\'e}pa and D. L. Lpingle, 1997 Probab. Theory Relat. Fields] which provides existence and uniqueness of such a system.

## 7. On the Cauchy problem for the reaction-diffusion system with   point-interaction in $\mathbb R^2$

**Authors:** Daniele Barbera, Vladimir Georgiev, Mario Rastrelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08460v1)

**Summary:**

The paper studies the existence of solutions for the reaction-diffusion equation in $\mathbb R^2$ with point-interaction laplacian. By semigroup estimates, we get the existence and uniqueness of solutions on. Finally, we prove decay in time of the functions. The paper was published in the online edition of the journal Cauchy-Rosenbaum, published by the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2007. It was the first paper of its kind to be published on the topic.

## 8. Sums of infinite series involving the Dirichlet lambda function

**Authors:** Su Hu, Min-Soo Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08347v1)

**Summary:**

Dirichlet's lambda function was firstly studied by Euler in the real axis under the notation $N(s)$. In this paper, we establish closed-form expressions for several classes of infinite series involving the function. As a by product, we show that the Lambda-values appear as the constant terms of the Eisenstein series for the congruence subgroup $Gamma_{0}(2).$ We conclude that the lambda-values $Lambda(2k)$ are constant terms in the series.

## 9. On the SUSY structure of spherically symmetric Pauli Hamiltonians

**Authors:** Georg Junker

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08311v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum Hamiltonian characterising a non-relativistic electron under the influence of an external spherical symmetric electromagnetic potential exhibits a supersymmetric structure. The current approach, which includes the spin-1/2 degree of freedom, provides new insights to known models like the radial harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb problem. We also find a few new exactly solvable models, one of them exhibiting a new mixed type of shape invariance containing translation and scaling of potential parameters. The fundamental role as Witten parity played by thespin-orbit operator is high-lighted.

## 10. Skew Plücker relations

**Authors:** Kazuya Aokage, Eriko Shinkawa, Hiro-fumi Yamada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08293v1)

**Summary:**

Schur functions satisfy the relative Pl\"ucker relations which describe the projective embedding of the flag varieties and the Hirota bilinear equations for the modified KP hierarchies. These relative Pl\'ucker relations are generalized to the skew Schur functions. The Schur function is the skew version of the Lie algebras used in the theory of the KP hierarchy. It is the same function that is used for the Lie algebra of KP hierarchy and the Lie group of KP varieties.

## 11. Minimal algebraic solutions of the sixth equation of Painlevé

**Authors:** Robert Conte

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08287v1)

**Summary:**

For each of the forty-eight exceptional algebraic solutions $u(x)$ of the sixth equation of Painlev\'e, we build the algebraic curve $P(u,x)=0$ of a degree conjectured to be minimal. This degree is equal to the number of branches, except for fifteen solutions. We give an optimal parametric representation of it. For example, we say that the curve is the product of the curve and the degree of the solution to the equation.

## 12. Rational Extension of Quantum Anisotropic Oscillator Potentials with   Linear and/or Quadratic Perturbations

**Authors:** Rajesh Kumar Yadav, Rajesh Kumar, Avinash Khare

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08236v1)

**Summary:**

We present a comprehensive study of the rational extension of the quantum anisotropic harmonic oscillator (QAHO) potentials with linear and/or quadratic perturbations. For the one-dimensional harmonic. oscillator plus imaginary linear perturbation ($i\lambda x$), we show that the rational. extension is possible not only for the even but also for the odd co-dimensions $m$. In two-dimensional case, we construct the rational extensions for QAHO potentials. with quadratics ($\lambda \, xy$) perturbated both when $\lambda$ is real or imaginary and obtain their solutions. Finally, we extend the discussion to the three-dimensional Q AHO
