## 0. On Walker and para-Hermite Einstein spaces

**Authors:** Adam Chudecki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15221v1)

**Summary:**

A special class of (complex) para-Hermite Einstein spaces is analyzed. For this class of spaces the self-dual Weyl tensor is type-[D] in the Petrov-Penrose classification. The spaces are not only para- Hermite but also Walker. A classification of the spaces according to three criteria is given. Finally, explicit metrics of all admitted Petrov/Penrose types are found. It is assumed that this congruence is parallely propagated.

## 1. Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators

**Authors:** Daichi Nakamura, Kohei Kawabata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15154v1)

**Summary:**

Non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps. Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. We uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four- dimensional systems with no symmetry ( class A) We further demonstrate that these non-Hermitsian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.

## 2. On negative eigenvalues of 1D Schrödinger operators with   $δ'$-like potentials

**Authors:** Yuriy Golovaty, Rostyslav Hryniv

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14934v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14934v1)

**Summary:**

We study the asymptotic behavior of the discrete spectrum of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators. These operators are used to construct exactly solvable models for localized dipoles in quantum mechanics. Although these operators converge in the norm resolvent topology to a limiting operator that is bounded from below, we prove that they can possess a finite but arbitrarily large number of discrete eigenvalues that diverge to negative infinity as the regularization parameter tends to zero. This phenomenon illustrates a spectral instability of Schr\'odinger operators with these singular potentials.

## 3. Quantum Curves in the Context of Symplectic Duality

**Authors:** Alexander Hock, Sergey Shadrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14924v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss how to use the recent progress in understanding of the $x$-$y$ duality and symplectic duality in the theory of topological recursion. The paper also contains an overview of recent generalizations of the setup of topology recursion prompted by the progress in understand the $X$-$Y$ dualy. We use these generalizations in order to efficiently compute the quantum spectral curve operators for the wave functions with arbitrary base points. We conclude with a discussion of some of the recent developments in the field of quantum spectral curves.

## 4. Dynamics of pulsating swarmalators on a ring

**Authors:** Samali Ghosh, Kevin O'Keeffe, Gourab Kumar Sar, Dibakar Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14912v1)

**Summary:**

We study a simple one-dimensional model of swarmalators, a generalization of phase oscillators that swarm around in space as well as synchronize internal oscillations in time. Previous studies of the model focused on Kuramoto-type couplings, where the phase interactions are governed by phase differences. Here we consider Winfree-type coupling, where interactions are multiplicative, determined by the product of a phase response function and a phase pulse function. Six long-term modes of organization are found, which we characterize numerically and analytically.

## 5. On tensor invariants of the Clebsch system

**Authors:** A. V. Tsiganov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14867v1)

**Summary:**

We present some new Poisson bivectors that are invariants by the Clebsch system flow. Symplectic integrators on their symplectic leaves exactly preserve the corresponding Casimir functions, which have different physical meanings. The Kahan discretization of the CleBSch system is discussed briefly. We also show some new Kahan bivector that are invariants by the Cletsch system. We conclude with a discussion of the Kahan discretization of the Clebsch system.

## 6. Categorifying Clifford QCA

**Authors:** Bowen Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14811v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14811v1)

**Summary:**

We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) We reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results. We relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions.

## 7. Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched   Hilbert Subspace Interpretation

**Authors:** Xing M. Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791v1)

**Summary:**

Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) describes measurement as branching the local Hilbert space of a system into parallel subspaces. We formalize the mathematical framework of BHSI using branching and the engaging and disengaging unitary operators to relationally and causally update the states of observers. Compared to the Copenhagen Interpretation and Many-Worlds Interpretation, BHSi provides a minimalist, unitarity-preserving, collapse-free, and probabilistically inherent alternative interpretation of quantum measurements.
