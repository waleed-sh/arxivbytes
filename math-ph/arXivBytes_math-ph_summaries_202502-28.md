## 0. Mechanics on flag manifolds

**Authors:** Andrew Kuzovchikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20397v1)

**Summary:**

We study the connection between spin chains and one-dimensional sigma models on flag manifolds. Using this connection, we calculate the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and geodesics for a particular class of metrics on a manifold of complete flags in $\mathbb{C}^3$. We conclude that this connection leads to a more general theory of spin chains on flag manifold magnets. We also show that this theory can be generalized to a manifold with more complete flags.

## 1. Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with   Unruh-DeWitt detectors

**Authors:** Albert Georg Passegger, Rainer Verch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects.

## 2. Non-relativistic limit of Dirac Hamiltonians with Aharonov-Bohm fields

**Authors:** Matteo Gallone, Alessandro Michelangeli, Diego Noja

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20318v1)

**Summary:**

We exploit the non-relativistic limit of infinite light speed to connect the former to the latter. The limit consists of the customary removal of the rest energy and of a suitable scaling, with the light speed, of the short-scale boundary condition of self-adjointness. This ensures that the scattering length of the Aharonov-Bohm interaction is preserved along the limit. Noteworthy is the fact that the whole family of Dirac-AB operators is mapped into the physically relevant sub-family of $s$-wave, angular-momentum-commuting, Schr\"{o}\-dinger-AB Hamiltonians.

## 3. Boltzmann framework for polyatomic gases: review on well-posedness,   higher integrability and physical relevance

**Authors:** Ricardo Alonso, Milana Colic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20308v1)

**Summary:**

This paper reviews results on the scalar Boltzmann equation for a single- component polyatomic gas with continuous internal energy. For the space homogeneous problem, $L^1$-theory is established, for solutions with initial strictly positive mass and bounded energy. All these analytical results hold under a specific assumption on the collision kernel corresponding to cut-off and hard-potentials type. Comparison with experimental data for polytropic gases determines values of these parameters showing the physical relevance of the collision kernels.

## 4. Symmetry defects and gauging for quantum states with matrix product   unitary symmetries

**Authors:** Adrián Franco-Rubio, Arkadiusz Bochniak, J. Ignacio Cirac

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20257v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we examine the consequences of the existence of a finite group of matrix product unitary (MPU) symmetries for matrix product states (MPS) We generalize the well-understood picture of onsite unitary symmetry, which give rise to virtual symmetry defects given by insertions of operators in the bonds of the MPS. We introduce a condition, block independence, under which we can gauge the symmetry defects to gauge degrees of freedom, yielding an MPS of the same bond dimension.

## 5. Homotopy Manin Theories: Generalising Third-Way, Yang-Mills and   Integrable Sigma Models

**Authors:** Alex S. Arvanitakis, Leron Borsten, Dimitri Kanakaris, Hyungrok Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20251v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20251v1)

**Summary:**

Manin theories are non-topological deformations of Chern-Simons theories. They admit localisation despite not being supersymmetric in the usual sense. In this paper, we extend this construction to higher dimensions. This produces a large class of examples of third-way-type theories. The construction naturally yields Yang-Baxter integrable deformations. It also yields gravitational models various dimensions. The results are published in the Journal of Theoretical and Applied Physics (JTPAP)

It highlights their potential to revolutionize piezoeslectric devices and promote sustainable development and conservation. The study emphasizes numerical models that demonstrate enhanced piezoclectric behaviour and their use in eco- friendly technologies.

## 7. Solving Linear Differential Equations by recursion and integrating   factors

**Authors:** Everardo Rivera-Oliva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20219v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, a recursive solution technique in conjunction with generalized integrating factors is presented and applied to address first and second order linear differential equations. This approach demonstrates practical utility in classical differential equations encountered in physics, inclusive of equations with variable coefficients. The approach is useful when a pattern within the recursion is identifiable, thus enabling the derivation of an explicit expression for $y(x)$. The study was published in the online edition of the Journal of Applied Mathematics, published by Oxford University Press.

## 8. Decay of resolvent kernels and Schrödinger eigenstates for Lévy   operators

**Authors:** Kamil Kaleta, René L. Schilling, Paweł Sztonyk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20210v1)

**Summary:**

We study the spatial decay behaviour of resolvent kernels for a large class of non-local L\'evy operators and bound states of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators. Our findings naturally lead us to proving results for L \'evy measures, which have subexponential or exponential decay, respectively. This leads to sharp transitions in the the decay rates of the resolent kernels. We obtain estimates that allow us to describe and understand the intricate decay behaviour. We extend findings by Carmona, Masters and Simon for fractional Laplacians (the subexp exponential regime) and classical relativistic operators (the exponential regime).

## 9. Highly Entangled 2D Ground State: Tensor Network, Order Parameter and   Correlation

**Authors:** Olai B. Mykland, Zhao Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20192v1)

**Summary:**

The tensor network constructed is one dimension higher than the lattice of the physical system. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes in 3D space. The network directly generalizes the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the order parameter of in the spin sector from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, and the correlation in the color sector.

## 10. Limit theorems for the non-convex multispecies Curie-Weiss model

**Authors:** Francesco Camilli, Emanuele Mingione, Godwin Osabutey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20155v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermodynamic properties of the generalized non-convex multispecies Curie-Weiss model. It is shown that a central limit theorem holds for a rescaled and centered vector of species magnetizations, which converges to either a centered or non-centered multivariate normal distribution, depending on the rate of convergence of the relative sizes of the species. For spins with a generic prior distribution, we compute the pressure in the thermodynamics limit using simple interpolation techniques. For Ising spins, we further analyze the fluctuations of the magnetization in the temperature limit under the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure.

## 11. Integral representation of solutions to initial-boundary value problems   in the framework of the hyperbolic heat equation

**Authors:** Sergey A. Rukolaine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20057v1)

**Summary:**

We consider initial-boundary value problems on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and modified Fourier's law. This hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations is the simplest model of non-Fourier heat conduction. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method. The heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other.

## 12. Hyperelliptic sigma functions and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation

**Authors:** Takanori Ayano, Victor M. Buchstaber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19972v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19972v1)

**Summary:**

Hyperelliptic solutions to Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations KP-I and KP-II are obtained. The long-standing problem of describing the dependence of these solutions on the variation of the parameters is solved. A theory of hyperelliptics based on multidimensional sigma functions is developed and explicit formulas for hyperellipic solutions are given. The theory is based on a set of multidimensional sigma functions and a series of Hugelliptic curves.

## 13. First order operators on shrinking graph-like spaces

**Authors:** Pavel Exner, Olaf Post

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19904v1)

**Summary:**

In this article we discuss the convergence of first order operators on a thickened graph (a graph-like space) towards a similar operator on the underlying metric graph. The square of the first order operator is of Laplace type; on the metric graph, the function (0-form) component is the usual standard (Kirchhoff) Laplacian. A key ingredient in the proof is a uniform Gaffney estimate: such an estimate follows from an equality relating here the divergence operator with all (weak) partial derivatives and a curvature term.

## 14. Postponing the choice: advantage of deferred measurements in quantum   information processing

**Authors:** C. Carmeli, T. Heinosaari, A. Toigo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19871v1)

**Summary:**

Simultaneously implementing two arbitrary quantum measurements on the same system is impossible. Two incompatible choices can then be forced together only at the cost of adding enough noise to the measurements. An intriguing alternative is to postpone the choice, or part of it, until a later stage. In certain scenarios postponing the choice introduces no additional cost, while in others partial postponement can be effectively the same as full postponement. We explore the advantages of this deferred decision-making and discover that the benefits critically depends on the assumptions about the forthcoming choice.

## 15. Axisymmetric type II blowup solutions to the three dimensional   Keller-Segel system

**Authors:** Thomas Y. Hou, Van Tien Nguyen, Peicong Song

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19775v1)

**Summary:**

We construct axisymmetric solutions to the three-dimensional parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system that blows up in finite time. In particular, the singularity is of type II, which admits locally a leading order profile of the rescaled stationary solution. We rely on an approximate solution of the eigenproblem associated with the linearized operator around the stationary solution as well as the modulation dynamics to control the perturbation function and derive the accurate blowup rate.

## 16. Infinite-dimensional Extension of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian   Simulation: Theorems and Applications

**Authors:** Rundi Lu, Hao-En Li, Zhengwei Liu, Jin-Peng Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19688v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation (LCHS) formula to simulate time-evolution operators in infinite-dimensional spaces. This extension bridges the gap between finite-dimensional quantum simulations and the broader class of quantum dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) We demonstrate the applicability of the Inf-L CHS theorem to a wide range of non-Hermitian dynamics, including linear parabolic PDEs, queueing models (birth-or-death processes) and Schr\"odinger equations with complex potentials.
