## 0. Connection formulae for the radial Toda equations II

**Authors:** Martin A. Guest, Alexander R. Its, Maksim Kosmakov, Kenta Miyahara, Ryosuke Odoi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17783v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17783v1)

**Summary:**

This is a continuation of [arXiv:2309.16550] in which we computed the asymptotics near $x = \infty$ of all solutions of the radial Toda equation. The equations are related in the sense that their respective monodromy data constitute connected components of the same "monodromy manifold" While all solutions are smooth, those of the partner equation have infinitely many singularities, and this makes the Riemann-Hilbert nonlinear steepest descent method more involved.

## 1. Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory

**Authors:** David Andriot, Muthusamy Rajaguru, George Tringas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775v1)

**Summary:**

In most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V>0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V<0$.

## 2. Enhanced dissipation by advection and applications to PDEs

**Authors:** Anna L. Mazzucato, Yuanyuan Feng, Camilla Nobili

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17695v1)

**Summary:**

This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview on enhanced dissipation phenomena. The discussion begins with the standard theory of enhanced Dissipation, highlighting key mechanisms and results. It progresses to its applications in notable nonlinear PDEs such as the Cahn-Hilliard and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. It concludes with a rigorous mathematical formulation and analysis of the phenomena.

## 3. Non relativistic limit of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: Uniform   in time convergence of KAM solutions

**Authors:** Dario Bambusi, Andrea Belloni, Filippo Giuliani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17691v1)

**Summary:**

We study the non relativistic limit of the solutions of the cubic nonlinear Klein--Gordon (KG) equation on an interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct a family of quasi periodic solutions which, after a Gauge transformation, converge globally uniformly in time. The proof is based on KAM theory. We emphasize that, regardless of the spatial domain, all the previous results prove the convergence of KG solutions to NLS solutions only on compact time intervals. We conclude that the proof of the KG-NLS convergence can only be proved in the time domain.

## 4. Phase transitions for fractional $Φ^3_d$ on the torus

**Authors:** Niko Nikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17669v1)

**Summary:**

In a regular regime $d<3\alpha$, one can construct and normalise this measure, and obtain a measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Gaussian free field. The behaviour depends on the size $|\sigma|$ of the nonlinearity. This generalises a result of Oh, Okamoto, and Tolomeo (2025) on the $\Phi^3_3$-measure. We show a phase transition at $d=3\ alpha$.

## 5. On two families of quantum vertex algebras of FRT-type

**Authors:** Lucia Bagnoli, Marijana Butorac, Slaven Kožić

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17625v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17625v1)

**Summary:**

We consider two new families of quantum vertex algebras associated with the type $A$ trigonometric $R$-matrix. We show that their representation theory is governed by the so-called FRT- operator. In the elliptic case, we investigate the properties of the quantum determinant associated. with the corresponding quantum vertex algebra. We demonstrate some applications of this result and show how it can be applied to the eight-vertex model. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.

## 6. Constructing skew bracoids via abelian maps, and solutions to the   {Y}ang-{B}axter equation

**Authors:** Alan Koch, Paul J. Truman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17624v1)

**Summary:**

We show how one can use the skew braces constructed using abelian maps to generate families of skew bracoids as defined by Martin-Lyons and Truman. Under certain circumstances, these bracoid give right non-degenerate solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. We also show how to use skew braces to generate skew braces that give right right solutions to Yang-baxter equations. We conclude that skew braces can be used to generate right solutions for Yang- baxter equations under certain circumstances.

## 7. Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow I:   Foundations

**Authors:** François Gay-Balmaz, Álvaro Rodríguez Abella, Hiroaki Yoshimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17551v1)

**Summary:**

A new geometric approach to systems with boundary energy flow is developed using infinite-dimensional Dirac structures within the Lagrangian formalism. This framework satisfies a list of consistency criteria with the geometric setting of finite-dimensional mechanics. The approach allows for a process of system interconnection within its formulation. To illustrate our theory, several examples, including nonlinear wave equations, the telegraph equation, and the Maxwell equations are presented. The paper focuses on systems where the configuration space consists of differential forms on a smooth manifold with a boundary.

## 8. Exact new mobility edges

**Authors:** Yongjian Wang, Qi Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17523v1)

**Summary:**

Mobility edges (ME) are defined as critical energies that separate the extended states from the localized states. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of two exact new mobility edges for two physically realistic models. The proof is based on spectral analysis of singular Jacobi operator on the strip. The first ME represents the critical energy that separates the critical states from localized states; the second, referred to as Type III ME, marks the critical power that separate critical states and extended states. The paper was published in the Journal of Quantum Physics.

## 9. Detecting quantum steering in networks

**Authors:** Ming-Xiao Li, Yuqi Li, Ya Xi, Chang-Yue Zhang, Ying-Zheng Wang, Rui-Bin Xu, Shao-Ming Fei, Zhu-Jun Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17469v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17469v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum networks promise an unprecedented leap in semi-device-independent communication and security by capitalizing on quantum steering. Current methods for assessing quantum network steering are constrained to specific cases. In this work, we introduce the network-Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt-like inequality for investigating network steering independent of entanglement source characteristics. We employ this inequality to detect full network steering in both single-node and multinode repeater networks and assess the tolerance of various noise models.

## 10. Computing entanglement costs of non-local operations on the basis of   algebraic geometry

**Authors:** Seiseki Akibue, Jisho Miyazaki, Hiroyuki Osaka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17394v1)

**Summary:**

In order to realize distributed quantum computations, it is crucial to minimize the entanglement consumption of implementing non-local operations. We introduce a concept based on algebraic geometry to simplify the algebraic constraints in the optimization. By running the algorithm based on our improved DPS hierarchy, we numerically obtain the trade-off between the (one-shot)Entanglement cost and the success probability for implementing various non- local quantum operations under separable channels. We solve an open problem posed by Yu et. al. about the entangling cost for local state discrimination.
