## 0. A criterion on the free energy for log-Sobolev inequalities in   mean-field particle systems

**Authors:** R. Bauerschmidt, T. Bodineau, B. Dagallier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24372v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate a criterion in terms of the free energy that implies uniform bounds on the log-Sobolev constant of the associated Langevin dynamics. For certain double-well potentials with quadratic interaction, the criterion holds up to the critical temperature of the model. The criterion also applies to ``diluted'' mean-field models defined on sufficiently dense, possibly random graphs. The mode decomposition is different from the scale decomposition of the Polchinski flow we used for short-range spin systems.

## 1. Nonlinear-elasticity models with surface energy

**Authors:** Martin Horák, Michal Šmejkal, Martin Kružík

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24294v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24294v1)

**Summary:**

Soft solids with surface energy exhibit complex mechanical behavior. This interplay has profound implications for material design and emerging technologies. This work explores a novel class of surface-polyconvex constitutive models that account for surface energy while ensuring the existence of minimizers. These models are implemented within a finite element framework and validated through benchmark problems and applications, including, e.g., the liquid bridge problem and the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, for which the surface energy plays the dominant role.

## 2. PhD Thesis: Shifted Contact Structures on Differentiable Stacks

**Authors:** Antonio Maglio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24238v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24238v1)

**Summary:**

This thesis focuses on developing "stacky" versions of contact structures. A fruitful approach is to study contact structures using line bundle-valued $1$-forms. We introduce the notions of $0$ and $+1'-shifted contact structures on Lie groupoids. We draw inspiration from the concept of the homotopy kernel in Homological Algebra. The curvature is described by a specific RUTH morphism. Both the definitions are motivated by the Symplectic-to-Contact Dictionary.

## 3. Compressible N-phase fluid mixture models

**Authors:** M. F. P. ten Eikelder, E. H. van Brummelen, D. Schillinger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24225v1)

**Summary:**

There is a lack of consensus in the modeling of compressible mixtures, say the authors. They develop a theory for compressible, isothermal N-phase mixtures. Key aspects of the framework include its grounding in continuum mixture theory and its preservation of thermodynamic consistency despite its reduced complexity. The theory establishes a system of reduced complexity by formulating N mass balance laws alongside a single momentum balance law, the authors say. They also provide the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn model.

## 4. Quantum causality in kappa Minkoswki

**Authors:** Valentine Maris

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24192v1)

**Summary:**

Recent results on causality in noncommutative space-time are reviewed. Investigation of causality provides a quantum constraint, which is a quantum analog of the speed light limits. This later is described by a twisted Lorentzian Spectral Triple build with a twisted set of derivatives. We study, in particular, quantum causal structures in 1+1 dimensional kappa Minkowski space- time. The results are presented in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

## 5. Estimation of thermal properties and boundary heat transfer coefficient   of the ground with a Bayesian technique

**Authors:** Zhanat Karashbayeva, Julien Berger, Helcio R. B. Orlande, Marie-Hélène Azam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24072v1)

**Summary:**

Urbanization is the key contributor for climate change. Increasing urbanization rate causes an urban heat island (UHI) effect. The UHI effect strongly depends on the short- and long-wave radiation balance heat flux between the surfaces. In order to calculate accurately this heat flux, it is required to assess the surface temperature. The aim of this paper is to estimate the thermal properties of the ground and the time varying surface heat transfer coefficient by solving an inverse problem. The Dufort--Frankel scheme is applied for solving the unsteady heat transfer problem.

## 6. A Quantum Energy Inequality for a Non-commutative QFT

**Authors:** Harald Grosse, Albert Much

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24068v1)

**Summary:**

We establish a quantum energy inequality (QEI) for a quantum field theory formulated in a non-commutative spacetime. This inequality provides a fundamental bound on the expectation values of the energy density, ensuring the stability and physical consistency of the theory.

## 7. Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of   mass-deformed type IIB matrix model

**Authors:** Jumpei Gohara, Akifumi Sako

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060v1)

**Summary:**

A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. The mass-deformed IIB matrix model admits classical solutions constructed from the basis of any semisimple Lie algebra. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebraes in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size is infinite. We provide a quantization called ''weak matrix regularization'' on the algebraic variety defined by its Casimir polynomials.

## 8. Effective Dynamics and Blow Up in a Model of Magnetic Relaxation

**Authors:** Dimitri Cobb, Daniel Sánchez-Simón del Pino, Juan J. L. Velázquez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24055v1)

**Summary:**

In this article we study a one dimensional model for Magnetic Relaxation. This model describes a low resistivity viscous plasma, in which the pressure and the inercia are much smaller than the magnetic pressure. In the limit of resistivity $b_\varepsilon(t,x)$ can be approximated by the solution of a PDE whose solutions exhibit blow up for some choices of initial data. We show that in this second time scale, the modulus of magnetic field approaches a function that depends only on time.

## 9. Accelerated Airfoil Design Using Neural Network Approaches

**Authors:** Anantram Patel, Nikhil Mogre, Mandar Mane, Jayavardhan Reddy Enumula, Vijay Kumar Sutrakar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24052v1)

**Summary:**

Predicting airfoil shape from targeted pressure distribution (suction and pressure sides) and vice versa is demonstrated using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep neural Networks (DNNs) Five different CNN and DNN models are developed depending on the input/output parameters. Results demonstrate that the refined models exhibit improved efficiency, with the DNN model achieving a multi-fold reduction in training time compared to the CNN model. This research underscores the potential of deep learning models accelerating aerodynamic optimization and advancing the design of high-performance airfoils.

## 10. Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras   III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems

**Authors:** Bin Gui, Hao Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23995v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $C_2$ VOA. We also discuss the relation between conformal block and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid. In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem.

## 11. Operator limit of Wigner matrices I

**Authors:** Debapratim Banerjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23940v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23940v1)

**Summary:**

The objective of this paper is two folds. We consider the Wigner matrix $W_{n}$ of dimension $n \times n$ as $n $to \infty$ We show that the spectral measure of $\mathcal{W}$ at any function $f $in L^{2}[0,1]$ is almost surely the semicircular law. We further investigate some properties of $L^{2]$ and $H$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

## 12. Transmission resonances in scattering by $δ'$-like combs

**Authors:** Yuriy Golovaty, Rostyslav Hryniv, Stanislav Lavrynenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23837v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23837v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a new exactly solvable model in quantum mechanics that describes the propagation of particles through a potential field. We refer to the corresponding potentials as $\delta'_\theta$-combs. We explicitly calculate the scattering matrix for these systems and prove that the transmission probability exhibits sharp resonance peaks while rapidly decaying at other frequencies. Consequently, Hamiltonians with $$$-comb potentials act as quantum filters, permitting tunnelling only for specific wave frequencies. For more information, visit the Quantum Mechanics website.

## 13. Adjoint-based optimization of the Rayleigh-Bénard instability with   melting boundary

**Authors:** Tomas Fullana, Alejandro Quirós Rodríguez, Vincent Le Chenadec, Taraneh Sayadi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23831v1)

**Summary:**

A novel cut cell method is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation and the convection-diffusion equation in the fluid layer. To track the interface we use the level set method where its evolution is simply governed by an advection equation. An incomplete continuous adjoint problem is then derived by considering that the velocity field is a check-pointing variable. The results of the minimization problem with a tracking-type cost-functional show that our adjoint method is well suited to optimize the shapes of the fronts.

## 14. Exact Solution of the Frustrated Potts Model with Next-Nearest-Neighbor   Interactions in One Dimension: An AI-Aided Discovery

**Authors:** Weiguo Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23758v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23758v1)

**Summary:**

The one-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ $q$-state Potts model is solved exactly for arbitrary $q$, based on using OpenAI's latest reasoning model o3-mini-high to exactly solve the $q=3$ case. The exact results provide insights to outstanding physical problems such as the stacking of atomic or electronic orders in layered materials and the formation of a $T_c$-dome-shaped phase often seen in unconventional superconductors. The work is anticipated to fuel both the research in one- dimensional frustrated magnets for recently discovered finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic of AI for sciences.
