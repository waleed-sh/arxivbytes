## 0. Incremental universality of Wigner random matrices

**Authors:** Giovanni M. Cicuta, Mario Pernici

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03714v1)

**Summary:**

 Properties of universality have essential relevance for the theory of random matrices usually called the Wigner ensemble. We present a slightly different view and compare the large-$n$ limit of connected correlators of distinct ensembles. universality has steps or degrees, precisely counted by the number of probability moments of the matrix entries, which match among distinctEnsembles, we say. The issue was analysed up to recent years with detailed and relevant results. We conclude that universality is a property of the random matrix.

## 1. Information-theoretic reduction of deep neural networks to linear models   in the overparametrized proportional regime

**Authors:** Francesco Camilli, Daria Tieplova, Eleonora Bergamin, Jean Barbier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03577v1)

**Summary:**

We rigorously analyse fully-trained neural networks of arbitrary depth. We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching architecture. This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the "deep Gaussian equivalence principle" conjectured in Cui et al. (2023) (arXiv:2302.00375). Our result highlights that in order to escape this "trivialisation" of deep neural Networks, models trained from much more data have to be considered.

## 2. Blobbed topological recursion and KP integrability

**Authors:** Alexander Alexandrov, Boris Bychkov, Petr Dunin-Barkowski, Maxim Kazarian, Sergey Shadrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03545v1)

**Summary:**

We revise the notion of the blobbed topological recursion. We show that the so-called non-perturbative differentials form a special case of this revisited version. We prove the KP integrability of the differentials for input data that include KP-integrable blobs. This result generalizes, unifies, and gives a new proof of the KP integration of nonperturbable differentials conjectured by Borot--Eynard and recently proved by the authors.

## 3. A generalised non-linear reconstructor for all Fourier-type wavefront   sensors

**Authors:** Victoria Laidlaw

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03477v1)

**Summary:**

State-of-the-art adaptive optics (AO) systems perform non-linear Fourier-type wavefront sensing for real-time corrections of dynamic wavefront aberrations. This general class of sensors uses a filtering mask in the focal plane that converts phase fluctuations of the incoming light into intensity variations in the subsequent pupil plane. Conventionally, linear methods, like a matrix- vector-multiplication (MVM), are used for the inversion of Fouriers. However, their non- linear behavior gives rise to severe performance degradations when significant channel perturbations are observed.

## 4. Non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged WZW models

**Authors:** José M Figueroa-O'Farrill, Girish S Vishwa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03462v1)

**Summary:**

We construct non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged Wess--Zumino--Witten models. Lie groups with a bi-invariant galilean structure can be seen as the quotient by a null central subgroup. We use a particular free field realisation of the Nappi --Witten current algebra to compute the Virasoro BRST cohomology of the gauge WZW model. This results in a closed string theory reminiscent of the bosonic Gomis--Ooguri string, but whose spectrum differs between the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors.

## 5. Two Layer Model via Non Quasi Periodic Normal Form Theory

**Authors:** Gabriella Pinzari, Benedetto Scoppola, Matteo Veglianti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03436v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03436v1)

**Summary:**

The two layer model is a 2+1/2 degrees of freedom non autonomous dynamical system. The lower order expansion exhibits capture in resonance, numerically detected in a previous paper by the authors. In this paper, we reframe the model along the lines of a suitable version of (which we refer to as non quasi periodic) normal form theory. We provide an explicit amount of the resonance trapping time, which is estimated as exponentially long, in terms of the small parameters of the system.

## 6. Joyce structures and poles of Painlevé equations

**Authors:** Tom Bridgeland, Fabrizio Del Monte

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03429v1)

**Summary:**

Joyce structures are a class of geometric structures that first arose in relation to Donaldson-Thomas theory. We study two Joyce structures of this type using the isomonodromic systems associated to the Painlev\'e II and III$_3$ equations. The systematic treatment gives a blueprint for the study of more general Joyce structures associated to meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere. We show that the behaviour of the Joyce structure near the zero-section can be studied analytically through poles of Painlev’s equations.

## 7. On the strong unique continuation property for the Dirac operator

**Authors:** Biagio Cassano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03421v1)

**Summary:**

In [DO99,KY99], we establish the strong unique continuation property for the Dirac operator from the point at infinity. Also, we show properties of unique continuation from the origin for solutions to the inequality $|D_n u | \leq \frac{C}{ |x|^{\gamma}}|u|$, for $C>0$ We show that $C<\frac12$ is the largest possibile constant in this result, providing an example of a (non-trivial) solution of the inequality.

## 8. On the local constancy of regularized superdeterminants along special   families of differential operators

**Authors:** Michele Schiavina, Thomas Stucker

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03404v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03404v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the flat-regularized determinant of families of operators of the form $D_\tau. We show that under suitable assumptions, both geometrical and analytical in nature, this determinant is constant. The general result we present implies both local constancy of the Ray--Singer torsion and of the value at zero of the Ruelle zeta function for a contact Anosov flow. We conclude that this result implies both the Ray-Singer and contact-Anosov torsions to be constant.

## 9. Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: Fourier dimensions of   classical multiplicative chaos measures

**Authors:** Zhaofeng Lin, Yanqi Qiu, Mingjie Tan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. We obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative Chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier Dimensions. In various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact value of the fourier dimensions. We conclude by saying that we have found the optimal models.

## 10. Poincar{é}-Steklov operator and Calder{ó}n's problem on extension   domains

**Authors:** Gabriel Claret, Michael Hinz, Anna Rozanova-Pierrat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03277v1)

**Summary:**

We consider Calder{\'o}n's problem on a class of Sobolev extension domains containing non-Lipschitz and fractal shapes. We generalize the notion of Poincar{\'e}-Steklov (Dirichlet-to-Neumann) operator for the conductivity problem on such domains. From there, we prove the stability of the direct problem for bounded conductivities continuous near the boundary. Then, we turn to the inverse problem and prove its stability at the boundary for Lipschitzer conductivities.

## 11. Solitary wave-mean flow interaction in strongly nonlineardispersive   shallow water waves

**Authors:** Thibault Congy, Gennady El, Sergey Gavrilyuk, Mark Hoefer, Keh-Ming Shyue

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03252v1)

**Summary:**

The interaction of a solitary wave and a slowly varying mean background or flow for the Serre-Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations is studied using Whitham modulation theory. The Riemann invariants are used to analytically describe the head-on and overtaking interactions. The analytical results are favourably compared with corresponding numerical solutions of the full SGN equations. Because the SGN equation model the bi-directional propagation of strongly nonlinear, long gravity waves over a flat bottom, the analysis describes large amplitude solitary wave-mean flow interactions in shallow water waves.

## 12. Comparison of Extensions of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebras and   Conformal Nets

**Authors:** Bin Gui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03235v1)

**Summary:**

Let $V$ be one of the following unitary strongly-rational VOAs: unitary WZW models, discrete series W-algebras of type ADE, even lattice VOAs, parafermion VOAs. Let $U$ be a (unitary) VOA extension of $V$, described by a Q-system $Q$.   We prove that $U $ is strongly local. We show that the CWX $*$-functor from the $C^*$ category of unitary $ U$- modules to the finite-index CWX category is naturally isomorphic to $*'

## 13. Riemann-Hilbert problem and long-time asymptotics to the combined   Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa and short-pulse equation on the line

**Authors:** Yidan Yang, Engui Fan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03144v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we develop a Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach to the Cauchy problem for the combined Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa and short-pulse (WKI-SP) equation. The solution is first expressed in terms of the solution of a RH problem with direct scattering transform based on the Lax pair. We obtain the long-time asymptotic approximations to the solution under a new scale $(y,t)$ in three kinds of space-time regions.

## 14. Analytic Expressions for Most $f^n$ Valence Multiplet Eigenvalues

**Authors:** Thomas P. Devereaux

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03107v1)

**Summary:**

In this note, I show that all multiplet eigenstates for most $f^n$ configurations can be obtained analytically. I correct prior misprints in the literature and present new results for $f$-electrons. These results can serve as checks against new and developed numerical codes, and further provide experimentalists with deeper insights into the many configurations probed by advanced x-ray spectroscopies. The results can be used to identify effect valence configuration of transition metal ions as well as their ligands.
