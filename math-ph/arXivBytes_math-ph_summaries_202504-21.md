## 0. On Refined Vogel's universality

**Authors:** Liudmila Bishler, Andrei Mironov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13831v1)

**Summary:**

In accordance with P. Vogel, a set of algebra structures in Chern-Simons theory can be made universal, independent of a particular family of simple Lie algebras. We support this conjecture by analysing the Macdonald dimensions, i.e. values of Macdonald polynomials at $q^\rho$, where $\rho$ is the Weyl vector. There is a universality formula that describes these dimensions for the simply laced algebraes as a function on the Vogel's plane.

## 1. A new quasi-lisse affine vertex algebra of type $D_4$

**Authors:** Dražen Adamović, Ivana Vukorepa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13783v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13783v1)

**Summary:**

We conjecture that $L_{k_m}(D_4)$ is quasi-lisse for every $m. We prove this conjecture for $m=1$, by using mostly computational methods. We show that the maximal ideal in the universal affine vertex algebra is generated by three singular vectors of conformal weight six. We apply Zhu's theory and classify all irreducible $L k_1 (D 4) -- modules. Finally, we prove that the associated variety is contained in the nilpotent cone of $D_ 4.

## 2. A dynamical Amrein-Berthier uncertainty principle

**Authors:** Piero D'Ancona, Diego Fiorletta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13746v1)

**Summary:**

Given a selfadjoint magnetic Schr\"odinger operator, we prove that the flow $u(t)$ satisfies an Amrein--Berthier type inequality. Under different assumptions on the operator, which allow for time--dependent coefficients, the result extends to sets $E,F$ of finite measure. We also consider a few variants for Schr\"{o}dinger operators with singular coefficients, metaplectic operators, and we include applications to control theory. In particular, if both $u (0)$ and $U(T)$ are compactly supported, then $u$ vanishes identically.

## 3. High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks

**Authors:** Yue Wan, Robert Rosenbaum

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727v1)

**Summary:**

Many networks that arise in nature and applications are effectively low-dimensional in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks might also be low- dimensional. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. We show that recurrent networks with low-rank structure often produce high-dimensional dynamics in the presence of high- dimensional perturbations. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.

## 4. A microlocal Cauchy problem through a crossing point of Hamiltonian   flows

**Authors:** Kenta Higuchi, Vincent Louatron, Kouichi Taira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13693v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we consider $2\times 2$ matrix-valued pseudodifferential equations in which the two characteristic sets intersect with finite contact order. We show that the asymptotic behavior of its solution changes dramatically before and after the crossing point. This is a generalization of the previous results for Matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators and Landau-Zener models. The proof relies on a normal form reduction and a detailed analysis of a simple first-order system.

## 5. Limiting absorption principle for long-range perturbation in a graphene   setting

**Authors:** Nassim Athmouni, Marwa Ennaceur, Sylvain Golenia, Amel Jadlaoui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13512v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we examine the discrete Laplacian acting on a hexagonal lattice by introducing long-range modifications in both the metric and the potential. Our objective is to establish a Limiting Absorption Principle, excluding possible embedded eigenvalues. To this end, we employ the positive commutator technique as our method.

## 6. Accurate semiclassical analysis of light propagation on tilted   hyperplanes

**Authors:** Patrick Gioia, San Vu Ngoc

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13485v1)

**Summary:**

In the scalar light model given by Helmholtz' equation in R^{1+d} , we consider the transformation of an initial scene. In the high frequency regime, we use microlocal and semiclassical analysis to describe the propagator as a Fourier integral operator. We then prove new precise Egorov theorems, including subprincipal terms, which indicate how to take into account the propagation along rays of geometric optics. The results are published in a book called Theoretical Physics of Light.

## 7. Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons

**Authors:** Antoine Levitt, Douglas Lundholm, Nicolas Rougerie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481v1)

**Summary:**

Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results.
