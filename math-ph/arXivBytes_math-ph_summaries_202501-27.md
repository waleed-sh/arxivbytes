## 0. Super-Hamiltonians for super-Macdonald polynomials

**Authors:** Dmitry Galakhov, Alexei Morozov, Nikita Tselousov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14714v1)

**Summary:**

The Macdonald finite-difference Hamiltonian is lifted to a super-generalization. Peculiarities of the construction in comparison to the canonical bosonic case are discussed. Eigenfunctions for this Hamiltonian are a suitable generalization of Macdonald polynomials to super-Macdonald poynomials discussed earlier in the literature. The Hamiltonian can be represented as a differential operator acting on a space of functions of both types of variables $p_k$ and $theta_k.

## 1. Limit theorems for the number of sign and level-set clusters of the   Gaussian free field

**Authors:** Michael McAuley, Stephen Muirhead

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14707v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14707v1)

**Summary:**

We study the limiting fluctuations of the number of sign and level-set clusters of the Gaussian free field. We prove that the fluctuations are Gaussian at all non-critical levels. To our knowledge this is the first time that chaos expansion techniques have been applied to analyse a non-local functional of a strongly correlated Gaussian field. Our proof is based on controlling the Weiner-It\^{o} chaos expansion of the cluster count using percolation theoretic inputs. We also show that the sign clusters experience a form of Berry cancellation in all dimensions.

## 2. Mean-field limit from general mixtures of experts to quantum neural   networks

**Authors:** Anderson Melchor Hernandez, Davide Pastorello, Giacomo De Palma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14660v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of Mixture of Experts (MoE) trained via gradient flow on supervised learning problems. Our main result establishes the propagation of chaos for a MoE as the number of experts diverges. We demonstrate that the corresponding empirical measure of their parameters is close to a probability measure that solves a nonlinear continuity equation. We provide an explicit convergence rate that depends solely on the number. of experts. We apply our results to aMoE generated by a quantum neural network.

## 3. Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar   bosons: Scattering and bound states

**Authors:** Luis B. Castro, Antonio S. de Castro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorenz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies. We conclude that the presence of a specific LorentZ symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states.

## 4. A countable Boolean algebra that is Reichenbach's common cause complete

**Authors:** Dominika Burešová

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14567v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14567v1)

**Summary:**

Common cause completeness (CCC) is a philosophical principle that asserts that if we consider two positively correlated events then it evokes a common cause. The principle is due to H. Reichenbach and has been largely studied in Boolean algebras and elsewhere. The results published so far bring about a question whether there is a small (countable) Boolean algebra with CCC. In this note we construct such an example. We then ask if there is an example of a CCC-based Boolean algebra.

## 5. Saturated Fell bundles and their classification

**Authors:** Natã Machado, Stefan Wagner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14472v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14472v1)

**Summary:**

We present a comprehensive classification theory for saturated Fell bundles over locally compact groups. This framework offers a unified approach to understanding the structure and properties of such bundles. It also provides key insights into their classification. We use data associated with their base group and unit fiber. We present a comprehensive classification of saturated Fell bundles over locally compact groups. We use data associated with their base group and unit fiber to understand their structures.

## 6. Homoenergetic solutions for the Rayleigh-Boltzmann equation: existence   of a stationary non-equilibrium solution

**Authors:** Nicola Miele, Alessia Nota, Juan J. L. Velázquez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14454v1)

**Summary:**

Homoenergetic solutions describe the dynamics of Boltzmann gases under the effect of different mechanical deformations. The long-time behaviour of these solutions cannot be described by Maxwellian distributions and it strongly depends on the homogeneity of the collision kernel of the equation. We first prove a well-posedness result for this class of solutions in the space of non-negative Radon measures. We then prove the existence of a stationary solution under the non-equilibrium condition which is induced by the presence of the shear deformation.

## 7. $p$-adic symplectic geometry of integrable systems and   Weierstrass-Williamson theory

**Authors:** Luis Crespo, Álvaro Pelayo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14444v1)

**Summary:**

We establish the foundations of the local linear symplectic geometry of $p$-adic integrable systems on $4$-dimensional manifolds. In order to do this we develop a new approach, of independent interest, to the theory of Weierstrass and Williamson concerning the diagonalization of real matrices by real symplectic matrices. The paper also includes a number of results concerning symplectic linear algebra over arbitrary fields in arbitrary dimensions. These results fit in a program, proposed a decade ago by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author, to develop a $p-$-adic theory of Integrable Systems.

## 8. Mesoscopic Edge Universality of Orthogonal Polynomial Ensembles

**Authors:** Wenkui Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14422v1)

**Summary:**

Main result is a Central limit Theorem (CLT) for linear statistics at mesoscopic scales. We show that if the recurrence coefficients for the associated orthogonal polynomials are slowly varying, a universal CLT holds. Particular examples to which our CLT applies are Jacobi, Laguerre and Gaussian unitary ensembles as well as discreteEnsembles from random tilings. We prove an estimate for the resolvent of Jacobi matrices with slowly varying entries.

## 9. The superadiabatic projectors method applied to the spectral theory of   magnetic operators

**Authors:** Lino Benedetto, Clotilde Fermanian Kammerer, Nicolas Raymond, Éric Vacelet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14388v1)

**Summary:**

This article deals with a generalization of the superadiabatic projectors method. We apply these ideas to spectral theory. We explain how our abstract results allow to recover or improve recent results about the semiclassical magnetic Laplacian. We conclude with an overview of the current state of the science of spectral theory and the theory of LaplACs. The article is based on a paper published in the Journal of Spectral Theory and Theory.

## 10. On computation of Darboux polynomials for full Toda lattice

**Authors:** A. V. Tsiganov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14251v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14251v1)

**Summary:**

One of the oldest methods for computing invariants of ordinary differential equations is tested using the full Toda lattice model. We show that the standard method of undetermined coefficients and modern symbolic algebra tools together with sufficient computing power allow to compute Darboux invariants without any additional information. The results are published in the open-source version of the book, "Darboux Equations: Theoretical and Practical Applications", published by Oxford University Press, London, UK, on November 14, 2013.

## 11. A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States

**Authors:** Agnes Beaudry, Michael Hermele, Markus J. Pflaum, Marvin Qi, Daniel D. Spiegel, David T. Stephen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a topological space $B$ of all physical and bond dimensions. We show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(X) \times K(Z)$. The phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants. The space is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $E$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} is a quasifibration.

## 12. Mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for toric GIT quotients via Fourier   transform

**Authors:** Konstantin Aleshkin, Bohan Fang, Junxiao Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14222v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the Fourier transform of the $G$-equivariant quantum cohomology central charge of a line bundle on a toric Fano orbifold. Moving these parameters to real numbers simultaneously deforms the integration cycle to the mirror Lagrangian cycle of that line bundle. This computation produces a new proof the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for $\mathcal X$. We conclude that the conjecture is true for all $G' line bundles on $X' with certain choice of parameters.
