## 0. The DC Kerr Effect in Nonlinear Optics

**Authors:** Nikolas Eptaminitakis, Plamen Stefanov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01392v1)

**Summary:**

The Kerr electro-optic effect is used to build fast switches. We prove existence of an exact solution of the nonlinear Maxwell system with a cubic Kerr nonlinearity. We justify the effect within this model, and also solve the inverse problem of recovery of theNonlinear susceptibility from the change of the polarization. We use weakly nonlinear geometric optics to study a model for the DC Kerr effect (the Kerr Electro-Optic effect) and to prove the existence of the effect.

## 1. Para-associative Algebroids

**Authors:** Andrew James Bruce

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01350v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01350v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce para-associative algebroids as vector bundles whose sections form a ternary algebra with a generalised form of associativity. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for local triviality is the existence of a differential connection, i.e. a connection that satisfies the Leibniz rule over the ternaries product. We also show that the connection must be a generalisation of the terN product, not just a special case of the generalised terN algebra.

## 2. Diffusivity of the Lorentz mirror walk in high dimensions

**Authors:** Dor Elboim, Antoine Gloria, Felipe Hernández

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01341v1)

**Summary:**

In the Lorentz mirror walk in dimension $d\geq 2$ mirrors are randomly placed on the vertices of $p\in[0,1]$. A light ray is then shot from the origin and deflected through the various mirrors in space. The object of study is the random trajectory obtained in this way. A folklore conjecture states that for $d=2$ these trajectories are finite for any density $p>0. In this paper we prove that the trajectories behave diffusively at all polynomial time scales $t\approx p^{-M}$ with $M>1$

## 3. Recurrence of the VRJP and Exponential Decay in the \(H^{2|2}\)-Model on   the Hierarchical Lattice for \(d\le 2\)

**Authors:** Jinglin Wang, Xiaolin Zeng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01337v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the vertices-reinforced jump processes on a hierarchical lattice are recurrent and transient. The proof of recurrence relies on an exponential decay estimate of the fractional moment of the Green's function. This requires additional entropy estimates via stability of the model distribution under coarse grain operation, which leverages its linear reinforcement. We also explore certain regimes when \(\mathbb{Z}^d\) is greater than 2. We conclude that the lattice is recurrent for \(d < 2\) and transient for \( d > 2\).

## 4. Dynamical dark energy and gravitational coupling from moving geometries

**Authors:** Jean Thibaut

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01312v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce the notion of moving Cartan geometries described by quotients of Lie groups and Lie algebras with spacetime dependant structure constants. We compute the equations of motion of the gauge + matter actions and show that they dictate at each spacetime point the geometry. This leads to both a dynamical source of dark energy and a gravitational coupling, described by combinations of scalars built from spacetime curvature, torsion and the matter content of the theory. We conclude that the theory is a model of the universe.

## 5. $η$ regularisation and the functional measure

**Authors:** Robert G. C. Smith, Murdock Grewar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01290v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. We explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function that encodes this dependence. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism.

## 6. Ind-cluster algebras and infinite Grassmannians

**Authors:** Sira Gratz, Christian Korff

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01228v1)

**Summary:**

A cluster algebra is a coordinate ring of a finite Grassmannian. Using the Pl\"ucker embedding the cluster algebra structure allows one to move between `maximal sets' of algebraically independent coordinates via mutations. Fioresi and Hacon studied a specific colimit of the coordinate rings of finite Grassmanians and its link with the infinite Grassmanian introduced by Sato and independently by Segal and Wilson. They prove that this ring is a cluster algebra of infinite rank with the structure induced by the Colimit construction.

## 7. A swap-based mixer for the TSP: theoretical considerations,   implementation and experiments

**Authors:** E. Bourreau, G. Fleury, P. Lacomme

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01214v1)

**Summary:**

This paper explores quantum heuristics based on Mixer Hamiltonians, which enable the restriction of investigations to a specific subspace. The experiment carried on a 5-customers TSP instances proves the mixer efficiency. Our objective is to define a swap based mixer for the TSP to investigate only during QAOA, the qubit-strings that modelize TSP solution. We can define MixerHamiltonians as mapping functions that transform qubit strings into solution sets. The paper was published in the Journal of Quantum Theory.

## 8. Stochastic Hartree NLS in 3d coming from a Many-Body Quantum System with   White Noise Potential

**Authors:** Francesco Carlo De Vecchi, Xiaohao Ji, Immanuel Zachhuber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01157v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we consider the defocusing Hartree NLS with white noise external potential on T^3. A Strichartz-type estimate is established for the Anderson Hamiltonian using perturbative arguments. We prove the convergence of the linear Schr\"odinger equation for the many body system to the BBGKY hierarchy for the Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, we establish the Anderson Hartrees NLS as an effective equation describing many-body Bosonic systems and, in particular, we prove that the NLS can be used to describe many body systems.

## 9. On the structuree of homogeneous local Poisson brackets

**Authors:** Guido Carlet, Matteo Casati

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01138v1)

**Summary:**

We consider an arbitrary Dubrovin-Novikov bracket of degree $k. We show that $k$ connections, defined by explicit linear combinations with constant coefficients of the standard connections associated with the Poisson bracket, are flat. We also show that the connections are flat if and only if they are linear combinations of linear combinations. We conclude that the flat connections are the same as the linear combinations defined by linear combinations and constant coefficients. We call this result the flatness of the connections on a smooth manifold $M$

## 10. Capillary liquid channels in cylindrical support surfaces: stability and   bifurcation

**Authors:** Rafael López

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01114v1)

**Summary:**

Planes and circular cylinders are models of interfaces of a fluid when the support surface is translationally invariant in a direction of the space. This analysis depends on the curvature of the support at the contact points with the interface. The Plateau-Rayleigh instability phenomenon is studied finding the critical value $h_0>0$ such that rectangular pieces of planar strips are necessarily unstable. It is also studied when new morphologies of capillary surfaces can emerge from given circular cylinders. It will be presented examples of supports (parabolic and catenary cylinders) where this bifurcation appears.

## 11. New convolution related theorems and applications associated with offset   linear canonical transform

**Authors:** Gita Rani Mahato, Sarga Varghese, Manab Kundu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01046v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01046v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we define new type of convolution and correlation theorems associated with the offset linear canonical transform (OLCT) We discuss their applications in multiplicative filter design, which may prove useful in optics and signal processing for signal recovery. Furthermore, we explore the real Paley-Wiener (PW) and Boas theorem for the OLCT, analyzing signal characteristics for OLCT within the L2 domain. We conclude with a discussion of the applications of the new theoresms.
