## 0. Invariance principle for the Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos via a high   dimensional CLT with low rank increments

**Authors:** Mriganka Basu Roy Chowdhury, Shirshendu Ganguly

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17412v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17412v1)

**Summary:**

Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) is a canonical random fractal measure. It has served as an important building block in constructions of quantum field theories and Liouville quantum gravity. In many natural settings, non-Gaussian log-correlated processes arise. This solves the main open problem from Kim and Kriechbaum (2024) who had earlier established such a result for a part of the regime. The main ingredient is a new high dimensional CLT for a sum of independent (but not i.d.) random vectors belonging to rank one subspaces.

## 1. Singular diffusion limit of a tagged particle in zero range processes   with Sinai-type random environment

**Authors:** Marcel Hudiani, Claudio Landim, Sunder Sethuraman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17365v1)

**Summary:**

We derive a singular diffusion limit for the position of a tagged particle in zero range interacting particle processes on a one dimensional torus with a Sinai-type random environment via two steps. In the first step, a regularization is introduced by averaging the random environment over an $\varepsilon N$-neighborhood. With respect to such an environment, the microscopic drift of the tagged particle is in form $W_\vare psilon'$, where $W'$ is a regularized White noise. Scaling diffusively, we find the nonequilibrium limit of the tagging particle $x^\varpsilon_t$ is the unique weak solution of $d x_t^{\v

## 2. Travel Time Reliability in Stochastic Kinematic Flow Models

**Authors:** Alexander Hammerl, Ravi Seshadri, Thomas Kjær Rasmussen, Otto Anker Nielsen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17359v1)

**Summary:**

This paper analyzes the time-dependent relationship between the mean and variance of travel time on a single corridor under rush hour like congestion patterns. To model this phenomenon, we apply the LWR theory on a homogenous freeway with a discontinuous bottleneck at its downstream end. It is demonstrated that shapes of the fundamental diagram which always produce a counterclockwise loop can be interpreted as an indication of aggressive driving behavior, while deviations may occur under defensive driving. The obtained results aim to improve the fundamental understanding of the physical causes of this hysteresis pattern.

## 3. Tunneling between magnetic wells in two dimensions

**Authors:** Søren Fournais, Yannick Guedes Bonthonneau, Léo Morin, Nicolas Raymond

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17290v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum tunneling is the first result of quantum tunneling between purely magnetic wells under generic assumptions. The proof, which strongly relies on microlocal analysis, reveals a purely magnetic Agmon distance between the wells. Surprisingly, it is discovered that the exponential decay of the eigenfunctions away from the magnetic wells is not crucial to derive the tunneling formula. The key is a microlocal exponential decay inside the characteristic manifold, with respect to the variable quantizing the classical center guide motion.

## 4. Homogeneous bi-Hamiltonian structures and integrable contact systems

**Authors:** Leonardo Colombo, Manuel de León, María Emma Eyrea Irazú, Asier López-Gordón

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17269v1)

**Summary:**

Bi-Hamiltonian structures can be utilised to compute a maximal set of functions in involution for certain integrable systems. We show that the recursion operator relating two compatible Jacobi structures cannot produce a maximalSet of functions. However, as we illustrate with an example, bi-Hamiltonians can still be used to obtain a maximal Set of functions on a contact manifold, at the cost of symplectisation. We conclude that bi- Hamiltonians can be used in a variety of ways to solve problems.

## 5. Peakons and pseudo-peakons of higher order b-family equations

**Authors:** Si-Yu Zhu, Ruo-Xia Yao, De-Xing Kong, S. Y. Lou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17211v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17211v1)

**Summary:**

The peakon equations have garnered significant attention due to their rich mathematical structure and potential applications in various physical contexts. We conjecture the existence of a b-independent pseudo-peakon solution of the form, $v=c\left(1+\left|x-ct\right|) for all $J\geq 2$. We conclude that there are one b- independent peakon, two b-dependent peakons, and $J-3$ (for odd J) or $ J-4$ ( for even J) complex peakons.

## 6. Proof of the polar decomposition of the Wiener measure

**Authors:** V. V. Belokurov, E. T. Shavgulidze, N. E. Shavgulidze

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17201v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17201v1)

**Summary:**

Polar decomposition of the Wiener measure according to the orbits of the group of diffeomorphisms. In the paper, we give the proof of the polar decomposition in terms of the orbit of the diffeomorphic group. We show that this decomposition is the same for all different Wiener measures. We also show that it is also possible to decompose the measure into a more general form. We conclude that this is the case for all other Wiener Measures, and it is a proof of their existence.

## 7. A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat   Conducting Viscous Fluids

**Authors:** François Gay-Balmaz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17079v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17079v1)

**Summary:**

Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that extends the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment.

## 8. Conformal welding and the matter--Liouville--ghost factorisation

**Authors:** Guillaume Baverez, Antoine Jego

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17076v1)

**Summary:**

The main novelty of our work is a Cameron--Martin-type formula for the welding homeomorphism of the SLE loop measure. Its proof relies on a rigorous interpretation (and computation) of the "Jacobian" of the conformal welding map. We also give an intrinsic definition of the trace of the GFF on SLE, and prove a characterisation of the free boundary GFF in $\mathbb{D}$. As an application, we introduce a new and intrinsic approach to the conformals welding of quantum surfaces.

## 9. Extended Cellular Automata

**Authors:** Pouya Mehdipour, Mostafa Salarinoghabi, Paula Gibrim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17065v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, the one-dimensional Cellular Automaton is extended to one that involves two sets of symbols and two global rules. As a main result, the Extended Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon Theorem is demonstrated. Such constructions can be useful in studying complex systems involving two related phenomena and provide a way to their co-study.

## 10. Expression of special stretched $9j$ coefficients in terms of $_5F_4$   hypergeometric series

**Authors:** Jean-Christophe Pain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17008v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17008v1)

**Summary:**

In general, non-trivial $9j$ symbols can not be expressed as a $_5F_4$. In this letter, we show, using the Dougall-Ramanujan identity, that special stretched $9J$ symbol series can be reformulated as a $5F-4(1)$ hypergeometric series. We also show that $6j$ and $3j$ coefficients are proportional to a $4F-3(1), not a $3F-2(1).

## 11. On a family of Poisson brackets on gl(n) compatible with the Sklyanin   bracket

**Authors:** Vladimir V. Sokolov, Dmitry V. Talalaev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16925v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16925v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study a family of compatible quadratic Poisson brackets on gl(n), generalizing the Sklyanin one. For any of the brackets in the family, the argument shift determines the compatible linear bracket. The main interest for us is the use of the bi-Hamiltonian formalism for some pencils from this family, as a method for constructing involutive subalgebras. A similar property arises in the context of Poisson structures consistent with cluster transformations.
