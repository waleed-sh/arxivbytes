## 0. Fluctuation Relations associated to an arbitrary bijection in path space

**Authors:** Raphael Chetrite, Stefano Marcantoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16369v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations. We also provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely Stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes.

## 1. Modular transport in two-dimensional conformal field theory

**Authors:** Mihail Mintchev, Diego Pontello, Erik Tonni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16368v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quantum transport generated by the bipartite entanglement in two-dimensional conformal field theory at finite density. The modular analogues of the Johnson-Nyquist law and of the fluctuation-dissipation relation are found, which encode the thermal nature of the modular evolution. We investigate the mean values of the associated currents and their quantum fluctuations in the finite density representation, which describe the properties of the Modular quantum transport. We conclude that the modular quantum transport is a form of quantum teleportation.

## 2. A phase transition for the two-dimensional random field Ising/FK-Ising   model

**Authors:** Chenxu Hao, Fenglin Huang, Aoteng Xia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16268v1)

**Summary:**

We study the total variation (TV) distance between the laws of the 2D Ising/FK-Ising model in a box of side-length $N$ with and without an i.i.d. Letting the external field strength. depend on the size of the box, we derive a phase transition. for each model depending on the order of $\epsilon(N)$. For the random field Ising model, the critical order for $\epSilon$ is $N^{-1}$.

## 3. Modulated phases in Ising systems with long-range antiferromagnetic and   short-range ferromagnetic interactions

**Authors:** Andrea Braides, Fabrizio Caragiulo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16230v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16230v1)

**Summary:**

We consider large spin systems with short-range ferromagnetic interactions. We show that they consist of a finite number of modulated phases of the same form as minimizers with some interfacial defects. The analysis is carried out using the notation of Gamma-convergence by exhibiting an interfacial energy that describes the minimal defect energy between different modulated phase. We consider states with energy of the the same order as that of minimizers. We conclude that the state of a large spin system is a state with an energy of $1$ and $-1$.

## 4. Super-Higher-Form Symmetries

**Authors:** P. A. Grassi, S. Penati

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16182v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16182v1)

**Summary:**

Using a supergeometry formulation, we find that ordinary higher-form-symmetries nicely combine with supersymmetry to give rise to a much larger spectrum of topological conserved (super)currents. These can be classified as a supersymmetric version of Chern-Weil symmetries, and a brand new set of geometric-Chern-Weils. For N=1 super-Maxwell theory in various dimensions, we build the topological operators generating these super-higher-form symmetry and construct defects carrying non-trivial charges.

## 5. Conditions for sectoriality and compactness of the resolvent for a   non-self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville operator with singular distributional   potential

**Authors:** Sergey N. Tumanov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16172v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16172v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of this paper is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for sectoriality and compactness of the resolvent for Sturm--Liouville operators with complex-valued potentials of the class $q\in W_{2,loc}^{-1}(\mathbb{R}_+)$ In terms of its generalized antiderivatives $s\in L_2, Loc (L-R) + L-R (L-L)$.

## 6. Event Soliton Formation in Mixed Energy-Momentum Gaps of Nonlinear   Spacetime Crystals

**Authors:** Liang Zhang, Zhiwei Fan, Yiming Pan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16113v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16113v1)

**Summary:**

We report the formation of a novel soliton in nonlinear photonic spacetime crystals. Under Kerr nonlinearity, the event solitons emerge as fully localized entities in both spacetime and energy-momentum domains. Our work opens avenues for fundamental studies and fosters experimental prospects for implementing Spacetime crystals in both time-varying photonics and periodically driven condensed matter systems. We propose a new partial differential equation to capture various spatiotemporal patterns and present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical predictions.

## 7. Constraint Phase Space Formulations for Finite-State Quantum Systems:   The Relation between Commutator Variables and Complex Stiefel Manifolds

**Authors:** Youhao Shang, Xiangsong Cheng, Jian Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16062v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16062v1)

**Summary:**

We have recently developed the generalized CPS formulation for finite-state quantum systems. It has been implemented for the electronic subsystem in nonadiabatic transition dynamics to develop practical trajectory-based approaches. It is expected that the CPS formulation has implications for simulations of both nonadi Abysmal transition dynamics and many-body quantum dynamics for spins/bosons/fermions. We also discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite.

## 8. Derivation of Hartree-Fock Dynamics and Semiclassical Commutator   Estimates for Fermions in a Magnetic Field

**Authors:** Niels Benedikter, Chiara Boccato, Domenico Monaco, Ngoc Nhi Nguyen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16001v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16001v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quantum dynamics of a large number of interacting fermionic particles in a constant magnetic field. In a coupled mean-field and semiclassical scaling limit, we show that solutions of the many-body Schr\"odinger equation converge to solutions of a non-linear Hartree-Fock equation. We then propagate these bounds from the initial data along the Hartree/Fock flow to arbitrary times. We prove their validity for non-interacting initial data in a magnetic field by generalizing a 2020 result of Fournais and Mikkelsen.

## 9. General Classification, Invariance and Conservation Laws Analyses of   Nonlinear Fourth Order Wave and Nerve Membrane Equations with Dissipation

**Authors:** Ali Raza, F M Mahomed, F D Zaman, A H Kara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15859v1)

**Summary:**

We study the nonlinear wave equation for arbitrary function with fourth order dissipation. A special case that is analysed exclusively is the model of nerve membranes. The equivalence transformations, Lie symmetries and a complete classification is presented. We also discuss the one dimensional optimal system in each case obtained via classification. The reduction of the partial differential equations (PDEs) is carried out and the forms of invariant solutions are presented. The study also include the construction of conservation laws using the direct method.
