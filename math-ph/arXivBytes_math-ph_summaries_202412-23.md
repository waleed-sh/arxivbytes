## 0. Full S-matrices and Witten diagrams with (relative) L-infinity algebras

**Authors:** Luigi Alfonsi, Leron Borsten, Hyungrok Kim, Martin Wolf, Charles Alastair Stephen Young

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16106v1)

**Summary:**

The $L_\infty$-algebra approach to scattering amplitudes elegantly describes the nontrivial part of the $S$-matrix but fails to take into account the trivial part. We argue that the trivial contribution should be accounted for by another, complementary $L-Algebra. This construction reproduces Witten diagrams that arise in AdS/CFT including, in particular, the trivial Witten diagram corresponding to CFT two-point functions. We also discuss Chern-Simons theory and Yang-Mills theory on manifolds with boundaries using this approach.

## 1. Eigenvalue Bounds for Multi-Particle Reduced Density Matrices of   Coulombic Wavefunctions

**Authors:** Peter Hearnshaw

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16073v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16073v1)

**Summary:**

For bound states of atoms and molecules of $N$ electrons we consider the corresponding $K$-particle reduced density matrices. Previously, eigenvalue bounds were obtained in the case of $K=1$ and $N-1$ by A.V. Sobolev. The purpose of the current work is to obtain bounds in theCase of $2 \le K \le N-2$. For such $K $ we label the eigenvalues of the positive, trace class operators by $\Gamma^{(K)$ for $n=1,2,\dots$

## 2. Approximation of Schrödinger operators with point interactions on   bounded domains

**Authors:** Diego Noja, Raffaele Scandone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16056v1)

**Summary:**

We consider Schr\"odinger operators on a bounded domain. The singular interaction is approximated by rescaled sequences of regular potentials. The result is missing in the literature, and we also point out some general issues in the approximation of point interactions and the role of zero energy resonances. We show that, under suitable spectral assumptions, and by means of an extension-restriction procedure which exploit the already known result on the entire space, the singular interaction can be approximated using regular potential sequences.

## 3. Entropy maximizers for kinetic wave equations set on tori

**Authors:** Miguel Escobedo, Pierre Germain, Joonhyun La, Angeliki Menegaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16026v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the kinetic wave equation, or phonon Boltzmann equation, set on the torus. Of particular interest is the presence of condensation in certain regimes. We describe entropy maximizers for fixed mass and energy. Our framework is very general, being valid in any dimension, for any dispersion relation, and even including the quantum kinetic wave equations. The framework is valid for any kind of system, and can be extended to include quantum systems as well as classical ones. We are interested in how the framework can be applied to quantum systems.

## 4. Ti and Spi, Carrollian extended boundaries at timelike and spatial   infinity

**Authors:** Jack Borthwick, Maël Chantreau, Yannick Herfray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we provide a definition for a notion of extended boundary at time and space-like infinity. This definition applies to asymptotically flat spacetime in the sense of Ashtekar--Romano and we wish to demonstrate, by example, its pertinence in a number of situations. Ti and Spi are both naturally equipped with (strong) Carrollian geometries which, under mild assumptions, enable to reduce the symmetry group down to the BMS group or to Poincar\'e in the flat case.

## 5. Spectral comparison results for Laplacians on discrete graphs

**Authors:** P. Bifulco, J. Kerner, C. Rose

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15937v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15937v1)

**Summary:**

In this note we derive such spectral comparison results in a rather general framework for general and possibly infinite discrete graphs. Along the way, we establish a discrete version of the local Weyl law whose proof does neither involve any Tauberian theorem nor the WeylLaw as used in the continuous case. We also establish a proof that does not involve the Tauberians or Weyl Laws. We conclude that the results are consistent with the theory of Schrodinger operators with discrete spectrum in Euclidean domains and quantum graphs.

## 6. Quantum particle in the wrong box (or: the perils of finite-dimensional   approximations)

**Authors:** Felix Fischer, Daniel Burgarth, Davide Lonigro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15889v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15889v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, they converge to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation generated by a specific Hamiltonian. The Friedrichs extension of the restriction of $H$ to the space of finite linear combinations of elements of the basis is discussed. As a practical demonstration of such results, we show that, for a wide class of bases (which include associated Legendre polynomials as a concrete example) the dynamics generated by the truncated Hamiltonians will always converge to one corresponding to the particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

## 7. Topological junctions for one-dimensional systems

**Authors:** David Gontier, Clément Tauber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15887v1)

**Summary:**

We study and classify the emergence of protected edge modes at the junction of one-dimensional materials. Using symmetries of Lagrangian planes in boundary symplectic spaces, we present a novel proof of the periodic table of topological insulators in one dimension. Our approach provides a systematic framework for understanding symmetry-protected modes in one-dimension. It does not rely on periodic nor ergodicity and covers a wide range of operators which includes both continuous and discrete models. We show that edge modes necessarily arise at the. junction of two materials having different topological indices.

## 8. Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic   Principle

**Authors:** G. Akemann, M. Duits, L. D. Molag

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15854v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15854v1)

**Summary:**

The two classical ensembles of random matrices enjoy an exact map to the ground state of noninteracting Fermions in a harmonic trap in one, respectively two dimensions. We investigate the variance of both smooth linear statistics and rough linear statistics (counting statistics) of random normal matrices. We show that for large matrix size $n$ the number variance is proportional to the circumference of $A$, and that for smooth test functions $f$ its variance interpolates between that of the GUE and Ginibre ensemble.

## 9. Parametric reflection maps: an algebraic approach

**Authors:** Anastasia Doikou, Marzia Mazzotta, Paola Stefanelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15839v1)

**Summary:**

We study solutions of the parametric set-theoretic reflection equation from an algebraic perspective. We use recently derived generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks, called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. The p-rack Yang-Baxter and reflection operators as well as the associated algebraic structures are defined setting up the frame for formulating the p- rack reflection algebra. The twist leads to considerably simplified constraints compared to the ones obtained from general set- theoretic reflections.

## 10. Dihedral beams

**Authors:** Alfonso Jaimes-Nájera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15566v1)

**Summary:**

Group theory-based formulation that introduces new classes of dihedral-symmetric beams is presented. Our framework leverages the algebraic properties of the dihedral group of rotations and reflections to transform input beams into closed-form families of Dihedral-invariant wavefields. Our approach can be applied to arbitrary scalar and vector input beams and constitutes a general group-theory formulation that can be extended beyond the Dihedral group. It is inspired by one of the outcomes of this work: elegant Hermite-Gauss beams can be described as a dihedral interference pattern of elegant traveling waves.

## 11. Blowing-up solutions of Klein-Gordon equations with gauge variant   semilinear terms in Friedmann-Lemaítre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes under   finite speed of propagation

**Authors:** Makoto Nakamura, Takuma Yoshizumi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15522v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15522v1)

**Summary:**

Blowing-up solutions of Klein-Gordon equations with gauge variant semilinear terms are considered in Friedmann-Lema\'itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Effects of spatial expansion or contraction on the solutions are studied through the scale-function and the curved mass. For example, the equations can be written as: Klein-Gordon equations with gauge variant Semilin terms as: Friedmann Lema itre Robertson Walker spacetimes 1.
