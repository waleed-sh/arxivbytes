## 0. KP integrability of non-perturbative differentials

**Authors:** Alexander Alexandrov, Boris Bychkov, Petr Dunin-Barkowski, Maxim Kazarian, Sergey Shadrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18592v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the KP integrability of non-perturbative topological recursion, which can be considered as a formal $\hbar$-deformation of the Krichever construction. This property goes back to a 2011 conjecture of Borot and Eynard. We also show the KP integrability of the KP constitution, which is a formal deformation of the Krichevers construction. We conclude that the KP-constitution is inexplicable in the topological recursion.

## 1. Weyl-Heisenberg covariant quantization for the discrete torus

**Authors:** Romain Murenzi, Aidan Zlotak, Jean Pierre Gazeau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18521v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18521v1)

**Summary:**

Covariant integral quantization is implemented for systems moving on the discrete periodic set $Z_d= \{0,1,\dotsc d-1$ mod$ d\}$. The symmetry group of this phase space is the periodic discrete version of the Weyl-Heisenberg group. The non-trivial unitary irreducible representation of this group, as acting on $L^2(Z_{N})$, is square integrable on the phase phase.

## 2. The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional   hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities

**Authors:** Naoto Shiraishi, Hal Tasaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18504v1)

**Summary:**

The model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension. The study was published in the Journal of Quantum Mechanics, published by the University of California, Los Angeles. For more information, visit the journal's website or go to http://www.qmm.org/.

## 3. A geometric description of some thermodynamical systems

**Authors:** Manuel de León, Jaime Bajo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18478v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18478v1)

**Summary:**

Almost cosymplectic structures are a natural framework to study thermodynamical systems. We are able to obtain the same evolution equations obtained previously by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. The proposed geometric description allows us to apply geometrical tools to discuss reduction by symmetries, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation or discretization of these systems. In this paper we show how this framework can be applied to the study of thermodynamic systems.

## 4. Global Bifurcation Curve for Fourth-Order MEMS/NEMS Models with Clamped   Boundary Conditions

**Authors:** Manting Lin, Hongjing Pan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18427v1)

**Summary:**

Global solution curve and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of fourth-order equations with doubly clamped boundary conditions are established. The results extend a theorem of P. Korman (2004) by allowing the presence of a singularity in the nonlinearity. The paper also provides a global a priori bound for $C^3$-norm ofpositive solutions, which is optimal in terms of regularity. Examples arising in MEMS/NEMS models are presented to illustrate applications of the main results.

## 5. Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube

**Authors:** Ce Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential. We show that the point-spectrum of the evolution operator of the model is completely independent of the magnetic potential, although the potential itself is dependent. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic possible. It might also suggest that the quantum walk can be stable in the presence of a strong magnetic field.

## 6. Wehrl inequalities for matrix coefficients of holomorphic discrete   series

**Authors:** Robin van Haastrecht, Genkai Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18382v1)

**Summary:**

We prove Wehrl-type inequalities for matrix coefficients of vector-valued holomorphic discrete series of $G$ for even integers $p=2n. The optimal constant is expressed in terms of Harish-Chandra formal degrees for the discrete series. We prove the maximizers are precisely the reproducing kernels. The maximizers can be written as $L^2(G)-L^{p}(G)$ for $G$, where $G' is the holomorphic series.

## 7. Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver   Gauge Theories

**Authors:** Pujun Liu, Rui-Dong Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359v1)

**Summary:**

We check the consistency of connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman black hole.

## 8. The Maximum Entropy Principle in Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics: A Brief   History and the Contributions of Wolfgang Dreyer

**Authors:** Takashi Arima, Tommaso Ruggeri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18340v1)

**Summary:**

We present a brief history of how the famous Maximum Entropy Principle was used as closure of moments of the Boltzmann equation. We want to remark on the important role of two fundamental papers by Wolfgang Dreyer, one in the classical framework and one in a relativistic context, to use this principle. We then compare the result with the macroscopic theory of Rational Extended Thermodynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for the theory of thermodynamics.

## 9. Cyclic $BV_\infty$ algebra and Frobenius manifold

**Authors:** Wen Hao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18325v1)

**Summary:**

We describe the construction of Frobenius manifold out of a cyclic (commutative) $BV_\infty$ algebra. Under the assumption of a Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration property and the existence of a compatible homotopy retract of $A$ onto its cohomology. We then apply it to Jacobi manifolds and Hermitian manifolds, generalizing known results in literature. The result is that the manifold is a Frobenii manifold.

## 10. Noether Symmetry Analysis for Generalized Brans-Dicke Cosmology

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18311v1)

**Summary:**

We present the complete solution to the classification problem regarding the variational symmetries of the generalized Brans-Dicke cosmological model. Through the symmetry analysis, we were able to specify the functional form of the field equations such that they become integrable. Additionally, new families of Integrable Cosmological models are presented. We present the results in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Astronomical Society of the UK (PRAS) on November 14, 2013.

## 11. Mechanics of curved crease origami: 1DoF mechanisms, distributed   actuation by spontaneous curvature, and cross-talk between multiple folds

**Authors:** Antonio DeSimone, Luciano Teresi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18265v1)

**Summary:**

Origami morphing is an exquisite art that has already received considerable attention in the mathematics and mechanics literature. Curved fold lines, leading to curved creases and curved pleated structures, introduce the additional complexity of mechanical coupling between the folds. This coupling can be exploited to obtain morphing structures with more robust folding pathways. We discuss one-degree-of-freedom mechanisms and folds actuated by spontaneous curvature (as in the case of hygromorphic multilayered composites)

## 12. Free the Design Space of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: High-Rank   Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces

**Authors:** Shihao Shao, Yikang Li, Zhouchen Lin, Qinghua Cui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v1)

**Summary:**

Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks. The design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The Python code is available in the appendix where the $n = 6, 0.5s, 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively, are obtained.

## 13. On a class of exact solutions of the Ishimori equation

**Authors:** Rustem N. Garifullin, Ismagil T. Habibullin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18195v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, a class of particular solutions of the Ishimori equation is found. This equation is known as the spatially two-dimensional version of the Heisenberg equation, which has important applications in the theory of ferromagnets. It is shown that the two- dimensional Toda-type lattice found earlier by Ferapontov, Shabat and Yamilov is a dressing chain for this equation. Using the integrable reductions of the dressing chain, the authors found an essentially new class of solutions.

## 14. Soliton Shielding of the focusing modified KdV equation

**Authors:** Ruihong Ma, Engui Fan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18175v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18175v1)

**Summary:**

We consider soliton gas solutions of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation. We first demonstrate that when the domain is a quadrature and the soliton density is an analytic function, the corresponding deterministicsoliton gas coincides with a finite number of solitons. We then show that the initial datum of this Cauchy problem is asymptotically step-like oscillatory, described by a periodic elliptic function.

## 15. Pseudo-potentials and local isometric immersion for a generalized   Camassa-Holm equation describing pseudospherical surfaces

**Authors:** Mingyue Guo, Zhenhua Shi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18128v1)

**Summary:**

A paper on the Camassa-Holm equation has been published. Using geometric methods, it is demonstrated that the equation is geometrically integrable. An infinite hierarchy of conservation laws is derived. The paper delves into the investigation of the problem of locally isometric immersion into three-dimensional Euclidean space based on the equation. It was published in the Journal of Mathematical Theory and Theory of Complex Phenomenon (JMTP) on November 14, 2013.

## 16. $N=1$ super Virasoro tensor categories

**Authors:** Thomas Creutzig, Robert McRae, Florencia Orosz Hunziker, Jinwei Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18127v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the category of $C_1$-cofinite modules for the universal $N=1$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra is locally finite. We show that this tensor category is semisimple, rigid, and slightly degenerate, and we determine its fusion rules. For central charge $c$ with $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times, we show that it is rigid and that its simple modules have the same fusion rules as the Rep category.

## 17. KPZ fixed point convergence of the ASEP and stochastic six-vertex models

**Authors:** Amol Aggarwal, Ivan Corwin, Milind Hegde

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18117v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18117v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the stochastic six-vertex (S6V) model and asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) under general initial conditions. We show under Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling of time, space, and fluctuations that the height functions of these models converge to the KPZ fixed point. Previously, our results were known in the case of ASEP (for a particular direction in the rarefaction fan) via a comparison approach arXiv:2008.06584.

## 18. Rational symmetric functions from the Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex model

**Authors:** Alexandr Garbali, Weiying Guo, Michael Wheeler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18085v1)

**Summary:**

In the Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex model in the quadrant, we introduce two families of rational multivariate functions $F_S$ and $G_S. These are in direct analogy with functions introduced by Borodin in the context of the higher-spin 6-Vertex model. We prove that $F S$ tends to a stable symmetric function denoted $H_S$. This leads to a simplified version of the Cauchy identity with a fully factorized kernel, and suggests self-duality of the functions.
