## 0. Essentials of the kinetic theory of multi-agent systems

**Authors:** Nadia Loy, Andrea Tosin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11554v1)

**Summary:**

Boltzmann-type kinetic equations have established themselves as a flexible and powerful paradigm to model interacting multi-agent systems. We consider, in particular, scalar equations implementing linear symmetric interaction rules. We develop the theory of well-posedness, trend to equilibrium, and Fokker-Planck asymptotics by relying extensively on Fourier methods. We also outline the basics of Monte Carlo algorithms for the numerical solution of such equations. Finally, we elaborate the theory further for Boltzman-type equations on graphs, a recent generalisation of the standard setting motivated by the modelling of networked multi- agent systems.

## 1. Effective Soliton Velocities in the Toda Lattice

**Authors:** Amol Aggarwal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we consider the Toda lattice at thermal equilibrium. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these solitons. We show that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation that approximately governs the dynamics of soliton locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the lattice's (random) Lax matrix.

## 2. On the localization length of finite-volume random block Schrödinger   operators

**Authors:** Steven Khang Truong, Fan Yang, Jun Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11382v1)

**Summary:**

We study a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs) in dimensions 1 and 2. RBSOs naturally extend the Anderson model by replacing the random potential with a random block potential. In dimension $d=2, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors. We also rigorously establish the Anderson localization-delocalization transition as $W^{-d/2}$ crosses the critical threshold $W -d /2.

## 3. Small distance behavior of one-particle Green's functions in electronic   structure theory

**Authors:** Heinz-Juergen Flad, Michael Griebel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11354v1)

**Summary:**

Researchers develop an analytical approach to determine the small distance behavior of Green's functions and related quantities in electronic structure theory. As a case study, we consider the one-particle Green's function up to 2nd order in the perturbation approach. We demonstrate the appearance of a logarithmic term in the corresponding 2 second order Feynman diagrams. Our asymptotic analysis leads to an improved classification scheme for the diagrams, which takes into account not only theperturbation order, but also the asymPTotic smoothness properties near their diagonals.

## 4. The Virasoro symmetries of the bigraded modified Toda hierarchy

**Authors:** Yi Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11303v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11303v1)

**Summary:**

Modified Toda hierarchy is a two- component generalization of KP hierarchy. We construct additional symmetries and derive the corresponding Adler-Shiota-van Moerbeke formula. We also show that $(N,M)$--bigraded modified Toda hierarchy (BMTH) is a special reduction for modified Toda. We conclude by showing that the B--Toda hierarchy possess additional symmetries that form a subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra.

## 5. Kähler-Einstein metrics arising from micro-canonical measures and   Hamiltonian dynamics

**Authors:** Robert J. Berman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11157v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce new probabilistic and variational constructions of (twisted) K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on complex projective algebraic varieties. The construction involves microcanonical measures associated with the level sets of the pluricomplex energy, which give rise to maximum entropy principles. These, in turn, yield novel characterizations of K \"ahler Einstein metrics and Fano varieties admitting such metrics. Also, connections to Hamiltonian dynamics are uncovered, resulting in a new evolution equation, that generalizes both the 2D incompressible Euler equation and 2D semi-geostrophic equation.
