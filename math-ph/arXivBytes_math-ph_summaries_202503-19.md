## 0. Strong local uniqueness for the vacant set of random interlacements

**Authors:** Subhajit Goswami, Pierre-François Rodriguez, Yuriy Shulzhenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14497v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14497v1)

**Summary:**

In the super-critical regime, there is a cluster of positive density inside any ball of radius $R$ with probability stretched exponentially close to $1$ in $R. With similar probability, any two large clusters are connected to each other locally in any configuration with strictly smaller intensity. This last property falls short of the classical local uniqueness, which requires a connection in the same configuration, i.e. in absence of any sprinkling. In this article we resolve this question by proving a stronger property, namely that local uniqueness holds simultaneously for all configurations with $v \le u$

## 1. Scalar Field Static Spherically Symmetric Solutions in Teleparallel   $F(T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Alexandre Landry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14465v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14465v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the static radial coordinate-dependent spherically symmetric spacetime in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity for a scalar field source. We compute new non-trivial telepar parallel $F('T') solutions by using a power-law coframe ansatz for each scalar potential case arising from the conservation laws. We apply this formula to find new exact $F'T' solutions for several cases of coframe Ansatz parameter. The new $F's will be relevant for {studying the models close to Born--Infeld and/or scalarized Black Hole (BH) solutions inside theDE)

## 2. Special solutions of a discrete Painlevé equation for quantum minimal   surfaces

**Authors:** Peter A. Clarkson, Anton Dzhamay, Andrew N. W. Hone, Ben Mitchell

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14436v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14436v1)

**Summary:**

We consider solutions of a discrete Painlev\'e equation arising from a construction of quantum minimal surfaces. While the discrete equation admits a continuum limit to the continuous Painlev’s I equation, we find that it has the same space of initial values as the continuous equation with certain specific parameter values. We show that some explicit special function solutions of Painlev's V yield the unique positive solution of the initial value problem required for quantum minimal surface. We further explicitly show how each iteration of this discrete equation corresponds to a certain composition of B\"acklund transformations for Painlev'es V.

## 3. Local formation of knotted screw dislocations in smectic liquid crystals

**Authors:** Robert Cardona, Andreu Vega

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14415v1)

**Summary:**

We show that a new screw dislocation loop can be introduced along any knot or link transverse to the regular layers through a purely local modification. We define a topological invariant of screw dislocated loops, the multiplicity, and show that it can be explicitly prescribed in our construction. Finally, we apply this method to establish that any link type can be locally introduced within the set of screw dislocations of a smectic configuration modeled by an open book decomposition. We conclude that the method can be applied to any configuration of a liquid crystal.

## 4. Recovering Parameters from Edge Fluctuations: Beta-Ensembles and   Critically-Spiked Models

**Authors:** Pierre Yves Gaudreau Lamarre

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14414v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14414v1)

**Summary:**

Let $Lambda$ be the point process that describes the edge scaling limit of either (i) "regular" beta-ensembles with inverse temperature $r_0$ or (ii) the top eigenvalues of Wishart or Gaussian invariant random matrices perturbed by critical spikes. We prove that a single observation of $Lamda$ suffices to recover (almost surely) either ($i) $beta$ in the case of beta-ensesmbles, or ($ii) $ r_0) in case of critically-spiked models.

## 5. Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity

**Authors:** Nikolaos Dimakis, Alex Giacomini, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Grigorios Panotopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.

## 6. Integral modelling and Reinforcement Learning control of 3D liquid metal   coating on a moving substrate

**Authors:** Fabio Pino, Edoardo Fracchia, Benoit Scheid, Miguel A. Mendez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14270v1)

**Summary:**

Controlling instabilities in the liquid film is crucial for achieving uniform and high-quality coatings. This study explores the possibility of controlling liquid films on a moving substrate using a combination of gas jets and electromagnetic actuators. The control strategy was developed within a reinforcement learning framework, where the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm interacted with the liquidFilm. The PPO found an optimal control law, which successfully reduced interface instabilities through a novel control mechanism, where gas jets push crests and electromagnets raise troughs using the Lorentz force.

## 7. Modeling Epidemics with Memory Effects: an Open Quantum System Approach

**Authors:** Fabio Bagarello, Francesco Gargano, Polina Khrennikova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14223v1)

**Summary:**

A new epidemic model has been developed to study the dynamics of an infectious disease in a population divided into compartments. The framework is based on open quantum systems and a Hilbert space formalism to model the spread of the infection. This approach allows for a mathematical framework that captures both Markovian and semi-Markovian dynamics in the evolution equations. Through numerical experiments, we examine the impact of varying memory parameters on the epidemic evolution, focusing in particular on the conditions under which the model remains physically admissible.

## 8. A von Neumann algebraic approach to Quantum Theory on curved spacetime

**Authors:** Louis E Labuschagne, W Adam Majewski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14107v1)

**Summary:**

We present the AQFT framework in terms of von Neumann algebras. This approach allows for a categorical description of AQFT as well as providing a natural and intrinsic framework for a description of entanglement. Killing local flows may be lifted to the algebraic setting in curved space-time. We show that quasi-free representations of Weyl algebra fit the presented framework perfectly. Finally, the problem of enlarging the set of observables is discussed. We point out the usefulness of Orlicz space techniques to encompass unbounded field operators.

## 9. On the magnetic Dirichlet to Neumann operator on the exterior of the   disk -- diamagnetism, weak-magnetic field limit and flux effects

**Authors:** Helffer Bernard, Nicoleau Francois

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14008v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14008v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we analyze the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. We show that the strong diamagnetism property holds. We study the ground state energy of the D- to-N map. Finally, we slightly extend to the exterior case the asymptotic results obtained in the interior case for general domains. We conclude that the magnetic potential $A_\nu (x,y)$ is the Aharonov-Bohm potential centered at the origin of flux $2\pi $

## 10. Existence and Regularizing Effects of a Nonlinear Diffusion Model for   Plasma Instabilities

**Authors:** William Porteous, Irene M. Gamba, Kun Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13922v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13922v1)

**Summary:**

We study existence and regularity of weak solutions to a nonlinear parabolic Dirichlet problem. The Benilan-Crandall inequality, derived from time-scaling arguments, is of independent interest for exposing a regularizing effect of the parabolic u$\Delta$u operator. This problem originates in the theory of nonlinear instability damping via wave-particle interactions in plasma physics. We identify special solutions which saturate these bounds. We find weak solutions from $L^p\ (p < \infty)$ initial data.

## 11. Local well-posedness for Chern-Simons gauged $O(3)$ sigma equations   under the Lorenz gauge

**Authors:** Jin Guanghui, Huali Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13871v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for the Chern-Simons gauged $O(3)$ sigma model under the Lorenz gauge condition. We prove the local well-posedness of solutions if the initial matter field and gauge field satisfy $s_c=1$. Our proof is based on identifying null forms within the system and utilizing bilinear estimates in wave-Sobolev space. We conclude that the critical regularity for $s-c$ is $s=1$
