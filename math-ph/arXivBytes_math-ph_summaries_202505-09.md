## 0. Marsden--Meyer--Weinstein reduction for $k$-contact field theories

**Authors:** J. de Lucas, X. Rivas, S. Vilarino, B. M. Zawora

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05462v1)

**Summary:**

This work devises a Marsden--Meyer--Weinstein $k$-contact reduction. Our techniques are illustrated with several examples of mathematical and physical relevance. As a byproduct, we review the previous contact reduction literature so as to clarify and to solve some inaccuracies. We conclude with an overview of the current state of the art in the field of Marsden-Meyers-Weinstein contact reduction. We also discuss some of the limitations of the previous work.

## 1. RL-DAUNCE: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Data Assimilation with   Uncertainty-Aware Constrained Ensembles

**Authors:** Pouria Behnoudfar, Nan Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05452v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05452v1)

**Summary:**

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework. RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process. It is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. It outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation ofphysical constraints.

## 2. Characterisation of Markov property on planar maps

**Authors:** Pablo Araya, Luis Fredes, Avelio Sepúlveda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05447v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit, in a self contained way, the Markov property on planar maps and decoratedPlanar maps. First, we characterize the laws on these planarMaps that satisfy both theMarkov property and rerooting invariance. Second, we provide a comprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps. Third, we introduce decorated metric planar Maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length intervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on the edges.

## 3. The effective energy of a lattice metamaterial

**Authors:** Xuenan Li, Robert V. Kohn

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05436v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05436v1)

**Summary:**

We study the sense in which the continuum limit of a broad class of discrete materials with periodic structures can be viewed as a nonlinear elastic material. A key motivation for this work is its relevance to mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials. Such systems often have soft modes'', achieved in typical examples by modulating mechanisms. Our results permit the following more general definition of a soft mode: it is a macroscopic deformation whose effective energy vanishes in a continuum limit. We discuss how the degeneracy that plagues prior work in this area can be avoided by penalizing change of orientation.

## 4. A new time-dependent quantum theory based on Tsallis' distribution

**Authors:** Won Sang Chung, Georg Junker, Luis M. Nieto, Hassan Hassanabadi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05419v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, inspired by Tsallis' probability distribution based on a $q$-deformed Boltzmann factor, we stipulate a new $ q$-Deformed quantum dynamics. We obtain a new time-dependent $q#-deform Schr\"odinger equation. The free time-evolution of a Gaussian wave packet and that induced by an harmonic interaction are studied within this $q*-deformation quantum mechanical framework. The paper is published in the online edition of the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 5. On an inverse problem in photoacoustic

**Authors:** M. I. Belishev, D. Langemann, A. S. Mikhaylov, V. S. Mikhaylov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05146v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05146v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the problem of reconstruction of the Cauchy data for the wave equation in $R$ and $R2$ by the measurements of its solution on the boundary of the unit ball. We also consider the reconstruction of  the wave equation for $R' and 'R' by the measurements of its solution on the  boundary of the unit ball. For example, we consider the problem of reconstructing the wave equation for $R' and $R 'R2' by measuring its solution on the boundary of the unit ball.

## 6. Inverse problem for one-dimensional dynamical Dirac system (BC-method)

**Authors:** Mikhail Belishev, Victor Mikhailov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05140v1)

**Summary:**

A forward problem for the Dirac system is to find $u=0$ for $x>0,\,t>0$. An inverse problem is to recover $p,q$ for an (arbitrary) fixed $T>0. In itself the system is not controllable: the local completeness of states does not hold, but its relevant extension gains controllability. It is the fact, which enables one to apply the boundary control method for solving the inverse problem. The procedure that determines $p,.q$ is proposed and the characteristic solvability conditions on $r$ are provided.

## 7. In memoriam: aspects of Santosh Kumar's work on exact results in RMT

**Authors:** Peter J. Forrester

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04943v1)

**Summary:**

Santosh Kumar was an active researcher on the topic of exact results in random matrix theory and their various applications. Barely entering his mid-career, he died unexpectedly on the 18th October 2024. The present article gives an account of some of his research directions and findings. As well as serving as a tribute to his work, this is done also for the purpose of providing a resource for those who may continue along related lines in the future.
