## 0. Skyrmion stacking in stray field-coupled ultrathin ferromagnetic   multilayers

**Authors:** N. J. Dubicki, V. V. Slastikov, A. Bernand-Mantel, C. B. Muratov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14649v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14649v1)

**Summary:**

This paper explores the energy landscape of ferromagnetic multilayer   heterostructures that feature magnetic skyrmions in each magnetic layer. The presence of stacked skyrMions in the   adjacent layers gives rise to a strongly coupled nonlinear system. The induced magnetic field plays a crucial stabilizing   role. Such   magnetic heterostructure have been pursued as possible hosts of room temperature stable magnetic skYRmions suitable for the next generation of low power information technologies.

## 1. On the Mathematical Theory of Quantum Stochastic Filtering Equations for   Mixed States

**Authors:** Vassili N Kolokoltsov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14605v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum filtering equations for mixed states were developed in 80th of the last century. Since then the problem of building a rigorous mathematical theory for these equations has been a challenging open mathematical problem. In a previous paper, the author developed the theory of these equations in the case of bounded coupling operators, including a new version that arises as the law of large numbers for interacting particles under continuous observation. In this paper the main body of these results is extended to the basic cases of unbounded coupling operators.

## 2. Dispersive Decay Estimates for periodic Jacobi operators on the   half-line

**Authors:** Amir Sagiv, Remy Kassem, Michael I Weinstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14498v1)

**Summary:**

We establish dispersive time-decay estimates for periodic Jacobi operators on the discrete half-line, $\N$. We prove $t^{-1/2}$ decay in the weighted $\ell^\infty_{-1}$ norm for all such operators. For any even period $q\geq2$, if the continuous spectrum consists of exactly $q$ disjoint intervals (bands), we obtain a $t^1/(q+1)$ decay rate without any further assumptions.

## 3. Optimal dispersion for discrete periodic Schrödinger operators

**Authors:** David Damanik, Jake Fillman, Giorgio Young

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14475v1)

**Summary:**

We prove a dispersive estimate for periodic discrete Schr\"odinger operators on the line with optimal rate of decay. By standard methods, we deduce dispersive estimates for the discrete nonlinear Schr\'odinger equation with small initial data and suitable nonlinearity when the underlying Hamiltonian is periodic. We also show how to solve the equation for a non-periodic Hamiltonian. We conclude by showing that the equation can be solved for a periodic Hamiltonian with a suitable rate of decay.

## 4. Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary

**Authors:** Griffen Adams, Ovidiu Costin, Gerald V. Dunne, Sergei Gukov, Oğuz Öner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441v1)

**Summary:**

We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory. We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory.

## 5. A Garden of Eden theorem for Smale spaces

**Authors:** Tullio Ceccherini-Silberstein, Michel Coornaert

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14409v1)

**Summary:**

Dynamical system is surjunctive if every injective endomorphism of $X$ is surjective. A dynamical system satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem if it has both the Moore and the Myhill properties. We prove that every irreducible Smale space satisfies the Eden theorem and that every non-wandering Smalespace is sur junctive and has the Moore property. We also prove that a dynamical space is pre-injective if its restriction to each $f$-homoclinicity class of $ X$ is injective.

## 6. Linearized renormalization

**Authors:** L. L. Salcedo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14152v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14152v1)

**Summary:**

Using an infinitesimal approach, this work addresses the renormalization problem to deal with the ultraviolet divergences arising in quantum field theory. Under the assumption that the action has already been renormalized to yield an ultraviolet-finite effective action, we analyze how the action must be adjusted. The analysis then provides the change that is induced on the correlation functions of the theory. This program is successfully carried out in the case of super-renormalizable theories, namely, a scalar field with cubic interaction in four space-time dimensions and with quartic interaction in three space- time dimensions.

## 7. An Ode to the Penrose and Witten transforms in Twistor space for 3D CFT

**Authors:** Aswini Bala, Dhruva K. S

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14082v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the construction of Sp$(4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant objects in the twistor space for three dimensional conformal field theories. We show that this feature can be traced to the Penrose and Witten transforms of these operators that we derive. Similar to the non supersymmetric case, we find an important role played by the (super) infinity twistor which we exemplify through parity odd super-correlators and a supers asymmetric contact term.

## 8. The Relative Fermionic Entropy in Two-Dimensional Rindler Spacetime

**Authors:** Felix Finster und Albert Much

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14076v1)

**Summary:**

The fermionic relative entropy in two-dimensional Rindler spacetime is studied using both modular theory and the reduced one-particle density operators. The methods and results are compared. A formula for the relative entropy for general Gaussian states is derived. The results are published in the book "Fermionic Relentless Entanglement in Two-Dimensional Spacetime" published by the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2010. The book is based on the work of David Hoyle and Peter Hoyle, published by Elsevier.

## 9. A novel variant of rhombic Penrose tiling

**Authors:** Nobuhisa Fujita, Komajiro Niizeki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14013v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14013v1)

**Summary:**

A novel variant of a planar quasiperiodic tiling with tenfold symmetry. It employs the same thick and thin rhombuses as the celebrated rhombic Penrose tiling. This tiling exhibits a high density of a compact decagonal motif forming a two-tiered, five-petaled flower pattern. We identify a slightly enhanced degree of hyperuniform order compared to the standard rhombo-rhombo tiling and an inflation/deflation symmetry associated with the golden mean.

## 10. On the existence of noncommutative Levi-Civita connections in derivation   based calculi

**Authors:** Joakim Arnlind, Victor Hildebrandsson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13984v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13984v1)

**Summary:**

We study the existence of Levi-Civita connections, i.e torsion free connections compatible with a hermitian form. The theory is illustrated with explicit computations for free modules of rank three, including noncommutative 3-tori. We note that our approach is algebraic and does not rely on analytic tools such as $C^\ast$-algebra norms. We identify a necessary symmetry condition that extends the classical notion of metric symmetry in Riemannian geometry.

## 11. Remarks on orthogonality spaces

**Authors:** John Harding, Remi Salinas Schemes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13871v1)

**Summary:**

We show that every finite graph occurs as an induced subgraph of the orthogonality space of a finite orthomodular lattice. We provide two results. The first is a companion result to the result of Tau and Tserunyan \cite{Tau} that every countable graph occurs in a Hilbert space. The second is a result that shows that a finite graph constructed from consideration of mutually unbiased bases occurs as a subgraph in a different way from a countable one.

## 12. Nonlinear Lie-Hamilton systems: $t$-Dependent curved oscillators and   Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians

**Authors:** Rutwig Campoamor-Stursberg, Francisco J. Herranz, Javier de Lucas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13853v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13853v1)

**Summary:**

Nonlinear Lie-Hamilton systems are no longer related to a linear $t$-dependent combination of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of functions. This novel formalism is accomplished through a detailed analysis of related structures, such as momentum maps and generalized distributions. The new notions and tools are illustrated with the study of the harmonic oscillator, H\'enon-Heiles systems and Painlev\'e trascendents within a $t $-dependent framework. In addition, the formalist is carefully applied to construct oscillators and Kepler-Coulomb systems on the sphere, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces.

## 13. Smooth Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equation

**Authors:** James Glimm, Jarret Petrillo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13816v1)

**Summary:**

Smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation with smooth but otherwise unconstrained initial conditions are constructed to solve the Millennium fluids problem in the positive. The construction occurs in a finite periodic cube. The smooth solutions are the mean values of general weak solutions and are alternately characterized as the entropy production minimizing solutions. They are also known as the "smooth solutions" of the "Navier- Stokes equation" or the "Smooth equations" of Navier and Stokes.

## 14. Colored Vertex Models and Interacting Reverse Plane Partitions

**Authors:** Jonah Guse, David Jiang, David Keating

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13806v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13806v1)

**Summary:**

We study the coupling of pairs of reverse plane partitions of the same shape by assigning a certain local interaction. We show that they are in bijection with a certain Yang-Baxter integrable colored vertex model. We also give a bijection between the coupled pairs ofreverse plane partitions with the interaction strength set to zero and a single reverse plane partition of thesame shape. We are able to compute the generating function for the interacting pairs of reversing plane partitions. We conclude by showing that this bijection can be used to predict the shape of a given object.

## 15. Anomaly-free twistorial higher-spin theories

**Authors:** Tung Tran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13785v1)

**Summary:**

We present twistor BV actions that encompasses many classically consistent bosonic holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories with vanishing cosmological constant. Upon quantization, these actions are shown to be quantum consistent, i.e. no gauge anomaly. Anomaly-free twistorial theories can be identified through an index theorem, which is an extension of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch index theorem. We also discuss the anomaly cancellation mechanisms on twistor space to render anomalous theories quantum consistent at one loop.
