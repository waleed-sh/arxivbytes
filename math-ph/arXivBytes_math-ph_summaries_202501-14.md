## 0. The BCFW tiling of the ABJM Amplituhedron

**Authors:** Michael Oren Perlstein, Ran Tessler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07576v1)

**Summary:**

The orthogonal momentum amplituhedron O_k was introduced in 2021 by Huang, Kojima, Wen, and Zhang in the study of scattering amplitudes of ABJM theory. It was conjectured that it admits a decomposition into BCFW cells. We prove this conjecture. It is a black hole in the ABJM system. It can be used to study the scattering amplitude of AB JM theory. For more information, see ABJM Theory and ABJM Black Hole Theory.

## 1. On the solution of the harmonic-divgrad PDEs system

**Authors:** Federico Manzoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07506v1)

**Summary:**

We study a particular system of partial differential equations in which the harmonic, the divergence and the gradient operators of the unknown functions appear. Using the Killing Hopf theorem and leveraging the properties of Riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvature we establish the conditions under which these equations admit only the trivial solutions. The analysis of this particular system is motivated by its occurrence in the study of asymptotic symmetries in $p$-form gauge theories and in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories.

## 2. Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum   state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase

**Authors:** Benedikt M. Reible, Ana Djurdjevac, Luigi Delle Site

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07492v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating a dilute gas of vibrating particles and a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system.

## 3. On the Time-decay of solutions arising from periodically forced Dirac   Hamiltonians

**Authors:** Joseph Kraisler, Amir Sagiv, Michael I. Weinstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07466v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07466v1)

**Summary:**

There is increased interest in time-dependent (non-autonomous) Hamiltonians, stemming in part from the active field of Floquet quantum materials. Despite this, dispersive time-decay bounds, which reflect energy transport in such systems, have received little attention. We show that this is not necessarily the case if $\nu(t)$ is not spatially localized. In a rotating mass model, the dispersive decay bound is of the same type as for the constant mass model. But in a model with a periodically alternating sign of the mass, the results are quite different.

## 4. On characteristic classes of vector bundles over quantum spheres

**Authors:** Francesco D'Andrea, Giovanni Landi, Chiara Pagani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07448v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quantization of spaces whose K-theory in the classical limit is the ring of dual numbers. For a compact quantum space, we give sufficient conditions that guarantee there is a morphism of abelian groups compatible with the tensor product of bimodules. We give explicit formulas for the projections of vector bundles on $S^4_q$ associated to the principal $SU_q(2)$-bundle. Applications include the standard Podle\'s sphere and a quantum $4$-sphere coming from quantum symplectic groups.

## 5. Boundary deformation techniques for Neumann problems for the Helmholtz   equation

**Authors:** Manuel Cañizares

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07411v1)

**Summary:**

We adapt boundary deformation techniques to solve a Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation with rough electric potentials in bounded domains. This work is motivated by a Runge approximation result in the context of an inverse problem in point-source scattering with partial data. We illustrate how to find a domain in which the Neumann Problem can be solved for any energy, if there is some freedom in the choice of the domain. We study the dependance of Neumann eigenvalues of the perturbed Laplacian with respect to boundaryDeformation.

## 6. Instantons with continuous conformal symmetries: Hyperbolic and singular   monopoles and more, oh my!

**Authors:** C. J. Lang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07406v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we comprehensively study instantons with every kind of continuous conformal symmetry. Examples of these objects are hard to come by due to non-linear constraints. By applying previous work on moduli spaces, we introduce a linear constraint, whose solution greatly simplifies these non- linear constraints. We also prove that the basic instanton is essentially the only instanton with two particular kinds of conformal symmetries. We discuss the connections between instantons and other gauge-theoretic objects: hyperbolic and singular monopoles.

## 7. Momentum coupling of classical atoms

**Authors:** Andras Suto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07369v1)

**Summary:**

A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. We then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.

## 8. A unified framework for graviton, "partially massless" graviton, and   photon fields in de Sitter spacetime under conformal symmetry

**Authors:** Jean-Pierre Gazeau, Hamed Pejhan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07367v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a conformally invariant (CI) framework in de Sitter (dS) spacetime. This unifies the descriptions of graviton, ``partially massless'' graviton and photon fields. This unification enhances the understanding of fundamental aspects of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds. The framework is grounded in a rigorous group-theoretical analysis in the Wigner sense. It employs Dirac's six-cone formalism and the concept of conformal space. It is based on the field equations for spinor and vector fields in Minkowski spacetime in a manifestly CI form.

## 9. Novel possible symmetries of $S$-matrix generated by   $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie superalgebras

**Authors:** Ren Ito, Akio Nago

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07311v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we explore the $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie (super)algebras as novel possible generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix. They are natural extensions of Coleman-Mandula theorem and Haag-Lopszanski-Sohnius theorem, which are the no-go theorems for generators of asymmetries. As the results, we demonstrate that a $S#-graded extension of the supersymmetric algebra can be a symmetry.

## 10. Free energy of spherical Coulomb gases with point charges

**Authors:** Sung-Soo Byun, Nam-Gyu Kang, Seong-Mi Seo, Meng Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07284v1)

**Summary:**

We consider two-dimensional Coulomb gases on the Riemann sphere with determinantal or Pfaffian structures, under external potentials that are invariant under rotations around the axis connecting the north and south poles. We derive precise asymptotic expansions of the free energies, including the constant terms. These models can be interpreted as Coulombgas on the complex plane with weakly confining potentials, where the associated droplet is the entire complex plane. For these models, we derive preciseAsymptosis expansions.

## 11. Additive realizations of asymptotically additive set maps

**Authors:** Raimundo Briceño, Godofredo Iommi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07282v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the conditions under which a set map into a Banach space can be realized as the ergodic sum of a vector under a group representation. We show that for uniformly bounded group representations, this property is characterized by the class of bounded asymptotically additive set maps. As an application, our results generalize key aspects of thermodynamic formalism, bridging the gap between additive and non-additive frameworks. We develop a relative version of this characterization, identifying Conditions under which the additive realization can be chosen within a specified target set.

## 12. Asymptotics of the Humbert functions $Ψ_1$ and $Ψ_2$

**Authors:** Peng-Cheng Hang, Malte Henkel, Min-Jie Luo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07281v1)

**Summary:**

A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions and the Appell function is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymPTotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.

## 13. Segal-Bargmann transforms and generalized Weyl algebras associated with   the~Meixner class of orthogonal polynomials

**Authors:** Chadaphorn Kodsueb, Eugene Lytvynov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07241v1)

**Summary:**

Meixner~(1934) proved that there exist exactly five classes of orthogonal Sheffer sequences. The Segal--Bargmann transform provides a unitary isomorphism between the $L^2$-space of the Gaussian distribution and the Fock space of entire functions. To derive our results, we use normal ordering in generalized Weyl algebras that are naturally associated with the orthoshef sequences. We also extend the construction to the case of the Poisson distribution.

## 14. Limiting absorption principle of Helmholtz equation with sign changing   coefficients under periodic structure

**Authors:** Wenjing Zhang, Yu Chen, Yixian Gao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07229v1)

**Summary:**

Negative refractive index materials have garnered widespread attention due to their anomalous electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we utilize complementing boundary conditions to conduct a priori estimates for Cauchy problems and derive the limiting absorption principle. We establish the well-posedness of the transmission problem involving conventional materials and negative refractiveIndex materials within a simulated two-dimensional periodic structure. The paper is published in the Journal of Applied Physics and is open-source and free to read on the Internet.

## 15. Mass (re)distribution for quantum dust cores of black holes

**Authors:** L. Gallerani, A. Mentrelli, A. Giusti, R. Casadio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07219v1)

**Summary:**

The collective ground state for a spherical symmetric dust ball has been investigated recently in [R. Casadio, Phys. Lett. B 843 (2023) 138055]. In this study, we refine that model by obtaining a mass distribution that accounts for the superposition of wavefunctions across different layers. The new nearly parabolic distribution replaces the linear mass profile of the original work, featuring an overall downward concavity, which leads to a non-vanishing tension.

## 16. Dualities in random matrix theory

**Authors:** Peter J. Forrester

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07144v1)

**Summary:**

Duality identities in random matrix theory for products and powers of characteristic polynomials, and for moments, are reviewed. Such dualities involve (the generalised) classical Gaussian, Laguerre and Jacobi ensembles Hermitian ensembled, or the circular Jacobi ensemble. The main tool to study dualities for moments of the spectral density, and generalisations, is the loop equations. Applications to the computation of the scaling limit of various $\beta$ ensemble correlation and distribution functions are also reviewed.

## 17. Exact density profile in a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise

**Authors:** Taiki Ishiyama, Fujimoto Kazuya, Tomohiro Sasamoto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07095v1)

**Summary:**

We theoretically investigate the many-body dynamics of a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on the infinite interval. We obtain the exact solution of an average particle-density profile for the domain wall and the alternating initial conditions via the Bethe ansatz. We demonstrate that the asymptotic forms approach those of the symmetric simple exclusion process, identifying corrections from it. We show that the diffusive transport always emerges in the long time dynamics if the strength of the dephase, no matter how small, is positive.

## 18. The exact convex roof for GHZ-W mixtures for three qubits and beyond

**Authors:** Andreas Osterloh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07084v1)

**Summary:**

I present an exact solution for the convex roof of the square root threetangle for all states within the Bloch sphere. The working hypothesis is that optimal decompositions contain as many states from the zero-polytope as possible. The footprint of the measure of entanglement consists in a characteristic pattern for the fixed pure states on the surface which form the optimal solution. The solution is subject to transformation properties due to the SL-invariance of theEntanglement measure.
