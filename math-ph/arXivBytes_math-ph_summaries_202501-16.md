## 0. Calculus with combinatorial differential forms for fluid flow analysis   in porous and fractured media

**Authors:** Changhao Liu, Kiprian Berbatov, Majid Sedighi, Andrey P. Jivkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08996v1)

**Summary:**

The fabric of porous and fractured media contains solid regions (grains) and voids. The space conducting fluids is a system of connected voids with variable geometries. We propose a flexible method for modelling such media by mapping their measured fabric's characteristics onto polyhedral tessellations of space. The map assigns voluminous voids and grains to polyhedrons (3D), narrow expansive voids to some polyhedral faces (2D), and thin long voids for 1D. The analysis of transport through such discrete structures with components of different dimensions is performed by a novel mathematical method.

## 1. Topological Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconducting quantum   rings

**Authors:** Elena Landro', Vladimir M. Fomin, Alessio Zaccone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08986v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08986v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum rings have emerged as a playground for quantum mechanics and topological physics. Experimentally realizable quantum rings, albeit at the scale of a few nanometers, are 3D nanostructures. Surprisingly, no theories exist for the topology of the Fermi sea of quantum rings and a microscopic theory of superconductivity in nanorings is also missing. In this paper, we remedy this situation by developing a mathematical model for theTopology of The FermI sea.

## 2. Continuous Approach to Phase (Norm) Retrieval Frames

**Authors:** Ramin Farshchian, Rajab Ali Kamyabi-Gol, Fahimeh Arabyani-Neyshaburi, Fatemeh Esmaeelzadeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08927v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the properties of continuous frames, with a particular focus on phase retrieval and norm retrieval in the context of Hilbert spaces. We introduce the concept of continuous near-Riesz bases and prove their invariance under invertible operators. We study the stability of phase retrieval under perturbations. Furthermore, tensor product frames for separable Hilbert spaces are studied, and we establish the equivalence of phase retrieved and norm retrieved properties between components and their tensor products..

## 3. On the Lyapunov exponent for the random field Ising transfer matrix, in   the critical case

**Authors:** Orphée Collin, Giambattista Giacomin, Rafael L. Greenblatt, Yueyun Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08797v1)

**Summary:**

We study the top Lyapunov exponent of a product of random $2 \times 2$ matrices. We build a probability that is close to the Furstenberg probability. We then show that sharp estimates on the ladder times (renewal) process lead to a sharp control on the probability measure we build and, in turn, to the control of its distance from the FurStenberg probability, in terms of ladder times of a centered random walk which is directly related to the random matrix sequence.

## 4. Integrable deformations of principal chiral model from solutions of   associative Yang-Baxter equation

**Authors:** D. Domanevsky, A. Levin, M. Olshanetsky, A. Zotov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08777v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08777v1)

**Summary:**

We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to the Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models. Using the coefficients of the expansion we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair.

## 5. The Global Sections of Chiral de Rham Complexes on Closed Complex Curves

**Authors:** Bailin Song, Wujie Xie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08743v1)

**Summary:**

The space of global sections of the chiral de Rham complex on any closed complex curve with genus $g \ge2$ is calculated. The space of sections on a chiral complex on a closed complex curves is also calculated. For example, the space of segments on a complex curve on which the complex is chiral is calculated is $g\ge2' and $g' is the genus of the complex.

## 6. Transport theory in moderately anisotropic plasmas: I, Collisionless   aspects of axisymmetric velocity space

**Authors:** Yanpeng Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08634v1)

**Summary:**

A novel transport theory, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, is presented for scenarios when velocity space exhibits axisymmetry. In this theory, the transport equations are derived from the 1D-2V Vlasov equation, employing the Spherical harmonics expansions (SHE) and King function expansion (KFE) in velocity space. It is a nature process to present the closure relations of transport equations based on SHE and KFE, successfully providing a kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM)

## 7. Delocalization of a general class of random block Schrödinger   operators

**Authors:** Fan Yang, Jun Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608v1)

**Summary:**

 random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSO) feature a random block potential. We focus on three specific RBSOs: the block Anderson model, the Anderson orbital model and the Wegner orbital model. We prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for the bulk eigenvectors, as well as a quantum diffusion estimate for the Green's function. We anticipate that our techniques can be adapted to real or non-Gaussian block potentials and more general interactions.
