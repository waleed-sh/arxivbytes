## 0. Hamiltonian Simulation via Stochastic Zassenhaus Expansions

**Authors:** Joseph Peetz, Prineha Narang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13922v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13922v1)

**Summary:**

Stochastic Zassenhaus expansions (SZEs) are ancilla-free quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation. SZEs map nested ZASSenhaus formulas onto quantum gates and then employ randomized sampling to minimize circuit depths. For a 10-qubit transverse-field Ising model, we construct an 11th- order SZE with 42x fewer CNOTs than the standard 10th-order product formula. We empirically demonstrate regimes where SZE's reduce simulation errors by many orders of magnitude compared to leading algorithms.

## 1. Scalar field source Teleparallel Robertson-Walker F(T)-gravity solutions

**Authors:** Alexandre Landry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13895v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a scalar field source. The new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications in dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy and quintom models of physical processes. For $k=0$, we find an easy-to-compute $F (T) $ solution formula applicable for any scalarField source. We obtain, for $k=-1$ and $+1$ situations, some new analytical $F('T') solutions, only for specific $n$-parameter values.

## 2. Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters

**Authors:** Tommaso Grigoletto, Clément Pellegrini, Francesco Ticozzi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum stochastic models are widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.

## 3. Rademacher expansion of modular integrals

**Authors:** Marco Maria Baccianti, Jeevan Chandra, Lorenz Eberhardt, Thomas Hartman, Sebastian Mizera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13827v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13827v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a method to evaluate integrals of non-holomorphic modular functions over the fundamental domain of the torus. It proceeds in two steps: first the integral is transformed to a Lorentzian contour, and then we apply a two-dimensional version of the Rademacher expansion. We apply this technique to a variety of examples such as the evaluation of string one-loop partition functions, where it leads to the first analytic formula for the cosmological constants of the bosonic string.

## 4. Infinitesimal Star Products Compatible with Coisotropic Reduction

**Authors:** Marvin Dippell

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13792v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13792v1)

**Summary:**

We determine infinitesimal star products on Poisson manifolds compatible with coisotropic reduction. This is achieved by computing the second constraint Hochschild cohomology of the constraint algebra of functions associated to any submanifold equipped with a simple distribution. We conclude that the star products of Poisson manifolds are in inclusive in terms of coisotropic reduction on the Poisson Manifold. We  conclude that the star products are included in the constitution of the Poisson manifold.

## 5. Large Deviations in Switching Diffusion: from Free Cumulants to   Dynamical Transitions

**Authors:** Mathis Guéneau, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13754v1)

**Summary:**

We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle at any finite time $t$ We uncover rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.

## 6. Naked and truly naked rotating black holes

**Authors:** H. V. Ovcharenko, O. B. Zaslavskii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13719v1)

**Summary:**

In some space-times with Killing horizons some curvature components, responsible for tidal forces, become enhanced from the viewpoint of a falling observer. This leads to the notion of so-called naked black holes. Previous results included static spherically symmetric or distorted static metrics. In the present work, we generalized them to include rotation in consideration. We also scrutiny how the algebraic type can change in the vicinity of the horizon due to local Lorentz boost. We analyze the behavior of Weyl scalar for different kinds of observers.

## 7. Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian   extensions of the XY model

**Authors:** D. C. Liu, Murray T. Batchelor

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13654v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution.

## 8. v-representability and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for non-interacting   Schrödinger operators with distributional potentials in the one-dimensional   torus

**Authors:** Thiago Carvalho Corso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13513v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13513v1)

**Summary:**

Ground-state density of any non-interacting Schr\"odinger operator on the one-dimensional torus with potentials in a certain class of distributions is strictly positive. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem holds, i.e., the external potential is uniquely determined by the ground- state density. In particular, the density-to-potential Kohn-Sham map is single-valued, and the non-Interacting Lieb functional is differentiable at every point in this space of $v$-representable densities.

## 9. Grover algorithm and absolute zeta functions

**Authors:** Jirô Akahori, Kazuki Horita, Norio Konno, Rikuki Okamoto, Iwao Sato, Yuma Tamura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13393v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13393v1)

**Summary:**

The Grover algorithm is one of the most famous quantum algorithms. The absolute zeta function can be regarded as a zetafunction over $\mathbb{F}_{1}$ defined by a function satisfying the absolute automorphy. In this study, we show the property of theGrover algorithm and present a relation between the Grovergorithm and the absoluteZeta function. We focus on the period because if the period is finite, then we are able to get an absolute Zeta function explicitly by Kurokawa's theorem.

## 10. Linear extrapolation for the graph of function of single variable based   on walks

**Authors:** Norio Konno, Shohei Koyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13386v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum walk was introduced as a quantum counterpart of the random walk and has been intensively studied since around 2000. Its applications include topological insulators, radioactive waste reduction, and quantum search. The first author in 2019 defined a time-series model based on the measure of the quantum walk in one dimension. Inspired by his model, this paper proposes a new model for the graph of a function of a single variable determined by the measure which comes from the weak limit measure of a quantum walk.

## 11. Physics on manifolds with exotic differential structures

**Authors:** Ulrich Chiapi-Ngamako, M. B. Paranjape

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13328v1)

**Summary:**

The 7-sphere was the first, celebrated example, found by Milnor, of a topological manifold that can be endowed with a finite number, 28, of inequivalent differential structures. Physically this means that what is meant by a differentiable function (smooth) is simply different for observers. We find that the spectra of these operators are dependent on the choice of differential structure and hence the identical topological manifolds have different physical laws. We examine the import of inequival differential structures on the physics of fields obeying the Dirac equation.

## 12. RTT presentation of coideal subalgebra of quantized enveloping algebra   of type CI

**Authors:** Yingwen Zhang, Hongda Lin, Honglian Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13305v1)

**Summary:**

The pair consisting of a quantum group and its corresponding coideal subalgebra, known as a quantum symmetric pair, was developed independently by M. Noumi and G. Letzter through different approaches. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, for symmetric pairs $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, we construct a coidal sub algebra of the quantized enveloping algebra of type CI using the $R$-matrix presentation. Second, we derive a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt(PBW) basis for $U-q-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-
