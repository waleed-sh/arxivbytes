## 0. A note on spontaneous symmetry breaking in the mean-field Bose gas

**Authors:** Andreas Deuchert, Phan Thanh Nam, Marcin Napiorkowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19402v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at positive temperature. We show that spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking occurs if and only if the system displays Bose-Einstein condensation in the sense that the one-particle density matrix of the Gibbs state has a macroscopic eigenvalue.

## 1. The Gibbs state of the mean-field Bose gas

**Authors:** Andreas Deuchert, Phan Thành Nam, Marcin Napiórkowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19396v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at temperatures proportional to the critical temperature of its Bose--Einstein condensation phase transition. Our main result is a trace-norm approximation of the grand canonical Gibbs state in terms of a reference state. Further results derived from the norm approximation include various limiting distributions for the number of particles in the condensate, as well as precise formulas for the one- and two-particle density matrices of the Gibbs state. We interpret this result as a justification of Bogoliubov theory at positive temperature.

## 2. On the Ising Phase Transition in the Infrared-Divergent Spin Boson Model

**Authors:** Volker Betz, Benjamin Hinrichs, Mino Nicola Kraft, Steffen Polzer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19362v1)

**Summary:**

We prove absence of ground states in the infrared-divergent spin boson model at large coupling. Our key argument reduces the proof to verifying long range order in the dual one-dimensional continuum Ising model. We also present an expansion for the vacuum overlap of thespin boson ground state in terms of the Ising $n$-point functions, which implies that the phase transition is unique, i.e., that there is a critical coupling constant below which a ground state exists and above which none can exist.

## 3. Modular covariant torus partition functions of dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and   dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models

**Authors:** Alexi Morin-Duchesne, Andreas Klümper, Paul A. Pearce

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19288v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19288v1)

**Summary:**

Yang-Baxter integrable loop models are considered on the torus in their simplest physical regimes. We conjecture the scaling limits of the transfer matrix traces in the standard modules with $d$ defects and deduce the conformal partition functions. Crucially, we find that the partition functions are identical for the dense and dilute models. The coincidence of these partition functions provides compelling evidence that, for given $(p,p')$, these dense and Dilute theories lie in the same universality class.

## 4. Top eigenvalue statistics of diluted Wishart matrices

**Authors:** Barak Budnick, Preben Forer, Pierpaolo Vivo, Sabrina Aufiero, Silvia Bartolucci, Fabio Caccioli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19280v1)

**Summary:**

Using the replica method, we compute analytically the average largest eigenvalue of diluted covariance matrices. We find excellent agreement between our analytical results and numerical results obtained from direct diagonalisation. By formulating the problem as the optimisation of a quadratic Hamiltonian constrained to the $N$-sphere at low temperatures, we derive a set of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions, which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. The average largesteigenvalue is identified with a Lagrange parameter that governs the convergence of the algorithm.

## 5. Entanglement and Stabilizer entropies of random bipartite pure quantum   states

**Authors:** Daniele Iannotti, Gianluca Esposito, Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Alioscia Hamma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19261v1)

**Summary:**

The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entangler and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-Stabilizerhood given the Schmidt spectrum. At a first approximation, entenlement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit.

## 6. Plasma dynamics in thin domains

**Authors:** Darryl D. Holm, Ruiao Hu, Oliver D. Street

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19171v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19171v1)

**Summary:**

In the present work, we study the geometric structures of the Rotating Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamics (RSW-MHD) equations through a Lie group invariant Euler-Poincar\'e variational principle. In this framework, we derive new, structure-preserving stochastic RSW-M HD models. The resulting stochastically RSW - MHD equations provide new capabilities for potential application to uncertainty quantification and data assimilation, for example, in space plasma and solar physics.

## 7. Exact Floquet solutions in a Parity-Time-Symmetric Rabi Model

**Authors:** M. Baradaran, D. Braak, L. M. Nieto, S. Zarrinkamar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19163v1)

**Summary:**

A semiclassical Rabi model with parity-time (PT) symmetry has a hidden $sl(2)$ symmetry and hence possesses quasi-exact solutions. These are located precisely at the exceptional points of the spectrum, the boundaries of the PT-symmetric phase. The corresponding constraints on the model parameters can be interpreted as a resonance relationship between the constant and periodic driving terms. It is shown that this relationship can be used to solve the Rabi equations for the Schrödinger equation.

## 8. New perspectives on the d'Alembertian from general relativity. An   invitation

**Authors:** Mathias Braun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19071v1)

**Summary:**

This survey has multiple objectives. We motivate and review a new distributional notion of the d'Alembertian from mathematical relativity. Unlike its classical linear yet hyperbolic counterpart, it is nonlinear yet has elliptic characteristics. Their new contribution implied by prior works on optimal transport through spacetime is a control of the timelike cut locus. We illustrate exact representation formulas for these $p$-d'Ale Ambertians employing methods from convex geometry. Fourth, several applications and open problems are presented.

## 9. Steady State Classification of Allee Effect System

**Authors:** Kuo Song, Xiaoxian Tang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19062v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19062v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we consider the steady state classification problem of the Allee effect system for multiple tribes. First, we reduce the high-dimensional model into several two-dimensional and three-dimensional algebraic systems. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for classifying the generic parameters according to the number of steady states. We successfully complete the computation for up to the seven-dimensional Allee Effect system. The paper was published in the Journal of Computer and Mathematical Science on November 14, 2013.

## 10. Entanglement Entropy and Cauchy-Hadamard Renormalization

**Authors:** Benoit Estienne, Jiasheng Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19014v1)

**Summary:**

This note presents a purely geometric construction of the so-called twist-field correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. This approach provides a purely mathematical interpretation of the seminal results in physics by Cardy and Calabrese. We also provide a discussion of the physical background and motivation for entanglement entropy, focusing on path integrals and the replica trick, which serves as an introduction to these ideas for a mathematical audience. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the theory of quantum systems.
