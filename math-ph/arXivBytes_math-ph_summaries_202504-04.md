## 0. Sharp connectivity bounds for the vacant set of random interlacements

**Authors:** Subhajit Goswami, Pierre-François Rodriguez, Yuriy Shulzhenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02777v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02777v1)

**Summary:**

We consider percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements at intensity $u$ in dimensions three and higher. We derive lower bounds on the truncated two-point function for all values of $u>0$. These bounds are sharp up to principal exponential order. In dimension three, our results further imply that the truncation grows at large distances $x$ at a rate that depends on $x $ only through its Euclidean norm. The rate function is atypical, it incurs a logarithmic correction.

## 1. Phase transitions for interacting particle systems on random graphs

**Authors:** Benedetta Bertoli, Grigorios A. Pavliotis, Niccolò Zagli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral analysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical simulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of stationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter.

## 2. Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations as Electrostatic Equilibria: A   Generalized Thomson Problem in Convex Domains

**Authors:** Zachary Mullaghy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02700v1)

**Summary:**

Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVTs) arise as local minimizers of a generalized electrostatic energy functional. We prove this by showing that CVTs minimize both the classical centroidal energy and the electrostatic potential. We introduce a thermodynamic annealing scheme for global CVT optimization, rooted in Boltzmann statistics and random walk dynamics. By introducing a scheme for varying time steps (faster or slower cooling) we show that the set of minima of the centroid energy functional can be recovered.

## 3. Quantized Markov chain couplings that prepare Qsamples

**Authors:** Kristan Temme, Pawel Wocjan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02651v1)

**Summary:**

The approach is based on the Markov chain coupling method, which is frequently used to prove fast mixing. Given a particular coupling, e.g., a grand coupling, we construct a completely positive and trace preserving map. This quantum map has a unique fixed point, which corresponds to the quantum sample (qsample) of the classical MarkovChain's stationary distribution. We show that the convergence time of the quantum map is directly related to the coupling time of Markov Chain coupling. We present a novel approach to quantizing Markov chains.

## 4. Derivation of the Landau-Zener formula via functional equations

**Authors:** Chen Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02576v1)

**Summary:**

The Landau-Zener formula describes the diabatic transition probability of a two-level system under linear driving. Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. We prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation.

## 5. The Spear and the Ring: Emergent Structures in Magnetic Colloidal   Suspensions

**Authors:** Raphaël Côte, Clémentine Courtès, Guillaume Ferrière, Ludovic Godard-Cadillac, Yannick Privat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02379v1)

**Summary:**

We study from a mathematical point of view the nanoparticle model of a magnetic colloid, presented by G. Klughertz. Our objective is to obtain properties of stable stationary structures that arise in the long-time limit for the magnetic nanoparticles dynamics following this model. We present a detailed study of two specific structures using techniques from the calculus of variations. The first, called the spear, consists of a chain of aligned particles interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential. The second structure, the ring, features particles uniformly distributed along a circle.

## 6. Double groupoids of composites: applications to uniformity

**Authors:** V. M. Jiménez, M. De León, M. Epstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02363v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we present a geometrical framework to study the uniformity of a composite material by means of double groupoid theory. The notions of vertical and horizontal uniformity are introduced, as well as other weaker ones that allows us to study other possible notions of more general uniformity. We also present a framework that can be used to study more general notions of uniformity, such as the shape of the surface of a material. We conclude with a discussion of the role of the groupoid in the study of composite materials.

## 7. Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory

**Authors:** Sourav Chatterjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348v1)

**Summary:**

Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Timelike field theory is a version of Liouville where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign. This makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) LiouVILLE field theory. Such a theory is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition"

## 8. Spectral asymmetry via pseudodifferential projections: the massless   Dirac operator

**Authors:** Matteo Capoferri, Beatrice Costeri, Claudio Dappiaggi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02336v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02336v1)

**Summary:**

A new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on closed manifolds was proposed in a recent series of papers by the first author and collaborator. They showed that information on spectral asymmetric can be encoded within and recovered from a negative order pseudodifferential operator. In this manuscript we apply these techniques to thestudy of the massless Dirac operator. We compute the principal symbol of the asymmetry operator, accounting for the underlying gauge invariance.

## 9. Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations in Deligne categories

**Authors:** Pavel Etingof, Ivan Motorin, Alexander Varchenko, Isaac Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02266v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02266v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations in Deligne Categories in the context of dualities. We derive integral formulas for the solutions in the first case and compute monodromy in both cases. In the second case, we use an integral formula for the solution in the third case. We conclude that the solutions to the equations are equivalent to the same as those in the previous case. The equations are then solved for the dualities in the second and third cases.

## 10. On the Clustering of Conditional Mutual Information via Dissipative   Dynamics

**Authors:** Kohtaro Kato, Tomotaka Kuwahara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02235v1)

**Summary:**

Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. Previous work addressed this problem in the high-temperatures regime using cluster expansion techniques. But flaws in the proof have been pointed out, and the method does not provide a uniformly convergent expansion at arbitrarily high temperatures.

## 11. Quantum Gibbs states are locally Markovian

**Authors:** Chi-Fang Chen, Cambyse Rouzé

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02208v1)

**Summary:**

For any Hamiltonian with a bounded interaction degree, the quantum Gibbs state is locally Markov at arbitrary temperature. The Markov property entails the conditional independence structure inherent in Gibbs distributions for general classical Hamiltonians. We believe these tools pave the way for tackling further challenges in quantum thermodynamics and mixing times, particularly in low-temperature regimes. We also reveal a connection between the Dirichlet form, a dynamic quantity, and the commutator in the KMS inner product, a static quantity.

## 12. Solvable Structures for Hamiltonian Systems

**Authors:** Sasa Kresic-Juric, Concepcion Muriel, Adrian Ruiz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02189v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02189v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate solvable structures associated to Hamiltonian equations. For a completely integrable Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom, we construct a canonical solvable structure consisting of $2n$ Hamiltonian vector fields. We show that the upper $n $ forms give the action varibles, while the lower $ n$ forms yield the angle variables of the system. This offers a novel interpretation of the Arnold--Liouville theorem in terms ofsolvable structures.
