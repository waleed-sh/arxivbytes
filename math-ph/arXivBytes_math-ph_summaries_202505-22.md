## 0. Rapid phase ordering for Ising and Potts dynamics on random regular   graphs

**Authors:** Reza Gheissari, Allan Sly, Youngtak Sohn

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15783v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15783v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the Ising, and more generally, $q$-state Potts Glauber dynamics on random $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices at low temperatures. We prove that for any $d\ge 7$, from biased initializations with $\epsilon_d n$ more vertices in state-$1$ than in other states, the dynamics quasi-equilibrates to the stationary distribution. We introduce a coupled non-Markovian rigid dynamics for which a delicate temporal recursion on probability mass functions of minus spacetime cluster sizes establishes their subcriticality.

## 1. Fluctuations of Young diagrams for symplectic groups and semiclassical   orthogonal polynomials

**Authors:** Anton Nazarov, Anton Selemenchuk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15726v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15726v1)

**Summary:**

Dual RSK algorithm gives a bijection of this matrix to a pair of Young tableaux of conjugate shape, which is manifestation of skew Howe duality. The study of the asymptotic of this integral representation gives us the description of the limit shapes and fluctuations of the random Young diagrams for symplectic groups. In the limit when $n,k\to\infty$ $GL$-case is relatively easily studied by use of free-fermionic representation for the correlation kernel.

## 2. Explicit isomorphisms for the symmetry algebras of continuous and   discrete isotropic oscillators

**Authors:** Pavel Drozdov, Giorgio Gubbiotti, Danilo Latini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15672v1)

**Summary:**

We present a detailed study of a parametric Lie algebra encompassing the symmetry algebras of the isotropic oscillator and one of its possible deformations. We show that such a Lie algebra appears naturally also within the context of maximally superintegrable discretizations of the harmonic oscillator. We construct explicit isomorphism maps to the Lie algebra in $N$ dimensions, respectively. We also show that the harmonics admits a Nambu-Hamiltonian structure.

## 3. Relative phase and dynamical phase sensing in a Hamiltonian model of the   optical SU(1,1) interferometer

**Authors:** T. J. Volkoff

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15635v1)

**Summary:**

The SU(1,1) interferometer introduced by Yurke, McCall, Klauder is reformulated starting from the Hamiltonian of two identical optical downconversion processes with opposite pump phases. From the four optical modes, two are singled out up to a relative phase by the assumption of exact alignment. The state of the two resulting modes is parametrized by the nonlinearity $g$ and a dynamical phase $theta$ resulting from the interaction time. The optimal operating point for sensing the relative phase (dynamical phase) is found to be $phi = \pi$ ($\theta=0$).

## 4. Permutons from Demazure Products

**Authors:** Colin Defant

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15630v1)

**Summary:**

We construct and analyze several new families of permutons arising from random processes involving the Demazure product on the symmetric group. These models belong to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) universality class. A crucial tool in our analysis is a formulation, due to Chan and Pflueger, of the Demzure product as matrix multiplication in the min-plus tropical semiring. We discuss further applications of this product. For instance, we show that the number of inversions of theDemazure. product of two independent uniformly random permutations of size $n$ is $\binom{n}{2}(1-o(1))$.

## 5. Lecture notes on large deviations in non-equilibrium diffusive systems

**Authors:** Bernard Derrida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15618v1)

**Summary:**

These notes are a written version of lectures given in the 2024 Les Houches Summer School on Large deviations and applications. They are based on a series of works published over the last 25 years on steady properties of non-equilibrium systems in contact with several heat baths at different temperatures or several reservoirs of particles at different densities. They describe some of the basic ideas of the macroscopic fluctuation theory allowing to determine the large deviation functions of the density and of the current of diffusive systems.

## 6. Simple Sufficient Criteria for Optimality of Entanglement Witnesses

**Authors:** Frederik vom Ende, Simon Cichy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15615v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15615v1)

**Summary:**

The current standard approach is to check whether a bipartite entanglement witness has the spanning property. This is not necessary for optimality, but it is most often satisfied in practice. In this work we introduce a novel characterization of the property via entanglements-breaking channels. This in turn leads to a new sufficient criterion for optimally checking the kernel of some bipartITE state. Finally, this approach implies new spectral constraints on witnesses as well as on positive maps. It is slightly weaker than the. spanning property, but is a lot easier to test for -- by hand.

## 7. Entanglement of Inhomogeneous Free Bosons and Orthogonal Polynomials

**Authors:** Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Gilles Parez, Eric Ragoucy, David Raveh, Luc Vinet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15610v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. We find a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results, finding a perfect matching between the analytical and numerical results.

## 8. On braided Hopf structures on exterior algebras

**Authors:** Rinat Kashaev, Vladimir Mangazeev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15569v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the exterior algebra of a vector space $V$ of dimension greater than one admits a one-parameter family of braided Hopf algebra structures. We explicitly compute the structure constants with respect to a natural set-theoretic basis. These solutions are conjectured to give rise to the two-variable Links--Gould polynomial invariants associated with the super-quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(N|1))$, where $N = \dim(V)$.

## 9. Some exact results on the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario

**Authors:** Piotr P. Goldstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15541v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15541v1)

**Summary:**

Bielinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario for the universe near the cosmological singularity is supplemented with a few exact results following from the BKL asymptotic. The universe undergoes oscillations of Kasner type, which reduce the length scales to nearly zero in some directions, while largely extending it in the others. Reduced equations are proposed and explicitly solved to describe these oscillations near their turning points. In logarithmic variables, the oscillations are found to have sawtooth shapes.

## 10. Measuring inequality in society-oriented Lotka--Volterra-type kinetic   equations

**Authors:** Marco Menale, Giuseppe Toscani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15526v1)

**Summary:**

Wealth and opinion formation models tend to converge toward a steady-state profile. This makes tracking the evolution of most inequality measures challenging. We present a possible approach to measuring inequality in a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. The coefficient of variation, a simple inequality measure closely linked to the Gini index, can provide an insightful perspective on the problem, we say. We conclude that, despite the system's oscillatory nature, inequality initially tends to decrease in the system.

## 11. $Ï†^3$ theory at six loops

**Authors:** Oliver Schnetz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15485v1)

**Summary:**

We present the renormalization functions of dimensionally regularized $\phi^3$ theory in six dimensions up to loop order six in the minimal subtraction scheme. We show that these functions are renormalized in six different ways. We also show that this theory can be generalized to other dimensions. We conclude that this is the most general way to generalize the theory to six different dimensions. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Back To the pageYou Came From.

## 12. Hamiltonian reductions, scalings, and effective wave models in   stratified fluids

**Authors:** Gregorio Falqui, Eleonora Sforza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15225v1)

**Summary:**

We apply Poisson reduction techniques to describe asymptotic fully nonlinear models of fluid wave motion in the Hamiltonian setting. We start by considering Zakharov and Benjamin Hamiltonian settings for a stably stratified $2D$ Euler fluid. We use a Marsden-Ratiu reduction scheme for sharply stratified fluids to obtain a canonical formulation of the stratified effective model in one space variable. We also study the reduced Hamiltonian system obtained taking the natural constraints of the CC equations into account.

## 13. Canonical Structure and Hidden Symmetries in Scalar Field Cosmology

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15207v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. We construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of transformations can relate the solution spaces of different models, such as of the scalarField and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.

## 14. Stability of Riemann Shocks for isothermal Euler by Inviscid limits of   global-in-time large Navier-Stokes flows

**Authors:** Saehoon Eo, Namhyun Eun, Moon-Jin Kang, HyeonSeop Oh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15078v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15078v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the isothermal gas dynamics. We first establish the global existence of strong solutions to the one-dimensional isothermal Navier-Stokes system. We then prove a contraction property for the strong solutions perturbed from viscous shocks. This covers any large perturbations, and consequently, we establish the inviscid limits and their stability estimate. The result allows for possibly degenerate viscosity coefficients and admits different asymptotic states at the far fields.

## 15. Gap modes in Arnold tongues and their topological origins

**Authors:** Andrew Brown, Hong Qin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15007v1)

**Summary:**

Gap modes in a modified Mathieu equation, perturbed by a Dirac delta potential, are investigated. The modes may be identified as localized electron wavefunctions in a 1D chain or as toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes. Gap modes can be induced in regimes of instability by localized potential perturbations for a large class of periodic Hamiltonians. It is proved that the Mathieu equations admits stable isolated gap modes with topological origins in the unstable regions.

## 16. Exact spin helix eigenstates in anisotropic spin-$s$ Heisenberg model in   arbitrary dimensions

**Authors:** Mingchen Zheng, Chenguang Liang, Shu Chen, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14994v1)

**Summary:**

 Spin-helix states are exact eigenstates of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ Heisenberg chain. They are characterized by spatially modulated spin textures appearing under special parameter conditions. The XXZ and XY limits are also analyzed to clarify the properties and constraints of these spin helix eigen States. The results broaden the class of analytically tractable exact eigenestates in quantum spin systems and deepen understanding of spatially inhomogeneous states in complex many-body systems.
