## 0. Non-standard quantum algebras and infinite-dimensional PT-symmetric   systems

**Authors:** Ángel Ballesteros, Romina Ramírez, Marta Reboiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21833v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we introduce a PT-symmetric infinite-dimensional representation of the Uz(sl(2,R) Hopf algebra. We analyse a multiparametric family of Hamiltonians constructed from such representation. It is shown that all these Hamiltonians can be mapped to equivalent systems endowed with a position-dependent mass. We present a particular Hamiltonian that can be expressed as an effective double-well trigonometric potential, which is commonly used to model several relevant systems in molecular physics.

## 1. A simple range characterization for spherical mean transform in even   dimensions

**Authors:** Divyansh Agrawal, Gaik Ambartsoumian, Venkateswaran P. Krishnan, Nisha Singhal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21824v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21824v1)

**Summary:**

The paper presents a new and simple range characterization for the spherical mean transform of functions supported in the unit ball in even dimensions. It complements the previous work of the same authors, where they solved an analogous problem in odd dimensions. The range description consists of symmetry relations, using a special kind of elliptic integrals involving the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansion of the function in the range of the transform. The article also introduces a pair of original identities involving normalized Bessel functions of the first and the second kind.

## 2. Combinatorial twists in gl_n Yangians

**Authors:** Anastasia Doikou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21690v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra and show that it is a Hopf algebra. The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an admissible Drinfel'd twist, making the algebra a quasi-triangular Hopfgebra. We then apply the same Drinfle'd twist to the gl_n Yangian after introducing the augmented Yangian. We obtain the twisted version of the augmented gl_ n Yangian as well as the twisted R- matrix.

## 3. Flow Through Porous Media: A Hopf-Cole Transformation Approach for   Modeling Pressure-Dependent Viscosity

**Authors:** V. S. Maduri, K. B. Nakshatrala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21603v1)

**Summary:**

Most organic liquids exhibit a pressure-dependent viscosity. This makes it crucial to consider this behavior in applications where pressures significantly exceed ambient conditions. Mathematical models describing flow through porous media are nonlinear. This nonlinearity complicates mathematical analysis and makes numerical solutions more time-intensive and prone to convergence issues. The Hopf-Cole transformation can recast the governing equations into a linear form, enabling efficient numerical solutions using solvers optimized for Darcy equations. The transformed equations, resembling Darcy's equations in the transformed variables, enable (a) systematic mathematical analysis to establish uniqueness and maximum principles.

## 4. Optimizing the ground state energy of the three-dimensional magnetic   Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field

**Authors:** Matthias Baur

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21597v1)

**Summary:**

This paper concerns the shape optimization problem of minimizing the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, a generalized ''magnetic'' Faber-Krahn inequality does not hold and the minimizers are not expected to be balls when the magnetic field is turned on. An analysis of the problem among cylindrical domains reveals geometric constraints for general minimizers. In particular, minimizers must elongate with a certain rate along the direction of the field as the field strength increases.

## 5. Schwinger's non-commutative coordinates and duality between helicity and   Dirac quantisation conditions

**Authors:** George Savvidy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21529v1)

**Summary:**

The helicity operator of massless particles has only two polarisations like it takes place for photons and gravitons. For them not all of the 2s+1 spin magnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions. The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operators appear explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity.

## 6. Multi-lump, lump-kink and interaction of breather with other nonlinear   waves of a couple Boussinesq system

**Authors:** Snehalata Nasipuri, Prasanta Chatterjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21506v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the interaction characteristics of nonlinear coherent structures in the couple Boussinesq (CB) system. We study the explicit interactions between lumps and one or two-kink waves, and observe double lump patterns. We discover the interactions of breathers, revealing a diffusion-like behavior. We analyze our results using a combination of symbolic computations and graphical representations, providing a deeper understanding of their behavior. This study reveals previously unreported nonlinear dynamics in the CB system.

## 7. Dual $κ$-Minkowski spaces and $κ$-Poincaré algebras from   Yang model and their Weyl realizations

**Authors:** T. Martinić Bilać, S. Meljanac, S. Mignemi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21482v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the Yang algebras isomorphic to $o(1,5), o(2,4) and o(3,3) The corresponding Weyl realization is presented and coproduct, star product and twist are computed in terms of the metric $g$. Finally, we construct reduced $\kappa$-Minkowski and $kappa-Poincar\'{e} algebraes as special cases. The corresponding reduced Weyl realizes are presented and Coproduct and Star Product are computed.

## 8. Imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on a torus and on a pair of   balls

**Authors:** Denis S. Grebenkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21449v1)

**Summary:**

We employ a general spectral approach based on the Steklov eigenbasis to describe imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on bounded reactive targets in three dimensions. The steady-state concentration and the total diffusive flux onto the target are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the exterior Stekslov problem. Using toroidal and bispherical coordinates, we propose an efficient procedure for analyzing and solving numerically this spectral problem. Implications of these results in the context of chemical physics and beyond are discussed.

## 9. Ultra-discretization of Yang-Baxter maps, probability distributions and   independence preserving property

**Authors:** Hiroki Kondo, Sachiko Nakajima, Makiko Sasada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359v1)

**Summary:**

Yang-B Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied in arXiv:0911.2895. Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems. We explore implications of our results for stationary distributions ofintegrable system and pose several open questions. The study was published in the open-access journal ArXiv.

## 10. Drinfeld super Yangian of the exceptional Lie superalgebra   $D(2,1;λ)$

**Authors:** Hongda Lin, Honglian Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21255v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we establish the first rigorous framework for the Drinfeld super Yangian associated with an exceptional Lie superalgebra, which lacks a classical Lie algebraic counterpart. A key innovation is the construction of a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt (PBW) basis using degeneration techniques from the corresponding quantum loop superal algebra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the superYangian possesses a Hopfsuperalgebra structure, explicitly providing the coproduct, counit, and antipode.
