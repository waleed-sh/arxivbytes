## 0. Hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold

**Authors:** Tadahiro Oh, Younes Zine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07944v1)

**Summary:**

We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\beta^2 > 0$, and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. The deterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear estimates, featuring weighted bounds for a cone multiplier. The probabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time light cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $6\pi$ as a critical threshold for the model, which is quite surprising given the associated parabolic model has a threshold at $8\pi$.

## 1. SKK groups of manifolds and non-unitary invertible TQFTs

**Authors:** Renee S. Hoekzema, Luuk Stehouwer, Simona Veselá

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07917v1)

**Summary:**

This work considers the computation of controllable cut-and-paste groups of manifolds with tangential structure. The order of this sphere can be computed by knowing the possible values of the Euler characteristic of $\xi$-manifolds. These groups are of interest in physics as they play a role in the classification of non-unitary invertible topological quantum field theories, which classify anomalies and symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of matter. Applying our topological results, we give a complete classification ofNon-Unitary Invertible Topological Quantum Field theories in the tenfold way in dimensions 1-5.

## 2. Phase diagram for intermittent maps

**Authors:** Daniel Coronel, Juan Rivera-Letelier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07864v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07864v1)

**Summary:**

There is always a phase where the unique Gibbs state exhibits intermittent behavior. It coincides with the set of potentials at which the pressure function fails to be real-analytic. We also describe the relationship between the phase transition locus, (persistent) phase transitions in temperature, and ground states. We explore the phase diagram for potentials in the space of H\"older continuous functions of a given exponent and for the dynamical system generated by a Pomeau--Manneville, or intermittent, map.

## 3. $q$-Differential Operators for $q$-Spinor Variables

**Authors:** Julio Cesar Jaramillo Quiceno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07735v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07735v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we introduce the $q$-differential operator for $q $-spinor variables. We also define the $Q$- spinor differential equation. The suggestions for further work are at the end of the paper. We establish the $ q$- Spinor chain rule and the new $q-spinOr chain rule. The $q-$-Dirac differential operators are also defined for spinor integrals. We conclude with a list of possible solutions to the spinor equation.

## 4. Mock Eisenstein series associated to partition ranks

**Authors:** Kathrin Bringmann, Badri Vishal Pandey, Jan-Willem van Ittersum

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07713v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we introduce a new class of mock Eisenstein series, describe their modular properties, and write the partition rank generating function in terms of so-called partition traces of these. We show the Fourier coefficients of the mock Eisenstone series are integral and we obtain a holomorphic anomaly equation for their completions. We also show that the series are modular and that they can be written as a series of real numbers. The paper is published by the American Mathematical Society at the request of the author.

## 5. Four-loop renormalization with a cutoff in a sextic model

**Authors:** N. V. Kharuk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07688v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum action for a three-dimensional real sextic model using the background field method is considered. Four-loop renormalization of this model is performed with a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation. The explicit form of the singularities, power and logarithmic, as well as their dependence on the deformation of the Green's function are discussed. The applicability of the $\mathcal{R}$-operation within the proposed regularization is explicitly demonstrated, and the absence of nonlocal contributions is proved.

## 6. Uniqueness of supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos

**Authors:** Federico Bertacco, Martin Hairer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07552v1)

**Summary:**

We show that for general convolution approximations to a large class of log-correlated Gaussian fields, the properly normalised supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures converge stably to a nontrivial limit. This limit depends on the choice of regularisation only through a multiplicative constant and can be characterised as an integrated atomic measure with a random intensity expressed in terms of the critical Gaussianmultiplicative chaos. We present our results in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

## 7. Mass-subcritical Half-Wave Equation with mixed nonlinearities: existence   and non-existence of ground states

**Authors:** Jacopo Bellazzini, Luigi Forcella

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07488v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the problem of existence of constrained minimizers for the focusing mass-subcritical Half-Wave equation. We show the existence of a critical mass such that minimizers do exist for any mass larger than or equal to the critical one, and do not exist below it. At the dynamical level, in the one dimensional case, we show that the ground states are orbitally stable. We conclude that the minimizers exist for a given critical mass and that they are constrained.
