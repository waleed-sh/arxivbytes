## 0. Classification of Gapped Domain Walls of Topological Orders in 2+1   dimensions: A Levin-Wen Model Realization

**Authors:** Yanyan Chen, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yuting Hu, Yidun Wan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07664v1)

**Summary:**

This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model. We achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, encompassing $e$-$m$ exchanging GDWs. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. We demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model.

## 1. On First-Order GLSM for Sigma Models

**Authors:** Viacheslav Krivorol

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07612v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07612v1)

**Summary:**

We review some recent developments in 1-st order GLSM construction, or so-called Gross-Neveu formalism for sigma models. Then, we formulate a general statement that answers the question of which generalized Gross- Neveu models are equivalent to s Sigma models on compact homogeneous Hermitian spaces of classical groups endowed with the normal metrics. We describe the general idea behind this framework and describe a 1-St order G LSM data from which the general generalized Gross NeveU model can be constructed.

## 2. Gauge Origami and BPS/CFT correspondence

**Authors:** Go Noshita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573v1)

**Summary:**

Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components. It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami system and its BPS/CFT correspondence. We also investigate quadratic relations among $qq$-characters and the representations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$. We demonstrate that the fusion of $qq’s of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-Brane $qq $-char characters.

## 3. Exact Schwinger functions for a class of bounded interactions in $d\geq   2$

**Authors:** Wojciech Dybalski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07546v1)

**Summary:**

We find a field renormalization such that all the $n$-point connected Schwinger functions for $n\neq 2$ exist non-perturbatively in the UV limit. Non-Gaussianity of these latter theories is governed by a discontinuity of $V$ at zero. The open problem of controlling also the two-point function of these QFTs is discussed. We consider a scalar Euclidean QFT with interaction given by a bounded, measurable function $V.

## 4. Gaussian Free Field and Discrete Gaussians in Periodic Dimer Models

**Authors:** Tomas Berggren, Matthew Nicoletti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07241v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze height fluctuations in Aztec diamond dimer models with nearly arbitrary periodic edge weights. We show that the centered height function approximates the sum of two independent components: a Gaussian free field on the multiply connected liquid region and a harmonic function with random liquid-gas boundary values. The boundary values are jointly distributed as a discrete Gaussian random vector. This discreteGaussian distribution maintains a quasi-periodic dependence on $N$, a phenomenon also observed in multi-cut random matrix models.

## 5. Moments of characteristic polynomials for classical $β$ ensembles

**Authors:** Bo-Jian Shen, Peter J. Forrester

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07142v1)

**Summary:**

Large $N$ form of moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial is known to be of relevance to the moments of Riemann zeta function on the critical line. The constant (with respect to $N) in this asymptotic expansion, involving the Barnes $G$ function, also appears in other classical ensembles with unitary symmetry, for example the Gaussian unitary ensemble. Using certain duality formulas for averages over powers of characteristic Polynomials, this same effect is studied.
