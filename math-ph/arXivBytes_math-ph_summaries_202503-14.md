## 0. Thermodynamic correlation inequalities for finite times and transients

**Authors:** Cai Dieball, Aljaž Godec

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10599v1)

**Summary:**

Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables. We generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations.

## 1. A Simple Description of the Hyperkähler Structure of the Cotangent   Bundle of Projective Space via Quantization

**Authors:** Joshua Lackman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10570v1)

**Summary:**

Quantization identifies the cotangent bundle of projective space with the (non-Hermitian) rank-$1$ projections of a Hilbert space. We show that the quantization map is an isometric and complex embedding. Using this, we give a complete, simple and explicit description of the hyperk\"{a}hler structure. Our constructions are functorial, coordinate-free and reduction-free. We use this identification to study the natural geometric structures of these cotsangent bundles and those of Grassmanians.

## 2. Current fluctuations for the second class particle : joint statistics

**Authors:** Sylvain Prolhac

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10531v1)

**Summary:**

We consider TASEP with a single second class particle and periodic boundary conditions. Using Bethe ansatz, we compute stationary large deviations for the joint statistics of the current of first and second class particles. At large scales, the generating function of the joint cumulants shows an unexpected connection to current fluctuations of TAS EP with open boundaries. We show that the joint Cumulants show a strong connection to the current fluctuations in T ASEP with open borders. We also show that this connection can be extended to other types of particles, such as atoms and molecules.

## 3. Deep Learning based discovery of Integrable Systems

**Authors:** Shailesh Lal, Suvajit Majumder, Evgeny Sobko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10469v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10469v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.

## 4. Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants in the Solutions of   Einstein Equations

**Authors:** Leyla Ogurol, Bayram Tekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454v1)

**Summary:**

In Einstein's equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can in principle be measured is a non-trivial matter. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.

## 5. No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary   dynamics

**Authors:** Akira Sone, Akram Touil, Kenji Maeda, Paola Cappellaro, Sebastian Deffner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. We prove that the unitary operation on the system's subspace uniquely determines the corresponding unitary operator on the environment's sub space. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations.

## 6. On zeros of polynomials associated with Heun class equations

**Authors:** Mizuki Mori, Kouichi Takemura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10355v1)

**Summary:**

Schafke and Schmidt established that the asymptotics of the coefficients of the local solution to some linear differential equation is related to global structures of solutions. By calculating the zeros of the polynomials numerically, we obtain the data of the spectral related to the Heun class equations numerically. The Heun classes of equations have the accessory parameters, and we investigate the poyleomials whose variable is the accessory parameter which appears as the coefficient of a local solution.

## 7. Quantum Theory, Gravity and Higher Order Geometry

**Authors:** Folkert Kuipers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10348v1)

**Summary:**

The fact that quantum theory is non-differentiable, while general relativity is built on the assumption of differentiability sources an incompatibility between quantum theory and gravity. Higher order geometry addresses this issue directly by extending differential geometry. As this includes the path integral formulation of quantum theory, it provides a natural mathematical framework for describing the interplay between gravity and quantum theory. In this article, we review the motivation for and the basic features of this framework. We also point towards future developments in this area.

## 8. Analysis of linear Boussinesq-type models coupled with static interfaces

**Authors:** José Galaz, Maria Kazolea, Antoine Rousseau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10300v1)

**Summary:**

We derive a new approach to analyze the coupling of linear Boussinesq and Saint-Venant shallow water wave equations in the case where the interface remains at a constant position in space. We propose a one-way coupling model as a reference, which allows us to obtain an analytical solution. We show that the coupling error consists of reflected waves and argue that this explains some previously unexplained spurious oscillations reported in the literature. Finally, we prove the well-posedness of the half-line linear BOUSsinesqu problem.

## 9. On the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for operator fields in   small dimensions and Tempesta-Tondo conjecture

**Authors:** Alexey V. Bolsinov, Andrey Yu. Konyaev, Vladimir S. Matveev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10208v1)

**Summary:**

In dimensions three and four, we find tensorial conditions for an operator field $L$, similar to a nilpotent Jordan block. We prove the Tempesta-Tondo conjecture for higher order brackets of Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis type. We explore the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for a operator field in small dimensions. We find local coordinates in which $L$ takes a strictly upper triangular form. We conclude that $L $ is a Jordan block in dimensions 3 and 4.

## 10. Surrogate modeling of resonant behavior in scattering problems through   adaptive rational approximation and sketching

**Authors:** Davide Pradovera, Ralf Hiptmair, Ilaria Perugia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10194v1)

**Summary:**

This paper describes novel algorithms for the identification of (almost-)resonant behavior in scattering problems. Our methods, relying on rational approximation, aim at building surrogate models of what we call "field amplification" Some of our proposed methods apply rational approximation in a "standard" way, building a rational approximant for either the solution operator directly or for a randomly "sketched" version of it. Our other "hybrid" approaches are more innovative, combining rational-approximation-assisted root-finding with approximation using radial basis functions.

## 11. On Sufficient and Necessary Criteria of Multipartite Quantum   Entanglement

**Authors:** Zhi-Bo Chen, Shao-Ming Fei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10123v1)

**Summary:**

We study the separability of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum states. Some sufficient and some necessary criteria are presented. For certain states, these criteria together are both sufficient and necessary. Detailed examples show that our criteria are better than some existing ones in identifying entanglement. The largest separable ball around the maximally mixed state for arbitrary multi-qubit systems is found, and it is proved that its radius is the constant 1. Furthermore, the criteria in this paper can be implemented experimentally.

## 12. $T\overline{T}$ Deformation: Introduction and Some Recent Advances

**Authors:** Song He, Yi Li, Hao Ouyang, Yuan Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997v1)

**Summary:**

This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $ T\bar T$-like deformation, including holographic entanglement and single-trace deformations. The paper examines the profound relationship between $T \bar {T} $ deformation and holographs, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holographY proposal.

## 13. Velocity Averaging for the Wigner Kinetic Equation in the Semiclassical   Regime

**Authors:** François Golse, Jakob Möller

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09924v1)

**Summary:**

This paper discusses the possibility of applying the velocity averaging theorems in [F. Golse, P.-L. Lions, B. Perthame, R. Sentis: J. Funct. Anal. 76(1):110--125, 1988] to the Wigner equation governing the quantum evolution of quantum density operators. In the case of pure states, we first obtain a characterization of the Wigneder transform of rank-one quantum density Operators. We then apply this characterization to analyze a rather general setting in which velocity averaging cannot apply to a family of density operators whose evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation.
