## 0. Exactly solvable many-body dynamics from space-time duality

**Authors:** Bruno Bertini, Pieter W. Claeys, Tomaž Prosen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11489v1)

**Summary:**

Recent years have seen significant advances in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified. They allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. They constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution.

## 1. Noise sensitivity of crossings for high temperature Ising model

**Authors:** Vincent Tassion, Hugo Vanneuville

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11457v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11457v1)

**Summary:**

We show that this event is noise sensitive under Glauber dynamics. We rely on the non-spectral approach from our previous work [TV23]. An important aspect in this more general setup is the study of the pair $(\sigma_0,\s Sigma_t)$ and in particular the establishment of properties such as finite-energy and spatial mixing. We show that $+$ crossing from left to right in a box for the Ising model on the triangular lattice is a noise sensitive event.

## 2. On Kerr black hole formation with complete apparent horizon and a new   approach toward Penrose inequality

**Authors:** Xinliang An, Taoran He

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11399v1)

**Summary:**

We show that 3+1 dimensional Einstein vacuum equations admit dynamical Kerr black hole formation solutions. Our hyperbolic arguments combine the scale-critical gravitational-collapse result by An--Luk with the recent breakthrough by Klainerman--Szeftel on proving nonlinear Kerr stability with small angular momentum. Collectively, without assuming any symmetry, we extend Christodoulou's celebrated trapped surface formation theorem to a black Hole formation result. We then put forward a new mathematical framework and prove both the dynamical Penrose inequality and the spacetime Penroseequality in our black-hole formation spacetimes.

## 3. Ergodicity of the Anderson $Φ_2^4$ model

**Authors:** Eulry Hugo, Mouzard Antoine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11337v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the parabolic stochastic quantization equation associated to the $\Phi_2^4$ model on the torus in a spatial white noise environment. The quenched solution given the environment is shown to be an infinite dimensional Markov process which satisfies the strong Feller property. We prove exponential convergence to a unique invariant measure using a Doeblin criterion for the transition semigroup. In particular, our work is a generalization of a previous work by Tsatsoulis and Weber in a case which is not translation invariant hence the method makes no use of the reversibility of the dynamics.

## 4. Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based   quantum resources

**Authors:** Arindam Mitra, Sumit Mukherjee, Changhyoup Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11331v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11331v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. The framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. It is expected to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.

## 5. Theta classes: generalized topological recursion, integrability and   $\mathcal{W}$-constraints

**Authors:** Vincent Bouchard, Nitin K. Chidambaram, Alessandro Giacchetto, Sergey Shadrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11291v1)

**Summary:**

We study the intersection theory of the $\Theta^{r,s}-classes, which are cohomological field theories obtained as the top degrees of Chiodo classes. We show that the descendant potential of the $r$-KdV hierarchy is a tau function, generalizing the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten taufunction. We also explicitly compute the $\mathcal{W}$-constraints satisfied by the descendants potential. This work extends previously known results on the Witten $r-spin class, the $ r$-spin $Theta$-classes and the Norbury $TheTA-classes.

## 6. Metastability for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model with unbounded random   interactions

**Authors:** Johan L. A. Dubbeldam, Vicente Lenz Burnier, Elena Pulvirenti, Martin Slowik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11260v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse the metastable behaviour of the disordered Curie-Weiss-Potts (DCWP) model subject to a Glauber dynamics. The model is a randomly disordered version of the mean-field $q$-spin Potts model (CWP) We establish the metastability of the CWP model and, using this result, prove metastability for the DCWP model (with high probability) The system evolves as a discrete-time Markov chain with single spin flip Metropolis dynamics at finite inverse temperature.

## 7. A Framework of Model Reduction with Arbitrary Orders of Accuracy for the   Boltzmann Equation

**Authors:** Zhenning Cai, Ruo Li, Yixiao Lu, Yanli Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11184v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11184v1)

**Summary:**

This paper presents a general framework for constructing reduced models that approximate the Boltzmann equation with arbitrary orders of accuracy. The framework is based on an orthogonal decomposition of the distribution function into components of different orders. Compared to the Chapman-Enskog expansion, our approach yields more tractable model structures. As concrete applications, we explicitly derive 13-moment systems of Burnett and super-Burnett orders valid for arbitrary collision models. We establish that a reduced model retaining all terms up to $O(\mathit{Kn}^n)$ in the expansion surprisingly yields models with order of accuracy $O (-1)

## 8. Conformal transformations of spacetimes without observer horizons

**Authors:** Leonardo García-Heveling, Abdelghani Zeghib

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11148v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that for a certain class of Lorentzian manifolds, namely causal spacetimes without observer horizons, conformal transformations can be classified into two types: escaping and non-escaping. This means that successive powers of a given conformal transformation will either send all points to infinity, or none. We also study the question of essentiality in this context, i.e. which conformal Transformations are isometric for some metric in the conformal class. As an application, we classify the conformal transformations of Einstein's static universe.

## 9. Propagation of Love waves in linear elastic isotropic Cosserat materials

**Authors:** Marius Apetrii, Emilian Bulgariu, Ionel-Dumitrel Ghiba, Hassam Khan, Patrizio Neff

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11103v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11103v1)

**Summary:**

Method commonly used to study Rayleigh wave propagation is also applicable to the analysis of Love wave propagation. This approach is based on the explicit solution of an algebraic Riccati equation, which operates independently of the traditional Stroh formalism. The method guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a subsonic wave speed, addressing a problem that remains unresolved in most Cosserat solids generalised {continua} theories. Interestingly, the Love waves does not need the artificial introduction of a surface layer.
