## 0. Constraining all possible Korteweg-de Vries type hierarchies

**Authors:** Lukas W. Lindwasser

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18451v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18451v1)

**Summary:**

The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. We find general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. In so doing, we find constraints on all possible integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type. For example, we show that $j=\partial_-\phi$ is a Lie algebra.

## 1. Quadratic solitons in higher-order topological insulators

**Authors:** Yaroslav V. Kartashov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18432v1)

**Summary:**

I consider higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) created in chi(2) nonlinear medium. The presence of phase mismatch between parametrically interacting fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves drastically affects the bifurcation scenarios. Because the waveguides are two-mode for SH wave, its spectrum features two groups of forbidden gaps with corner states of different symmetry appearing in each of them. Such corner states give rise to different families of corner solitons.

**Authors:** Jens Hoppe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18422v1)

**Summary:**

Quantization of a cubic minimal surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is considered. Equations describing a parabolic discrete minimal surface are also considered. This leads to interesting quantum mechanical systems to be related to the quantization of the minimal surface.

## 3. Trotter error and gate complexity of the SYK and sparse SYK models

**Authors:** Yiyuan Chen, Jonas Helsen, Maris Ozols

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18420v1)

**Summary:**

The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a prominent model of strongly interacting fermions that serves as a toy model of quantum gravity and black hole physics. In this work, we study the Trotter error and gate complexity of the quantum simulation of the SYK model using Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formulas. These gate complexities can be further improved when simulating the time-evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle.

## 4. Split Two-Periodic Aztec Diamond

**Authors:** Meredith Shea

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18349v1)

**Summary:**

Recent advancements have been made to understand the statistics of the Aztec diamond dimer model under general periodic weights. In this work we define a model that breaks periodicity in one direction by combining two different two-periodic weightings. We prove that the local asymptotics of the model agree with the typical two- Periodic model in the highest order, however the sub-leading order terms are affected. We compute the correlation kernel for this AztecDiamondDimer model by extending the methods developed by Berggren and Duits (2019)

## 5. A microlocal pathway to spectral asymmetry: curl and the eta invariant

**Authors:** Matteo Capoferri, Dmitri Vassiliev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18307v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that the eta invariant can equivalently be obtained as the trace of the difference of positive and negative spectral projections, appropriately regularised. Our construction is direct, in the sense that it does not involve analytic continuation, and is based on the use of pseudodifferential techniques. This provides a novel approach to the study of spectral asymmetry of non-semibounded (pseudo)differential systems on manifolds. It encompasses and extends previous results and provides a new way of looking at spectral asymmetric systems.

## 6. Quantization of the Momentum Map via $\frak{g}$-adapted Formalities

**Authors:** Chiara Esposito, Ryszard Nest, Jonas Schnitzer, Boris Tsygan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18295v1)

**Summary:**

In this note, we provide a proof of the existence and complete classification of $G$-invariant star products with quantum momentum maps on Poisson manifolds. We prove this by means of an equivariant version of the formality theorem. The proof is based on the theory of quantum momentum in a Poisson manifold. We conclude that the classification of star products can be shown to be complete and that the star products are all Poisson magnets with quantum momentum.

## 7. Controllability and Displacement Analysis of a Three-Link Elastic   Microswimmer: A Geometric Control Approach

**Authors:** Rossella Attanasi, Marta Zoppello, Gaetano Napoli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18286v1)

**Summary:**

Study investigates the dynamics and controllability of a Purcell three-link microswimmer equipped with passive elastic torsional coils at its joints. By controlling the spontaneous curvature, we analyse the swimmers motion using both linear and weakly nonlinear approaches. Linear analysis reveals steady harmonic solutions for small-amplitude controls but does not predict any net displacement. Weakly non linear analysis predicts translation along the orientation of the central link. These findings indicate that oscillatory controls can enable motion in all directions near equilibrium.

## 8. Thermal origin of the attractor-to-general-relativity in scalar-tensor   gravity

**Authors:** Valerio Faraoni, Andrea Giusti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18272v1)

**Summary:**

The convergence of scalar-tensor gravity to general relativity, or the departure from it, are described in a new analogy with heat dissipation in a viscous fluid. This new thermal picture is applied to cosmology, shedding light on whether gravity deviates from general relativity early on and approaches it later in the cosmic history. It also sheds light on how gravity could have evolved in the universe's early history, such as the formation of the universe as we know it. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 9. An improved upper bound for the Froude number of irrotational solitary   water waves

**Authors:** Evgeniy Lokharu, Jörg Weber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18181v1)

**Summary:**

A classical and central problem in the theory of water waves is to classify parameter regimes for which nontrivial solitary waves exist. In the two-dimensional, irrotational, pure gravity case, the Froude number $Fr$ plays a central role. In this paper, we develop a new strategy utilizing the flow force function and rigorously establish the improved upper bound $Fr < 1.37838$. We conclude that the upper bound is related to the existence of subharmonic bifurcations of Stokes waves.

## 10. Symplectic (Non-)Invariance of the Free Energy in Topological Recursion

**Authors:** Alexander Hock

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18115v1)

**Summary:**

Let $F_g$ be the free energy derived from Topological Recursion for a given spectral curve on a compact Riemann surface. $x$-$y$ duality within the theory of (Logarithmic) Topologicalrecursion is nonzero. The free energy is not generally invariant under the swap of $x $ and $y$ However, a new formula for this difference for all $g\geq 2$ can be derived. The derived formulas are particularly useful for spectral curves with a trivial $x-$Y$ dual side. In such cases, one obtains an explicit result for $F _g^\vee$.

## 11. Emergence of Lorentz symmetry from an almost-commutative twisted   spectral triple

**Authors:** Gaston Nieuviarts

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18105v1)

**Summary:**

This article demonstrates how the transition from a twisted spectral triple to a pseudo-Riemannian spectral triple arises within an almost-commutative spectral triple. This suggests that the noncommutatives part itself is responsible for the signature change. This opens a new perspective on the signature problem, suggesting that the almost-Commutative structure could be the origin of the emergence of a Lorentzian spectral trio. The article is based on a paper published in the Journal of Physics.

## 12. Real twistings are 2-line bundles

**Authors:** Tim Lüders, Lynn Otto, Konrad Waldorf

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18102v1)

**Summary:**

We construct and study a bicategory of super 2-line bundles over graded Lie groupoids. This provides a unified framework for geometric models of twistings of (Real) K-theory. The core of our work is to exhibit a wide range of models from the literature as special cases. Among them are variants of bundle gerbes (Real/equivariant/Jandl), Freed-Moore's twisted groupoid extensions, Freed-Hopkins-Teleman's K- theory twistings, Moutuou's Real twistings.

## 13. Stability of oscillations in the spatially extended May-Leonard model

**Authors:** Idan Sorin, Alexander Nepomnyashchy, Vladimir Volpert

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18048v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18048v1)

**Summary:**

The May-Leonard model for three competing species is considered. Exact time-periodic solutions of the system have been found. The stability of solu tions with respect to longwave spatial modulations is revealed. A period doubling   instability breaking the spatial uniformity is found. It is the first study of its kind to look at the system from the perspective of a time-series perspective. The study was published in the journal of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS)

## 14. Weyl Quantization of Exponential Lie Groups for Square Integrable   Representations

**Authors:** Stine Marie Berge, Simon Halvdansson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18034v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18034v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a general quantization procedure for square integrable functions on well-behaved connected exponential Lie groups. The Lie groups in question should admit at least one co-adjoint orbit of maximal possible dimension. The construction is based on composing the Fourier-Wigner transform with another Fourier transform. This quantization has many desirable properties including respecting function translations and inducing a well- behaved Wigner distribution. We investigate the connection to the operator convolutions of quantum harmonic analysis. This is intricately connected to Weyl quantization in the Weyl-Heisenberg setting.

## 15. Existence and Stability of Ground States for the Defocusing Nonlinear   Schrödinger Equation on Quantum Graphs

**Authors:** Élio Durand-Simonnet, Boris Shakarov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18014v1)

**Summary:**

We study the existence and stability of ground states for the defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation on non-compact metric graphs. We establish a sharp criterion for the existence of action ground states, linking it to the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian operator. For mass subcritical exponents of the nonlinearity, there exists a large interval of masses for which no energy ground state exists while in the opposite case, they exist for all masses. We prove that while every action minimizer is an energy minimizer, the converse may not hold.

## 16. A Calculus for Finite Parts and Residues of some Divergent Complex   Geometric Integrals

**Authors:** Ludvig Svensson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17991v1)

**Summary:**

We consider divergent integrals of certain forms of a complex form. The forms are singular along a subvariety defined by the zero set of a holomorphic section. Equipping $E$ with a smooth Hermitian metric allows us to define a finite part of the divergent integral as the action of a certain current extension. We introduce a current calculus to compute finite parts for a special class of $\omega$. Our main result is a formula that decomposes the finite part into sums of products of explicit currents. We show that, in principle, it is possible to reduce the computation of such an integral to a general one.

## 17. Kinetic variable-sample methods for stochastic optimization problems

**Authors:** Sabrina Bonandin, Michael Herty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17982v1)

**Summary:**

 Variable-sample strategies replace the expected value by an approximation at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. We introduce a novel variable-sample inspired time-discrete consensus-type algorithm and demonstrate its computational efficiency. We present an alternative time-continuous kinetic-based description of the algorithm, which allows us to exploit tools of kinetic theory to conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we test the consistency of the proposed modelling approaches through several numerical experiments. The paper is published by the Royal Society of London.

## 18. Multiplier modules of Hilbert C*-modules revisited

**Authors:** Michael Frank

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17959v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17959v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of multiplier modules of Hilbert C*- modules is reconsidered to obtain more properties of these special Hilbert C- modules. The property of a Hilbert C*,- module to be a multiplier C**- module is shown to be an invariant. The structures on the latter are alwas isometricall embedded into the respective structures on. the former. Examples for which continuation of these kinds of bounded module operators from the initial Hilbert C*. module to its multiplier module fails are given, however existing continuations turn out to be always unique.

## 19. Dynamical spectrum of power-free integers in quadratic number fields and   beyond

**Authors:** Michael Baake, Daniel Luz, Tanja Schindler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17736v1)

**Summary:**

Power-free integers and related lattice subsets give rise to interesting dynamical systems. They are revisited from a spectral perspective, in the setting of the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. Many of these systems have pure-point dynamical spectrum, but trivial topological point spectrum. We calculate the spectra explicitly, in additive notation, and derive their group structure, both for a large class of $\mathcal{B}$-free lattice systems in $R$ and for power-free integer in quadratic number fields.
