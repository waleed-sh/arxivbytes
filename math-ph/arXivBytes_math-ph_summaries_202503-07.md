## 0. Coarse graining and reduced order models for plume ejection dynamics

**Authors:** Ike Griss Salas, Megan R. Ebers, Jake Stevens-Haas, J. Nathan Kutz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04690v1)

**Summary:**

High-fidelity computational models are often employed to simulate plume dynamics. We address the challenge of modeling the initial plume generation. We propose a data-driven framework that identifies a reduced-order analytical model. The resulting model is a pre-cursor to standard models such as the Gaussian plume model. It has the potential to enable rapid assessment and evaluation of critical environmental hazards, such as methane leaks, chemical spills, and pollutant dispersal from smokestacks.

## 1. A New Proof of the QNEC

**Authors:** Stefan Hollands, Roberto Longo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04651v1)

**Summary:**

We give a simplified proof of the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) Our proof is based on an explicit formula for the shape derivative of the relative entropy, with respect to an entangling cut. It allows bypassing the analytic continuation arguments of a previous proof by Ceyhan and Faulkner. It can be used e.g., for defining entropy current fluctuations. For more information on the QNEC, visit the Quantum Null Energy Condition Wikipedia page and the Quantum Entanglement Wikipedia page.

## 2. Algebra of Invariants for the Vlasov-Maxwell System

**Authors:** Philip J. Morrison

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04608v1)

**Summary:**

Invariants and their associated fluxes are obtained directly from the Vlasov-Maxwell system. Invariants are shown to Poisson commute with the Hamiltonian. Special attention is given to the role played by the monopole condition, $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}$. The algebra of invariants for both the relativistic and nonrelativistic multispecies system is examined. The rest of the Poisson bracket algebra of invariants is identified.

## 3. Monotonicities of Tanaka-Nakayama flows

**Authors:** Ken Kikuchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04587v1)

**Summary:**

We prove conformal and global dimensions monotonically decrease under the infinitely many Tanaka-Nakayama renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models. The flows also satisfy the half-integer condition. We also prove that the flows between the two models satisfy the half-integer condition. We conclude by showing that the conformal and global dimensions of the models decrease under these flows. We call this result the "Virasoro-Rinormalization Group Theory"

## 4. Presymplectic BV-AKSZ for $N=1$ $D=4$ Supergravity

**Authors:** Maxim Grigoriev, Alexander Mamekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach to supersymmetric systems. We construct such a formulation for the $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity by taking as a target space the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the super-Poincar\'e algebra. In particular, we demonstrate that this data encodes a full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system. The analogous considerations apply to supergravity and its uplift to superspace.

## 5. Reinforced Loop Soup via Wilson's Algorithm

**Authors:** Yinshan Chang, Yichao Huang, Dang-Zheng Liu, Xiaolin Zeng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04503v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04503v1)

**Summary:**

The goal of this note is twofold: first, we explain the relation between the isomorphism theorems in the context of the reinforced jump process discovered in [BHS19, BHS21] and the standard Markovian isomorphisms for Markovians. Second, we introduce the vertex reinforced counterpart of the standard Poissonian loop soup developed by Le Jan [LJ10]. To this end, we propose an algorithm that can be viewed as a variant of Wilson's algorithm with reinforcement.

## 6. A new Lagrangian approach to optimal control of second-order systems

**Authors:** Michael Konopik, Sigrid Leyendecker, Sofya Maslovskaya, Sina Ober-Blöbaum, Rodrigo T. Sato Martín de Almagro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04466v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04466v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we propose and study a new approach to formulate the optimal control problem of second-order differential equations. The formulation results in a new hyperregular control Langrangian and, thus, a new control Hamiltonian. We compare this approach to Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) in this setting, providing geometric insight into their relation. This leads us to define an extended Tulczyjew's triple with controls. And we study the relationship between Noether symmetries of this new formulation and those of the PMP.

## 7. Polynomial algebra from the Lie algebra reduction chain   $\mathfrak{su}(4) \supset \mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)$: The   supermultiplet model

**Authors:** Rutwig Campoamor-Stursberg, Danilo Latini, Ian Marquette, Junze Zhang, Yao-Zhong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04108v1)

**Summary:**

The study is conducted in the Poisson (commutative) framework using the Lie-Poisson bracket associated with the dual of the Lie algebra under consideration. We obtain the polynomial Poisson algebra generated by these twenty linearly independent and indecomposable polynomials, with five elements being central. These findings represent a further step toward the systematic exploration of polynometric algebras relevant to nuclear models. We also show that the recently introduced 'grading method' turns out to be essential for deriving Poisson bracket relations when the degree of the expansions becomes so high.

## 8. Gradient-enhanced PINN with residual unit for studying forward-inverse   problems of variable coefficient equations

**Authors:** Hui-Juan Zhou, Yong Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04056v1)

**Summary:**

 Physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a powerful emerging method for studying forward-inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) Variable coefficient PDEs, which model real-world phenomena, are of considerable physical significance and research value. This study proposes a gradient-enhanced PINN with residual unit (R-g PINN) method to solve the data-driven solution and function discovery for variable coefficient PMEs. The results show that using R-gPINN method can greatly improve the accuracy of predict solution and predict variable coefficient in solving variable coefficient equations.

## 9. Geometric properties and offset surface construction for slant   timelike-ruled surfaces

**Authors:** Areej A. Almoneef, Rashad A. Abdel-baky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04026v1)

**Summary:**

This work investigates slant timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Minkowski 3-space. The geometric properties are examined through the Blaschke and Darboux frames, leading to curvature characteristics and fundamental invariants. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the differential geometry of timeliked-r ruled surfaces in Lorentzian space. The findings are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, San Diego.

## 10. Uniform Boundedness of Homogeneous Incompressible Flows in   $\mathbb{R}^3$

**Authors:** Ulisse Iotti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03991v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the extendability of local solutions for incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes and 3D Euler problems. Initial data is in the Sobolev space $H^s (\mathbb{R}^3)$, where $s$ ensures the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions. A geometric decomposition of the configuration space splits the problem into two simpler subproblems, which enable the uniform boundedness of the solution in each component of the partition.
