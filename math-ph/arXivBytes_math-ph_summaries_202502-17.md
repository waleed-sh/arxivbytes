## 0. Scaling limit and tail bounds for a random walk model of SOS level lines

**Authors:** Milind Hegde, Yujin H. Kim, Christian Serio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10384v1)

**Summary:**

This paper analyzes a random walk model for the level lines appearing in the entropic repulsion phenomena of three-dimensional discrete random interfaces above a hard wall. We are particularly motivated by the low-temperature (2+1)D solid-on-solid (SOS) model, where the emergence of these level lines has been rigorously established. The model we consider is a line ensemble of non-crossing random walk bridges above a wall with geometrically growing area tilts.

## 1. Generalised Process Theories

**Authors:** John H. Selby, Maria E. Stasinou, Matt Wilson, Bob Coecke

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10368v1)

**Summary:**

Process theories provide a powerful framework for describing compositional structures across diverse fields. Traditionally, they have been formalized using symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) However, various generalizations, including time-neutral, higher-order, and enriched process theories, do not naturally conform to this structure. In this work, we propose an alternative formalization using operad algebras, motivated by recent results connecting SMCs to operadic structures. By leveraging the string-diagrammatic language, we provide an accessible yet rigorous formulation.

## 2. Non-Null Torus Knotted Gravitational Waves from Gravitoelectromagnetism

**Authors:** R. S. Facundo, I. V. Vancea

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10347v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we construct a non-null torus-knotted gravitational monochromatic wave solution of the linearized Einstein equations in vacuum. We employ the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) framework by analogy with classical electrodynamics. We investigate two properties inherent to this solution due to its GEM origin: the dual GEM potential and GEM helicity. We derive the line element, the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor and the geodesic equation for this background.

## 3. Stretching theory of Hookean metashells

**Authors:** Luca Giomi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10345v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10345v1)

**Summary:**

 elastic shells patterned with an internal structure (i.e. metashells) exhibit a wealth of unusual mechanical properties with no counterparts in unstructured materials. Here I show that much of this behavior can be captured by a real-valued analog of the inhomogeneous Schrodinger equation. When applied to crystalline monolayers, this approach provides a generalization of the elastic theory of interacting topological defect to compressible systems. In the fine structure limit $-$ this approach reveals the existence of localized states, in which elastic deformations are prevented to diffuse.

## 4. Operator level soft edge to bulk transition in $β$-ensembles via   canonical systems

**Authors:** Vincent Painchaud, Elliot Paquette

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10305v1)

**Summary:**

Stochastic Airy and sine operators characterize the soft edge and bulk scaling limits of $\beta$-ensembles. Dirac and Sturm-Liouville operators are distinct operator classes which can both be represented as canonical systems. We prove that in a suitable high-energy scaling limit, the Airy operator converges to the sine operator. We deduce the convergence of the associated Weyl-Titchmarsh functions and spectral measures, under which the convergence holds in probability.

## 5. On alleged solutions of the cubically nonlinear Schrödinger equation

**Authors:** Hans Werner Schuermann, Valery Serov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10234v1)

**Summary:**

We present a numerical example that indicates inconsistency of a widely used ansatz with cubically nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. On the basis of analytical results, we present an example of the inconsistency of an ansatz and an equation. We conclude that the ansatz is not consistent with the equation, and that it should be replaced by a different ansatz that is not inconsistent with the Schr \"odinger equation. The example is based on the results of an analysis of a number of variables.

## 6. Spectral Instability of Random Fredholm Operators

**Authors:** Simon Becker, Izak Oltman, Martin Vogel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10222v1)

**Summary:**

If $A \colon D(A) is an unbounded Fredholm operator of index $0$ on a Hilbert space, then its spectrum is either discrete or the entire complex plane. This paper proves that if such operators are perturbed by certain random trace-class operators, their spectrum is discrete with high probability. This spectral dichotomy plays a central role in the study of \textit{magic angles} in twisted bilayer graphene. The paper was published in the journal Applied Mathematics.

## 7. Higher Schwarzian, quasimodular forms and equivariant functions

**Authors:** Hicham Saber, Abdellah Sebbar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10176v1)

**Summary:**

Schwarzian derivative plays a fundamental role in complex analysis, differential equations, and modular forms. We prove that a meromorphic function is equivariant if and only if its higher Schwarzians are quasimodular forms of prescribed weight and depth. We thereby extend classical results and linking projective differential operators to the structure of modular and quasicommodular forms. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.. The Schwarzian derivative is an integral part of complex analysis and differential equations.

## 8. Complex degenerate metrics in general relativity: a covariant extension   of the Moore-Penrose algorithm

**Authors:** Arthur Garnier, Emmanuele Battista

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10053v1)

**Summary:**

The Moore-Penrose algorithm provides a generalized notion of an inverse. Remarkably, the degenerate nature of the metric can be given a geometrical representation in terms of a torsion tensor. Applications of the new scheme to complex black hole geometries and cosmological models are also investigated. Relevance of our findings to quantum gravity and quantum cosmology is finally discussed.

## 9. Intermittency and Dissipation Regularity in Turbulence

**Authors:** Luigi De Rosa, Theodore D. Drivas, Marco Inversi, Philip Isett

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10032v1)

**Summary:**

We lay down a geometric-analytic framework to capture properties of energy dissipation within weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations. For solutions with spatial Besov regularity, it is proved that the Duchon-Robert distribution has improved regularity in a negative Besov space. This imposes quantitative constraints on the dimension of the, possibly fractal, dissipative set and the admissible structure functions exponents. As a by-product of the approach, we also recover many known "Onsager singularity" type results.

## 10. Mixing rate exponent of planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn percolation

**Authors:** Haoyu Liu, Baojun Wu, Zijie Zhuang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09950v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09950v1)

**Summary:**

Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022) recently proved the scaling relations for planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolation. In this paper, we define the CLE analog of the mixing rate exponent. The derivation of the CLE exponent is based on an exact formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative between the marginal laws of the odd-level and even-level CLE loops, which is obtained from the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and CLE.

## 11. Rigorous lower bound of the dynamical critical exponent of the Ising   model

**Authors:** Rintaro Masaoka, Tomohiro Soejima, Haruki Watanabe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09908v1)

**Summary:**

The best known bound of the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the $d$-dimensional kinetic Ising model is $z\geq 2-\eta$. We rigorously improve this bound to $z \geq2$. We also improve the bound on the critical exponent of the model to be $z 2-2-2. We call this the "Ising bound" for the kinetic model. We conclude that the Ising bound is now $z 1-1-1.
