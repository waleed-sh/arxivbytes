## 0. Koopman analysis of CAT maps onto classical and quantum 2-tori

**Authors:** David Viennot

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10293v1)

**Summary:**

We study classical continuous automorphisms of the torus (CAT maps) from the viewpoint of the Koopman theory. The spectrum of the operator is studied in four cases of CAT maps: cyclic, quasi-cyclic, critical and chaotic. We generalise these results to quantum CAT maps defined onto a noncommutative torus and on its dual space. We study usual quantum chaos indicators onto quantum CAT Maps from the viewpoints of theKoopman picture. The analogy with the classical case suggests that couples of these indicators are in fact necessary to certify a quantum chaotic behaviour.

## 1. Gauge transformations on quantum principal bundles

**Authors:** Antonio Del Donno, Emanuele Latini, Thomas Weber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10193v1)

**Summary:**

We understand quantum principal bundle as faithfully flat Hopf--Galois extensions, with a structure Hopf algebra coacting on a total space algebra. To endow such bundles with a compatible differential structure, one requires the coaction to extend as a morphism of differential graded algebras. Explicit examples, such as the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and smash product algebraes are discussed. We recall this approach to noncommUTative differential geometry and further discuss the extension of quantum gauge transformations, in the sense of Brzezi\'nski, to differential forms.

## 2. Multiple phase estimation with photon-added multi-mode coherent states   of GHZ-type

**Authors:** Hanan Saidi, Abdallah Slaoui, Hanane El Hadfi, Rachid Ahl Laamara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10161v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10161v1)

**Summary:**

This paper explores multiparameter quantum metrology using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-type photon-added coherent states (PACS) It investigates both independent and simultaneous parameter estimation with linear and non-linear protocols. Our results show that simultaneous estimation generally outperforms independent estimation, particularly in non- linear protocols. We also compare PACS-based GHZ states with NOON states and entangled coherent states, demonstrating the relative performance of each. And we conclude with an analysis of homodyne detection in the context of a linear protocol, discussing its impact on estimation accuracy.

## 3. Remarks on Landau damping

**Authors:** Toan T. Nguyen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10058v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10058v1)

**Summary:**

We provide few remarks on nonlinear Landau damping that concerns decay of the electric field in the classical Vlasov-Poisson system near spatially homogenous equilibria. In particular, this includes the analyticity framework, \`a la Grenier-Nguyen-Rodnianski, for non specialists. We treat the analytic case studied by Mouhot-Villani, among other remarks for plasmas confined on a torus and in the whole space.

## 4. Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix   identities

**Authors:** D. Domanevsky, A. Zotov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918v1)

**Summary:**

We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau and Lifshitz equations. We conclude that the family of models can be used to solve the equations of motion.

## 5. A Topological and Operator Algebraic Framework for Asynchronous Lattice   Dynamical Systems

**Authors:** Faruk Alpay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09898v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09898v1)

**Summary:**

The paper uses topological dynamics, operator algebras, and ergodic geometry to study lattices of asynchronous metric dynamical systems. Each node in the lattice carries an internal flow represented by a one-parameter family of operators, evolving on its own time scale. The main results include: the existence and uniqueness of coherent (synchronized) states under a contractive coupling condition, stability of these coherent states and criteria for their emergence as a collective phase transition in a continuous operator topology.

## 6. Background fields in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach

**Authors:** Ivan Dneprov, Maxim Grigoriev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885v1)

**Summary:**

Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDE's whose base spaces are again gaugePDEs describing background fields, as such the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle.

## 7. Finite size corrections in the bulk for circular $Î²$ ensembles

**Authors:** Peter J. Forrester, Bo-Jian Shen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09865v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09865v1)

**Summary:**

The statistical state of the eigenvalues is then a determinantal point process ($\beta = 2$) and Pfaffian point process. The explicit functional forms of the correlation kernels then imply that the general $n$-point correlation functions exhibit an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$ for the spacing distributions and their generating function. We use $\sigma$-Painlev\'e characterisations to show that the functional form of the first correction is related to the leading term via a second derivative.
