## 0. Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network   motifs

**Authors:** Vincent Thibeault, Benjamin Claveau, Antoine Allard, Patrick Desrosiers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06248v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06248v1)

**Summary:**

The Kuramoto model is often thought to be restricted to identically connected oscillators or groups thereof. Yet, the exact connectivity prerequisites for having constants of motion on more general graphs have remained elusive. Using spectral properties of the Koopman generator, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions. This reveals a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities. Furthermore, we identify Lie symmetries that generate new Constant of motion. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical application of Koop man's framework to nonlinear dynamics on complex networks.

## 1. Up-to-constants estimates on four-arm events for simple conformal loop   ensemble

**Authors:** Yifan Gao, Pierre Nolin, Wei Qian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06202v1)

**Summary:**

The four-arm events that we consider can be created by either one or two loops, with no constraint on the topology of the crossings. We rely on the Brownian loop-soup representation of simple CLE [Ann. Math. 176 (2012) 1827-1917] and a "cluster version" of a separation lemma. Our result is a key input in our series of works on percolation of the two-sided level sets in the discrete Gaussian free field.

## 2. Orthogonal polynomials with complex densities and quantum minimal   surfaces

**Authors:** Giovanni Felder, Jens Hoppe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06197v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the discrete Painlev\'e-type equations arising from quantum minimal surfaces are equations for recurrence coefficients of orthogonal polynomials for indefinite hermitian products. As a consequence we obtain an explicit formula for the initial conditions leading to positive solutions. We also show that there is an explicit equation for the initially positive conditions leading to the solution of the equations. We conclude that the equations can be expressed as the equations of a quantum minimal surface.

## 3. Singularity and regularity of the critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow

**Authors:** Francesco Caravenna, Rongfeng Sun, Nikos Zygouras

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06128v1)

**Summary:**

The Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) provides a natural candidate solution to the ill-posed 2D Heat Equation with multiplicative space-time white noise. We prove that, as a random measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is a. singular w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. We also describe the regularity of the SHF, showing that it is. a.s. H\"older $C^{-\epsilon}$ for any $C>0$, implying the absence of atoms.

## 4. On the structure of DHR bimodules of abstract spin chains

**Authors:** Lucas Hataishi, David Jaklitsch, Corey Jones, Makoto Yamashita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06094v1)

**Summary:**

 abstract spin chains axiomatize the structure of local observables on the 1D lattice. They are invariant under a global symmetry, and arise at the physical boundary of 2+1D topologically ordered spin systems. In this paper, we study tensor categorical properties of DHR bimodules over spin chains. We prove that the associated category has a structure of modular tensor category with respect to the natural braiding. Under an additional assumption of algebraic Haag duality, this category becomes the Drinfeld center of the half-line fusion category.

## 5. NQG III -- Two-Centre Problems, Whirlpool Galaxy and Toy Neutron Stars

**Authors:** Richard Durran, Aubrey Truman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06030v1)

**Summary:**

In the hunt for WIMPish dark matter and testing our new theory, we extend the results obtained for the Kepler problem. In the first case our results lead to quantum elliptical spirals converging to elliptical orbits where stars and other celestial bodies can form. The examples inevitably involve elliptic integrals as was the case in our earlier work on equatorial orbits of toy neutron stars. At the end of the paper we see how the Burgers-Zeldovich fluid model relates to our set-up through Nelson's stochastic mechanics.

## 6. A Lorentz Covariant Matrix Model for Bosonic M2-Branes: Nambu Brackets   and Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations

**Authors:** So Katagiri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05940v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05940v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a Lorentz covariant matrix model as a nonperturbative formulation of the bosonic M2-brane in M-theory. Unlike previous approaches relying on the light-cone gauge or symmetry-based constructions, our model retains full 11-dimensional LorentZ invariance. The resulting model exhibits RVPD symmetry, admits particle-like and noncommutative membrane solutions, and lays the foundation for a Lorenntz-invariant matrix description of M1-branes.

## 7. Notes on color reductions and $γ$ traces

**Authors:** Oliver Schnetz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05853v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05853v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of these notes is to give a self-contained, proved account of the basic results with particular emphasis on color reductions. We fine tune existing algorithms to make calculations at high loop orders possible. We present efficient algorithms to calculate the color factors for the $SU(N)$ gauge group and to evaluate $\gamma$ traces. We show how to use these algorithms to create color-reductions for the gauge group. We also show how these algorithms can be used to calculate color reductions for gauge groups.

## 8. Graphical functions with spin

**Authors:** Oliver Schnetz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05850v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05850v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of graphical functions is generalized from scalar theories to theories with spin, leading to a numerator structure in Feynman integrals. The main part of this article treats the case of positive integer spin, which is obtained from spin $1/2$ theories after the evaluation of $\gamma$ traces. As an application, we calculateFeynman periods in Yukawa-$\phi^4$ (Gross-Neveu-Yukawa) theory up to loop order eight.

## 9. Solitons of the constrained Schrödinger equations

**Authors:** V. E. Vekslerchik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05816v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the linear vector Schr\"odinger equation subjected to quadratic constraints. We demonstrate that the resulting nonlinear system is closely related to the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy. We use this fact to derive the N-soliton solutions for the discussed model. We conclude with the conclusion that the model can be viewed as a non-linear system with an N-Soliton solution for the Schrodinger equations. The model can then be used to solve for other non-Linear equations.

## 10. Fractional Time-Delayed differential equations: Applications in   Cosmological Studies

**Authors:** Bayron Micolta-Riascos, Byron Droguett, Gisel Mattar Marriaga, Genly Leon, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Luis del Campo, Yoelsy Leyva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05705v1)

**Summary:**

Fractional differential equations model processes with memory effects, providing a realistic perspective on complex systems. We examine first-order and fractional Caputo time-delayed differential equations. We then solve this equation analytically. Due to the complexity of the analytical solution, we also provide a numerical representation. Our solution reaches the de Sitter equilibrium point. Additionally, we present some generalizations to Caputo's time-Delayed fractional differential equation. This equation accounts for the finite response times of cosmic fluids, resulting in a comprehensive model of the Universe's behavior.

## 11. Natural Theories

**Authors:** James Owen Weatherall, Eleanor March

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05703v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05703v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the class of physical theories whose dynamics are given by natural equations. Natural equations are partial differential equations determined by a functor. We show how the theory of natural equations clarifies several important foundational issues. We also state and prove a fundamental result about the initial value problem for natural equations, for some n.

## 12. Contraction and concentration of measures with applications to   theoretical neuroscience

**Authors:** Simone Betteti, Francesco Bullo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05666v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the asymptotic behavior of probability measures associated with stochastic dynamical systems. While classical results often assume constant diffusion and gradient-based drifts, we extend the analysis to spatially inhomogeneous diffusion and non-integrable vector fields. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of stationary measures under global contraction. The theoretical findings are illustrated through Hopfield networks, highlighting implications for memory retrieval dynamics in noisy environments. We demonstrate mass concentration near the minima of an associated non-convex potential, like in multistable regimes.

## 13. Integrability of Combinatorial Riemann Boundary Value Problem and   Lattice Walk Avoiding a Quadrant

**Authors:** Ruijie Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05659v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a general framework of matrix-form combinatorial Riemann boundary value problem (cRBVP) to characterize the integrability of functional equations arising in lattice walk enumeration. A matrix cRBVP is defined as integrable if it can be reduced to enough polynomial equations with one catalytic variable. Crucially, our framework generalizes three-quadrant walks with Weyl symmetry to models satisfying only orbit-sum conditions. It explains many criteria about the orbit-Sum proposed by various researchers and also works for walks starting outside the quadrant.

## 14. Remarks on the locality of generalized global symmetries

**Authors:** Owen Gwilliam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05626v1)

**Summary:**

We examine generalized global symmetries as a kind of compactly supported cohomology. Physics naturally suggests a generalization of factorization algebras aimed at capturing nonperturbative information. We explain how higher group symmetry offer examples of this generalization. We explore how continuous generalized symmetry and anomalies can be cast in this framework. We conclude with an extension of the nonabelian Poincar\'e duality of Salvatore and Lurie to quantum field theory.
