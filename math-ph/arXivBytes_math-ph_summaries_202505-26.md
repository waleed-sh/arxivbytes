## 0. Surface-Encoded Partial Coherence Transformation: Modeling Source   Coherence Effects in Wave Optics

**Authors:** Netzer Moriya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17754v1)

**Summary:**

We present a new mathematical framework for incorporating partial coherence effects into wave optics simulations. We use a comprehensive surface-to-detector approach. The method reduces the dimensional complexity of coherence calculations. It offers potential computational advantages, particularly for systems involving multiple surfaces and propagation steps. Applications include optical testing and astronomical instrumentation. We derive the mathematical foundation based on the coherence function formalism, establish the connection to the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem, and prove the equivalence of our framework to conventional Partial Coherence Theory.

## 1. One dimensional inverse problem in photoacoustic. Numerical testing

**Authors:** D. Langemann, A. S. Mikhaylov, V. S. Mikhaylov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17680v1)

**Summary:**

This is a model for the multidimensional problem of photoacoustics. We adapt and simplify the method for one-dimensional situation. We provide the results on numerical testing to see the rate of convergence and stability of the procedure. We also give some hints on how the procedure of reconstruction can be simplified in 2d and 3d cases. We consider the problem of reconstruction of Cauchy data for the wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^1$ by the measurements of its solution on the boundary of the finite interval.

## 2. Kostka Numbers Constrain Particle Exchange Statistics beyond Fermions   and Bosons

**Authors:** Chi-Chun Zhou, Yu-Zhu Chen, Shuai A. Chen, Yao Shen, Fu-Lin Zhang, Wu-Sheng Dai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17361v1)

**Summary:**

We establish the microstate uniqueness theorem (MUT) using combinatorial arguments with Kostka numbers. The MUT relies solely on the indistinguishability principle, without invoking Lorentz symmetry or any field-theoretic assumptions. intermediate statistics based on higher-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetric group or on modified microstate-counting rules are mathematically ruled out for indistinguishable particles, we say. We conclude that the MUT proves that statistical-mechanics counting constraints (route 1) and symmetric-group-based quantum-Mechanical exchange symmetry (route 2) are incompatible.
