## 0. The $q$-Racah polynomials from scalar products of Bethe states II

**Authors:** Pascal Baseilhac, Rodrigo A. Pimenta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10310v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of Leonard triples is applied to the derivation of normalized scalar products of on-shell and off-shell Bethe states generated from a Leonard pair. It implies the existence of a determinant formula in terms of inhomogeneous Bethe roots for the $q$-Racah polynomials. Also, a set of relations that determines solutions (Bethe roots) of the corresponding Bethe equations of homogenous type is obtained. The results are used to solve Belliard-Slavnov linear systems.

## 1. On Explicit Estimations for the Bloch Eigenvalues of the One-dimensional   Schrödinger Operator and the Kronig-Penney Model

**Authors:** Cemile Nur, Oktay Veliev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10225v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we consider the small and large eigenvalues of the one-dimensional Schrodinger operator L(q) with a periodic, real and locally integrable potential q. First we explicitly write out the first and second terms of the asymptotic formulas for the large periodic and antiperiodic eigen Values. Then we give estimates for the small periodic andAntiperiodic Eigenvalues and for the length of the first gaps in the case of the Kronig-Penney model.

## 2. Quantum tomography from the evolution of a single expectation

**Authors:** Hjalmar Rall, Michael M. Wolf

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10118v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10118v1)

**Summary:**

Every non-trivial binary measurement evolved by any quantum channel, except for a null set, in principle enables full quantum state tomography. We show that beyond the qubit case unitary evolution is never sufficient - so the presence of noise is essential. We prove an analog of Takens' embedding theorem for quantum channels, which extends our findings to cases where prior information is available. We provide estimation bounds for finite statistics and we provide an estimate of the time evolution of a single expectation value.

## 3. A state sum for four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum geometry in terms of   edge vectors

**Authors:** Roukaya Dekhil, Matteo Laudonio, Daniele Oriti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115v1)

**Summary:**

We present the construction of a new state sum model for $4d$ Lorentzian quantum gravity. It is based on the description of quantum simplicial geometry in terms of edge vectors. We also show how the new model connects to the LorentZian Barrett-Crane spin foam model, formulated in terms. of quantized triangle bivectors. Back to Mail Online home.back to the page you came from.

## 4. Stability of the $π$-Flux Phase for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Lattice Gauge   Theory Coupled to Fermionic Matter

**Authors:** Leonardo Goller, Marcello Porta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10065v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the two-dimensional Ising gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter. In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient. We compute the magnetic susceptibility and prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions.

## 5. A Proof of Lieb--Wehrl Entropy conjecture for $SU(N,1)$

**Authors:** Pratyoosh Kumar, Mandeep Singh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10061v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the sharp functional inequalities for the coherent state transforms of $SU(N,1)$. These inequalities are rooted in Wehrl's definition of semiclassical entropy and his conjecture about its minimum value. The generalized Lieb conjecture has been resolved for several Lie groups. We explore the Faber-Krahn inequality, which applies to the short-time Fourier transform with a Gaussian window. This inequality was previously proven by Nicola and Tilli and later extended to the wavelet transform.

## 6. Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond   field

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi, Ali Övgün

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat. We perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge.
