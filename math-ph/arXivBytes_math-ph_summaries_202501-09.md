## 0. Monotonicity of the Relative Entropy and the Two-sided Bogoliubov   Inequality in von Neumann Algebras

**Authors:** Benedikt M. Reible

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04564v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04564v1)

**Summary:**

This text studies certain monotonicity properties of the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy and unbounded perturbation theory of KMS-states. It also provides a proof of the two-sided Bogoliubov inequality in general von Neumann algebras. This mathematical apparatus will then be used to extend the relative free energy inequality for the arbitrary algebr as well as for quantum-mechanical systems. The text is written in the framework of Derezi\'{n}ski-Jak\v{s}i\'{c}-Pillet.

## 1. Reduction by stages for affine W-algebras

**Authors:** Naoki Genra, Thibault Juillard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04501v1)

**Summary:**

Given a pair of nilpotent orbits in a simple Lie algebra, one can associate them with affine W-algebras. Under some compatibility conditions on these orbits, we prove that one of these W- algebraes can be obtained as the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the other. This property is called reduction by stages. We provide several examples in classical and exceptional types. We also prove and use the fact that each W-Algebra can be defined using several equivalent BRST cohomology constructions. choosing the right BRST complexes allows us to connect the two W-alebras in a natural way.

## 2. Categories of orthosets and adjointable maps

**Authors:** Jan Paseka, Thomas Vetterlein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04482v1)

**Summary:**

An orthoset is a non-empty set together with a symmetric and irreflexive binary relation. We say that a map $f \colon X \to Y$ between orthosets with 0 possesses the adjoint $g \ colon Y \to X$ We call $f$ in this case adjointable. For instance, any bounded linear map between Hilbert spaces induces a map with this property. We especially focus on the full subcategory iOS of irredundant orthos sets with 0.

## 3. Time-asymptotic stability of generic Riemann solutions for Boltzmann   equation

**Authors:** Yi Wang, Qiuyang Yu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04399v1)

**Summary:**

Time-asymptotic stability of generic Riemann solution, consisting of a rarefaction wave, a contact discontinuity and a shock, for the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation, has been a long-standing open problem in kinetic theory. Compared with the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, the new difficulties here lie in the microscopic effects of the Boltzman shock profile and their interactions and/or couplings with the raref action wave, viscous contact wave and the macroscopic components.
