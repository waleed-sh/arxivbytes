## 0. A Modified Davey-Stewartson System of Nonlinear Dust Acoustic Waves in   (3+1)-Dimensions: Lie Symmetries and Exact Solutions

**Authors:** Seyma Gonul, Yasin Hasanoglu, Ayse Tiryakioglu, Yasemin Calis, Cihangir Ozemir

**Summary:**

This article is devoted to the analysis of a modified Davey-Stewartson system in three space dimensions. The system was obtained in plasma physics for propagation of nonlinear dust acoustic waves. We present several results on the exact solutions of generalized traveling wave type, some of which are line solitons and kink soliton on planes in space. We finalize by analysing the stability of traveling wave solutions. The results shed light on the group-theoretical properties of the system.

## 1. Kinetic Model of the Emergence of Autocatalysis

**Authors:** P. O. Mchedlov-Petrosyan, L. N. Davydov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01795v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a formal model of the emergence of self-constructing objects (e.g. heteropolymers with autocatalytic capability) in an open system. We consider such process as possibly simplest example of selforganization. We obtained exact solutions of our model for several presumed mechanisms of random change of the productivity. We have shown that the probability to find self- Constructing objects in the system necessarily increases, even if initially it was equal to zero. The system as a whole is subjected to external limitation: the total number of the objects is conserved.

## 2. Delocalization of One-Dimensional Random Band Matrices

**Authors:** Horng-Tzer Yau, Jun Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01718v1)

**Summary:**

In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results. (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varpsilon > 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L ^2 $ mass of eigenevectors becomes equidistributed with high probability.

## 3. pyBoLaNO: A Python symbolic package for normal ordering involving   bosonic ladder operators

**Authors:** Hendry M. Lim, Donny Dwiputra, M. Shoufie Ukhtary, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01603v1)

**Summary:**

 pyBoLaNO is a Python symbolic package based on SymPy. It offers the normal ordering of commutators of any two polynomials in bosonic ladder operators. It also offers the evaluation of the normal-ordered expectation value evolution in the Lindblad master equation framework for open quantum systems. We describe the package's workflow, show examples of use, and discuss its computational performance. All codes and examples are available on our GitHub repository. The package also supports multipartite descriptions and multiprocessing.
