## 0. On the existence of Nehari ground states for the Nonlinear Schrödinger   Equation on Discrete Graphs

**Authors:** Setenay Akduman, Matthias Hofmann, Sedef Karakılıç

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03552v1)

**Summary:**

We study standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a discrete graph. In this context, we show properties of the solutions, such as integrability. We discuss decay properties of solutions and the bifurcation of solutions from the trivial solution. We also study ground states on the generalized Nehari manifold in order to prove the existence of standing wave solutions in the self-focusing and defocusing case. We characterize for a self-adjoint realizations of Schr\'odinger operators conditions related with the geometry of the graph.

## 1. Hilbert-Schmidt norm estimates for fermionic reduced density matrices

**Authors:** François Louis Antoine Visconti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03488v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $k$-particle reduced density matrices of $N$-body fermionic states is bounded by $C_kN^{k/2}$, which is of the same order as that of Slater determinant states. Our estimate directly yields a lower bound on the von Neumann entropy and the 2-R\'enyi entropy of reduceddensity matrices. It also provides further insight into conjectures of Carlen-Lieb-Reuvers (2016,2018)

## 2. Modeling and computing many-body electronic properties of twisted   bilayer graphene with mechanical relaxation

**Authors:** Tianyu Kong, Alexander B. Watson, Mitchell Luskin, Kevin D. Stubbs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03479v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03479v1)

**Summary:**

We model mechanical relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. Minimizers of the resulting functional are then input into a tight-binding model of twisted bilayer graphene. We then project this model together with a Coulomb electron-electron interaction term into the single-particle model's flat moir\'e bands. We numerically compute Hartree-Fock ground states of this model, comparing the relative energies of competing many-body ground states.

## 3. Entanglement and local holography in quantum gravity

**Authors:** Gabriel Wong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03452v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03452v1)

**Summary:**

The It from Qubit paradigm proposes that gravitational spacetimes emerge from quantum entanglement. We argue that string theory provides the mechanism to define these entangled qubits in the bulk gravitating theory. This involves a local form of geometric transition, which is the stringy mechanism that underlies \emph{local} holography. We illustrate how this works in the A model topological string, and show how it works in a topologicalstring model, as well as in a non-topological string.

## 4. Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth

**Authors:** Oleksandr Gamayun, Murtaza Ali Mir, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Zoran Ristivojevic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03435v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03435v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficient that are consistent with the universal operators growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics.

## 5. Revisiting noncommutative spacetimes from the relative locality   principle

**Authors:** J. J. Relancio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03378v1)

**Summary:**

Relativistic deformed kinematics leads to a loss of the absolute locality of interactions. In this work, we present a characterization of the Poisson-Lie algebras formed by the noncommutative space-time coordinates of a multi-particle system. We show its connection with cotangent bundle geometries. The relativistic kinematic derived from these algebraes are also discussed. We conclude with a discussion of the role of relativism in the theory of particle interactions.

## 6. The Levi-Civita connection and Chern connections for cocycle   deformations of Kähler manifolds

**Authors:** Jyotishman Bhowmick, Bappa Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03340v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that complex structures, holomorphic bimodules and Chern connections can be deformed to their noncommutative counterparts under such deformations. We consider unitary cocycle deformations of covariant $\ast$-differential calculi. Our class of examples include toric deformations considered by Mesland and Rennie as well as cocycle deformations of the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi, and the toric deformation of the K\"ahler manifold. We conclude that the Levi-Civita connection on the space of one forms of the deformed calculus can be expressed as a direct sum of the Chern connections on the twisted holomorphic and the anti-holomorph bim

## 7. Stochastic ordering, attractiveness and couplings in non-conservative   particle systems

**Authors:** Raúl Gouet, F. Javier López, Gerardo Sanz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03326v1)

**Summary:**

Stochastic comparison allows for multiple arrivals, departures and non-conservative jumps of individuals between sites. This setting includes new models, when compared to the conservative case, such as metapopulation models with deaths during migrations. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the rates for the stochastic comparison of the processes and prove their equivalence with the existence of an order-preserving Markovian coupling. A salient feature of our approach lies in the presentation of the coupling in terms of solutions to network flow problems.

## 8. Mathematical physics of dilute Bose gases

**Authors:** Jan Philip Solovej

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03314v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss recent progress in the mathematical analysis of dilute Bose gases. We review results in one to three dimensions, but the focus will be on three dimensions. In all dimensions we have a two term asymptotic expansion of the ground state energy density by an expression that depends only on the scattering length of the potential. In dimension three this is the celebrated Lee-Huang-Yang formula. In dimensions two and three the dilute limit is a weakly interacting regime whereas in dimension one it is rather strongly interacting.

## 9. Decay estimates for discrete bi-Schrödinger operators on the lattice   $\mathbb{Z}$

**Authors:** Sisi Huang, Xiaohua Yao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03290v1)

**Summary:**

It is known that the discrete Laplace operator $Delta$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies the following sharp time decay estimate. However in this paper, we have showed that the bi-Laplacian $Delta^2$ on $Z$ actually exhibits the same sharp decay estimate $|t|^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ as its continuous counterpart. We also show that $V(n)$ is a real valued potential of $Z' where $H$ is the spectral projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space.

## 10. On Spinning Particles, their Partition Functions and Picture Changing   Operators

**Authors:** Eugenia Boffo, Pietro Antonio Grassi, Ondřej Hulík, Ivo Sachs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03231v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the partition function for the $N=1$ spinning particle. We show that it counts the dimension of the BRST cohomology in two- and four-dimensional target space. We find a consistent interaction as a derived bracket based on the associative product of world line fields, leading to an interacting theory of multiforms in space-time. We comment on the equivalence of the multiform theory with a Dirac fermion and identify the chiral anomaly of the latter with a Hodge anomaly.

## 11. Controllable diatomic molecular quantum thermodynamic machines

**Authors:** C. O. Edet, E. P. Inyang, P. O. Amadi, O. Abah, N. Ali

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03131v1)

**Summary:**

We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Interestingly, our system reveals different operational phases for the range of parameter regimes considered, such as a quantum heat engine. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.

## 12. An efficient numerical method for surface acoustic wave equations over   unbounded domains

**Authors:** Jianguo Huang, Likun Qiu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03130v1)

**Summary:**

 Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are widely used in modern communication equipment. SAW equations describe the critical physical processes of acoustic-electric conversion in SAW devices. It is very challenging to numerically solve such equations, since they are typically three dimensional problems defined on unbounded domains. In this paper, we first use the perfectly matched layer method to truncate the unbounded domain and then propose a finite element tearing and interconnecting algorithm for the truncated equations. We also design an effective solver for the ill-conditioned linear system of the Lagrange multipliers arising from discretization.
