## 0. Tail bounds for the Dyson series of random Schrödinger equations

**Authors:** Adam Black, Reuben Drogin, Felipe Hernández

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02566v1)

**Summary:**

We study Schr\"odinger equations on $d\geq 2$ with random potentials of strength. Our main result gives tail bounds for the terms of the Dyson series. We obtain estimates on the frequency localization and spatial delocalization of approximate eigenfunctions in the spirit of works by Schlag-Shubin-Wolff and T. Chen. These estimates also apply to Floquet states associated to time-periodic potentials. Our proof is elementary in that we use neither sophisticated harmonic analysis nor diagrammatic arguments.

## 1. Energy field of critical Ising model and examples of singular fields in   QFT

**Authors:** Christophe Garban, Antti Kupiainen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02554v1)

**Summary:**

The goal of this paper is to prove singularity of three natural fields in QFT with respect to their natural base measure. The fields we consider are the following ones:   (1) The near-critical limit of the $2d$ Ising model (in the $h$-direction) is locally singular w.r.t the critical scaling limit. (2) The $2D$ Hierarchical Sine-Gordon field is singular in the $3d$ hierarchical GFF. (3) The $\Phi^4_3$ field is also proved to be singular in [BG21, OOT21, HKN24].

## 2. Contextuality of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes

**Authors:** Derek Khu, Andrew Tanggara, Kishor Bharti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02553v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum error correction is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation. The role of contextuality, a fundamental non-classical feature of quantum theory, remains unexplored. In this work, we establish the first direct link between contextuality and quantum error-correcting codes. We further show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual, while others are noncontextual. We present several findings, including the proof of a conjecture by Kim and Abramsky.

## 3. Fluctuations of stochastic charged cellular automata

**Authors:** Žiga Krajnik, Katja Klobas, Bruno Bertini, Tomaž Prosen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02509v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02509v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles. We identify the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolated between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in thelimit of pure transmission. We show that the model can be used to solve the problem.

## 4. Generalized quantum Zernike Hamiltonians: Polynomial Higgs-type algebras   and algebraic derivation of the spectrum

**Authors:** Rutwig Campoamor-Stursberg, Francisco J. Herranz, Danilo Latini, Ian Marquette, Alfonso Blasco

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02491v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the quantum analog of the generalized Zernike systems given by the Hamiltonian. We uncover a polynomial Higgs-type symmetry algebra that, through an appropriate change of basis, gives rise to a deformed oscillator algebra. This framework enables an algebraic determination of the possible energy spectra of the model for the cases $N=2,3,4. We propose two conjectures which generalize the results for all $N\ge 2$ and any value of the coefficients $gamma_k$

## 5. Improved semiclassical eigenvalue estimates for the Laplacian and the   Landau Hamiltonian

**Authors:** Rupert L. Frank, Simon Larson, Paul Pfeiffer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02388v1)

**Summary:**

The Berezin--Li--Yau and the Kr\"oger inequalities show that Riesz means of order 1 are bounded in terms of their semiclassical limit expressions. We show that these inequalities can be improved by a multiplicative factor that depends only on the dimension and the product. The same holds when $|\Omega|^{1/d}$ is replaced by a generalized inradius of $Omega$. Finally, we show similar inequalities in two dimensions in the presence of a constant magnetic field.

## 6. Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas

**Authors:** Pierre-François Loos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378v1)

**Summary:**

The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) This work introduces excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited- state UEG's as functions of the density and the gap. Also, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit of the UEG. The present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals.

## 7. Stochastic quantization of $λφ_2^4$- theory in 2-d Moyal space

**Authors:** Chunqiu Song, Hendrik Weber, Raimar Wulkenhaar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02355v1)

**Summary:**

There is strong evidence for the conjecture that the QFT- model on 4-dimensional non-commutative Moyal space can be non-perturbatively constructed. As preparation, in this paper we construct the 2-dimensional case with the method of stochastic quantization. We show the local well-posedness and global well-posingness of the stochastically quantization equation. This leads to a construction of the Moyal measure for any non-negative coupling constant.

## 8. Sub-Power Law Decay of the Wave Packet Maximum in Disordered Anharmonic   Chains

**Authors:** Wojciech De Roeck, Lydia Giacomin, Amirali Hannani, Francois Huveneers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02344v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the peak of an initially localized wave packet in one-dimensional nonlinear disordered chains decays more slowly than any power law of time. Our results apply in the long-time limit, hold almost surely, and are valid for arbitrary finite energy values. The systems under investigation are Klein-Gordon and non linear disordered Schr\"odinger-type chains, characterized by a harmonic onsite disordered potential and quartic nearest-neighbor coupling. We show that our results hold almost certainly.

## 9. Courant Algebroid Relations, T-Dualities and Generalised Ricci Flow

**Authors:** Thomas C. De Fraja, Vincenzo Emilio Marotta, Richard J. Szabo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02318v1)

**Summary:**

The notion of Courant algebroid relation is used to introduce a definition of relation between divergence operators on CourantAlgebroids. By introducing invariant divergence operators, a notion of generalised T-duality between divergences is presented. This enables an analysis of the compatibility between T- duality and generalised Ricci flow, showing that the T-Dual of a solution of generalise Ricci Flow is also a solution for generalised Richec flow.

## 10. Long-time asymptotics for the $N_{\infty}$-soliton solution to the KdV   equation with two types of generalized reflection coefficients

**Authors:** Guoqiang Zhang, Zhenya Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02273v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02273v1)

**Summary:**

We systematically investigate the long-time asymptotics for the $N_{\infty}$-soliton solution to the KdV equation in the different regions. We use the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems with two types of generalized reflection coefficients. A critical step in the analysis of RH problems via the Deift-Zhou steepest descent technique is how to construct local parametrices around the endpoints and singularity. This comprehensive study extends the understanding of generalized reflections and provides valuable insights into the asymPTotics of soliton gases.

## 11. Rigorous analysis of large-space and long-time asymptotics for the   short-pulse soliton gases

**Authors:** Guoqiang Zhang, Weifang Weng, Zhenya Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02261v1)

**Summary:**

We rigorously analyze the asymptotics of soliton gases to the short-pulse (SP) equation. The soliton gas is formulated in terms of a RH problem, which is derived from the RH problems of the $N$-soliton solutions. The analysis is performed using the steepest descent method. To address the singularity at the origin, we introduce an innovative piecewise definition of $g$-function. To establish the order of the error term, we construct local parametrices near $j = 1, 2$ and singularity $eta_0.

## 12. Numerical simulation of Lugiato-Lefever equation for Kerr combs   generation in Fabry-Perot resonators

**Authors:** Mouhamad Al Sayed Ali, Stéphane Balac, Germain Bourcier, Gabriel Caloz, Monique Dauge, Arnaud Fernandez, Olivier Lliopis, Fabrice Mahé

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02136v1)

**Summary:**

Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with damping, detuning and driving terms. introduced as a model for Kerr combs generation in ring-shape resonators and more recently, in a variant, in Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators. The aim of this paper is to present some numerical methods that complement each other to solve the LLE in its general form both in the dynamic and in the steady state regimes. We also provide some mathematical properties of the L LE likely to help the understanding and interpretation of the numerical simulation results.

## 13. Explicit solution for the hyperbolic homogeneous scalar one-dimensional   conservation law

**Authors:** Didier Clamond

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02111v1)

**Summary:**

A complex integral formula provides an explicit solution of the initial value problem for the nonlinear scala 1D equation. This formula is valid at least as long as $u$ remains analytic. For any flux $f(u)$ and initial condition $u\_0(x)$ that are analytic, this formula is also valid. For example, $u=0, $f=1, and $u+1=2, $u-1,$ $f-2,$ $u-3,$  $F(u),$ $f-4,$ f-5,$F-6, F-7, FP-8,FP-9,

## 14. Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion   in super-renormalizable QFTs

**Authors:** Yizhuang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we address the issue regarding the high-power behavior of power-expansion/OPE-exp expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high- power terms in the coefficient functions. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent. The enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating.

**Authors:** Mee Seong Im, Clement Kam, Caden Pici

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01983v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a diagrammatic perspective for Shannon entropy created by the first author and Mikhail Khovanov. We connect it to information theory and mutual information. We also give two complete proofs that the $5$-term dilogarithm deforms to the $4$- term infinitesimal dilogrithm. We conclude with a list of questions to be answered in the next issue of Theoretical Computer Science. The next issue will be published in the spring of 2015.

## 16. Quantum expanders and property (T) discrete quantum groups

**Authors:** Michael Brannan, Eric Culf, Matthijs Vernooij

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01974v1)

**Summary:**

Families of expander graphs were first constructed by Margulis from discrete groups with property (T) Within the framework of quantum information theory, several authors have generalised the notion of an expander graph to the setting of quantum channels. In this work, we use discrete quantum groups to construct quantum expanders in two ways. The first approach obtains a quantum expander family by constructing the requisite quantum channels directly from finite-dimensional irreducible unitary representations. The second approach is based on a quantum analogue of a Schreier graph using the theory of coideals.
