## 0. Derivation of the Chern-Simons-Schrödinger equation from the dynamics   of an almost-bosonic-anyon gas

**Authors:** Théotime Girardot, Jinyeop Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13080v1)

**Summary:**

We study the time evolution of an initial product state in a system of almost-bosonic-extended-anyons in the large-particle limit. We show that the dynamics of this system can be well approximated, in finite time, by a product state evolving under the effective Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation. We provide a convergence rate for the approximation in terms of the radius $R = (log N)^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}$ of the extended anyons.

## 1. Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint   qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity

**Authors:** Ivan Gudoshnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity. We show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation) Yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function -valued strain. In contrast, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. More advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones.

## 2. Characterization of the directed landscape from the KPZ fixed point

**Authors:** Duncan Dauvergne, Lingfu Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13032v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the directed landscape is the unique coupling of the KPZ fixed point from all initial conditions at all times satisfying three natural properties. We apply this framework to prove convergence for a range of models, some without exact solvability. These models include asymmetric exclusion processes with potentially non-nearest neighbour interactions, exotic couplings of ASEP, the random walk and Brownian web distance. All of our convergence theorems are new except for colored A SEP and the KPz equation, where we provide alternative proofs.

## 3. Optimal convergence speed in the classical limits of relativistic   Cucker-Smale models

**Authors:** Seung-Yeal Ha, Tommaso Ruggeri, Qinghua Xiao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13015v1)

**Summary:**

We study quantitative estimates for the flocking and uniform-time classical limit to the relativistic Cucker-Smale (in short RCS) model introduced in Ha-Kim-Ruggeri-ARMA-2020. For the RCS model, we provide a quantitative estimate on the uniform time classical limit with an optimal convergence rate which is the same as in finite-time Classical limit under a relaxed initial condition. This removes earlier constraints employed in the previous classical limit. As a direct application of this optimal convergence rates in the classical limit of the R CS, we derive an optimal converge rate for the corresponding uniform time limit for the kinetic R CS model.

## 4. All non-Gaussian states are advantageous for channel discrimination:   Robustness of non-convex continuous variable quantum resources

**Authors:** Leah Turner, Madalin Guta, Gerardo Adesso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13011v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum resource theories provide a mathematical framework for quantifying the advantage given by quantum phenomena in various tasks. The generalized robustness is one such quantifier, and enjoys an operational interpretation in the setting of channel discrimination. We show it has two operational interpretations: firstly, it provides an upper bound on the maximal advantage in a multi-copy channel discrimination task. Secondly, in many relevant theories, it quantifies the worst-case advantage in single- copy channel discrimination when considering a decomposition of the free states into convex subsets.

## 5. On Haantjes tensors for second-order superintegrable systems

**Authors:** Ian Marquette, Damien McLeod, Serena Scapucci, Andreas Vollmer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13007v1)

**Summary:**

The vanishing of the Haantjes tensor is an important property that has been linked, for instance, to the existence of separation coordinates and the integrability of systems of hydrodynamic type. In particular, we investigate HaantJes-zero Killing tensor fields that are associated with second-order superintegrable systems. We discuss the vanishing of a Killing Tensor field for operator fields that admit a large number of so-called conservation laws. We also discuss Haant jes Killing tensors for second- order superintegrating systems.

## 6. Isoperimetric inequality for nonlocal bi-axial discrete perimeter

**Authors:** V. Jacquier, W. M. Ruszel, C. Spitoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13005v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13005v1)

**Summary:**

In the present manuscript we address and solve for the first time a nonlocal discrete isoperimetric problem. We find and characterize its minimizers in the class of polyominoes with fixed area $n$. We explain how the solution is related to the rigorous study of the metastable behavior of a long-range bi-axial Ising model. We consider indeed a generalization of the classical perimeter, what we call a non local bi-Axial discrete perimeter. We conclude by saying that the solution of the nonlocal isoperimetry problem is related to the study of the metastable behavior of a long-range Ising model.

## 7. Large gap asymptotics of the hard edge tacnode process

**Authors:** Junwen Liu, Luming Yao, Lun Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12920v1)

**Summary:**

Gap probability of the hard edge thinned/unthinned tacnode process over $(0,s)$. We establish an integral representation of the gap probability in terms of the Hamiltonian associated with a system of differential equations. With the aids of some remarkable differential identities, we are able to derive the associated large gap asymptotics, up to and including the constant term in the thinned case. Some applications of our results are discussed as well. The results of this work can be used to solve some tiling problems.

## 8. Shifted Poisson structures on higher Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras

**Authors:** Cameron Kemp, Robert Laugwitz, Alexander Schenkel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12804v1)

**Summary:**

This paper develops a graphical calculus to determine the $n$-shifted Poisson structures on finitely generated semi-free commutative differential graded algebras. When applied to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of an ordinary Lie algebra, we recover Safronov's result that the $(n=1)$- and ($n=2)$ shifted Poisson structures are given by quasi-Lie bialgebra structures and, respectively, symmetric tensors. We generalize these results to the Chevalley Eilenburg algebra of a Lie $2$-algebra and obtain $n\in\{1,2,3,4\}$ shifted Po

## 9. Stochastic Localization with Non-Gaussian Tilts and Applications to   Tensor Ising Models

**Authors:** Dan Mikulincer, Arianna Piana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12720v1)

**Summary:**

We present generalizations and modifications of Eldan's Stochastic Localization process. We extend it to incorporate non-Gaussian tilts, making it useful for a broader class of measures. We introduce new processes that enable the decomposition and analysis of non-quadratic potentials on the Boolean hypercube. Using this framework, we derive new spectral gap estimates for tensor Ising models under Glauber dynamics, resulting in rapid mixing. We conclude with a specific focus on quartic polynomials.

## 10. Dirac operators and local invariants on perturbations of Minkowski space

**Authors:** Nguyen Viet Dang, András Vasy, Michał Wrochna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12714v1)

**Summary:**

For small perturbations of Minkowski space, we show that the square of the Lorentzian Dirac operator $P= -D^2$ has real spectrum apart from possible poles in a horizontal strip. We relate the poles of the spectral zeta function density of $P-i\varepsilon$ to local invariants. The proof involves microlocal propagation and radial estimates in a resolved scattering calculus as well as high energy estimates in further resolved classical-semiclassical calculus.

## 11. Alterfold Theory and Topological Modular Invariance

**Authors:** Zhengwei Liu, Shuang Ming, Yilong Wang, Jinsong Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12702v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a topological paradigm in alterfold topological quantum field theory to explore various concepts. Using our topological perspective, we provide streamlined quick proofs and broad generalizations of a wide range of results. We establish a novel integral identity for modular invariance across multiple Morita contexts, unifying several known identities as special cases. We introduce the concept of double $Z$-induction and define its higher-genus $Z-transformation, which remains invariant under the action of the mapping class group.

## 12. W-algebras, Gaussian Free Fields and $\mathfrak{g}$-Dotsenko-Fateev   integrals

**Authors:** Baptiste Cerclé

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12657v1)

**Summary:**

We study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a probabilistic representation of the $W-algebra associated to any simple and complex Lie algebra. We show that this correspondence can be used to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions in the form of Ward identities. This leads to new integrability results concerning Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to a simple Lie algebra $B_2$

## 13. Principal bundles in the category of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds

**Authors:** Andrew James Bruce, Janusz Grabowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12652v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12652v1)

**Summary:**

In principle, the geometry of $n>1$ is essentially different than that of supermanifolds. However, a full version of differential calculus is still valid. We show that the fundamental properties of classical principal bundles can be generalised to the setting of this `higher graded' geometry, with properly defined frame bundles as canonical examples. A comprehensive introduction to $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifold is therefore included together with basic examples. The paper also includes a list of basic examples of the geometry.

## 14. Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle   interactions

**Authors:** Hobbes Sprague, Shanmuka Shivashankara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585v1)

**Summary:**

Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. The article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics for any particle interaction. For the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton, the language of relativistic quantum mechanics is used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation. For hard scattering, unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function.

## 15. Points on Rational Normal Curves and the ABCT Variety

**Authors:** Daniele Agostini, Lakshmi Ramesh, Dawei Shen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12514v1)

**Summary:**

The ABCT variety is defined as the closure of the image of $G(2,n)$ under the Veronese map. It is the determinantal variety of a vector bundle morphism. We show that special Schubert coefficients of this class are given by Eulerian numbers, matching a formula by Cachazo-He-Yuan. We prove that the variety of configuration of points on a common divisor on a smooth variety is reduced and irreducible.
