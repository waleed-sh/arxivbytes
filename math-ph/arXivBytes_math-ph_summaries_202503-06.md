## 0. F-theory with hyperelliptic fibrations

**Authors:** E. Ballico, E. Gasparim, M. P. García del Moral, C. las Heras

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03673v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the role of hyperelliptic fibrations in F-theory. For each even integer $n$ we give a noncompact Calabi--Yau threefold. We show that tadpole cancellation conditions are satisfied for arbitrarily large values of $c_2(X)$. Our explicit examples have split Jacobian, preserving the same number of degrees of freedom of usual F-Theory. But we allow for the appearance of a greater variety of singularities.

## 1. Rare Flat Bands for Periodic Graph Operators

**Authors:** Matthew Faust, Wencai Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03632v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03632v1)

**Summary:**

For an arbitrary connected $\mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic graph, we treat edge weights and potentials as variables and prove that, generically (meaning outside a proper algebraic subset of the variable space) the corresponding periodic graph operators do not have flat bands. For an arbitrary connected $Z$- Periodic Graph, we prove that the corresponding periodic graph operators do not have flat bands. We exercise this proving that the graphs are not connected.

## 2. On the Lee-Yang property of some ferromagnets

**Authors:** Yuri Kozitsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03510v1)

**Summary:**

According to the Lieb-Sokal theorem, the partition function, $Z$ of a ferromagnetic spin model has the Lee-Yang property if the single-spin partition function has it. In this note, it is shown that for some spin models a feromagnetic interaction can induce the Lee Yang property. This holds for the Blume-Capel model and for annealed states of the $s=\pm 1$ site dilute Ising model with a neares-neighbor interaction.

## 3. On the construction of polynomial Poisson algebras: a novel grading   approach

**Authors:** Rutwig Campoamor-Stursberg, Danilo Latini, Ian Marquette, Junze Zhang, Yao-Zhong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03490v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we refine recent results on the explicit construction of polynomial algebras associated with commutants. We consider an additional grading with respect to the subalgebra. It is shown that such an approach simplifies and systematizes the explicit derivation of the Lie--Poisson brackets of elements in the commutant. The procedure is illustrated by revisiting three relevant reduction chains associated with the rank-two complex simple Lie algebra $S(A_3)$.

## 4. Interaction-correlated random matrices

**Authors:** Abbas Ali Saberi, Sina Saber, Roderich Moessner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03472v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03472v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a family of random matrices where correlations between matrix elements are induced via interaction-derived Boltzmann factors. Varying these yields access to different ensembles. We find a universal scaling behavior of the finite-size statistics characterized by a heavy-tailed eigenvalue distribution. The link between maximum eigenvalues and order parameters offers a potential route to resolving long-standing problems in statistical physics, such as deriving the exact magnetization scaling function in the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality.

## 5. Symmetries and Noether's theorem for multicontact field theories

**Authors:** Xavier Rivas, Narciso Román-Roy, Bartosz M. Zawora

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03463v1)

**Summary:**

A geometric framework, called multicontact geometry, has recently been developed to study action-dependent field theories. In this work, we use this framework to analyze symmetries in action- dependent Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field theories, as well as their associated dissipation laws. The latter ones lead to the formulation of a version of Noether's Theorem in this setting. We establish the definitions of conserved and dissipated quantities, define the general symmetry of the field equations and the geometric structure, and examine their properties.

## 6. Heat semigroups on quantum automorphism groups of finite dimensional   C*-algebras

**Authors:** Futaba Sato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03448v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate heat semigroups on a quantum automorphism group. We show ultracontractivity, hypercontractivity, and the spectral gap inequality. Furthermore, we obtain the sharpness of the Sobolev embedding property and the Hausdorff-Young inequality of ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$. The paper is published by SAGE Publications, a division of SAGE, Inc. in New York, U.S., and is free to read.

## 7. On the classification of centralizers of ODOs: An effective differential   algebra approach

**Authors:** Sonia L Rueda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03429v1)

**Summary:**

The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators and algebraic curves has been extensively and deeply studied since Burchnall-Chaundy in 1923. This paper is an overview of recent developments to make this correspondence computationally effective, by means of differential algebra and symbolic computation. The ultimate goal is to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems $L(y)=\lambda y$, for a generic $L-\lambda$ and a new coefficient field, defined by the coefficient field of $L$ and $Gamma.

## 8. Loop vs. Bernoulli percolation on trees: strict inequality of critical   values

**Authors:** Andreas Klippel, Benjamin Lees, Christian Mönch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03319v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03319v1)

**Summary:**

We consider loop ensembles on random trees. The loops are induced by a Poisson process of links sampled on the underlying tree interpreted as a metric graph. We show that the threshold Poisson intensity at which an infinite loop arises is strictly larger than the corresponding quantity for percolation of the untyped links. We also provide a partial converse to the strict-inequality result in the case of Galton-Watson trees and improve previously established criteria for the existence of an infiniteloop.

## 9. Noetherian Conservation Laws for Photons in Curved Spacetime

**Authors:** Michael K. -H. Kiessling, A. Shadi Tahvildar-Zadeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03271v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03271v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate a Lorentz-covariant bispinorial wave function and wave equation for a single photon on a curved background with no symmetries. We show the existence of a 10-dimensional set of conservation laws for this equation. We prove that on an asymptotically flat background 8 of these conservation laws yield global, gauge-invariant, ADM-like quantities that together define a covariantly constant self-dual bisp inor.

## 10. Non-resonant Hopf Links Near a Hamiltonian Equilibrium Point

**Authors:** C. Grotta-Ragazzo, Lei Liu, Pedro A. S. Salomão

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03226v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03226v1)

**Summary:**

This paper is about the existence of periodic orbits near an equilibrium point of a two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system. The equilibrium is supposed to be a nondegenerate minimum of the Hamiltonian. Every sphere-like component of the energy surface sufficiently close to the equilibrium contains at least two periodic orbits forming a Hopf link. The main results focus on strongly resonant equilibrium points and apply to the Spatial Isosceles Three-Body Problem, Hill's Lunar Problem, and the H\'enon-Heiles System.

## 11. A class of anisotropic diffusion-transport equations in non-divergence   form

**Authors:** Luan Hoang, Akif Ibragimov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03089v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03089v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize Einstein's probabilistic method for the Brownian motion to study compressible fluids in porous media. The multi-dimensional case is considered with general probability distribution functions. By relating the expected displacement per unit time with the velocity of the fluid, we derive an anisotropic diffusion equation in non-divergence form that contains a transport term. The classical solutions of this equation are studied, and the maximum and strong maximum principles are established. We also obtain exponential decay estimates for the solutions for all time, and particularly their exponential convergence as time tends to infinity.
