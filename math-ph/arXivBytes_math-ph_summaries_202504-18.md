## 0. Relative entropy of squeezed states in Quantum Field Theory

**Authors:** Marcelo S. Guimaraes, Itzhak Roditi, Silvio P. Sorella, Arthur F. Vieira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13148v1)

**Summary:**

Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a squeezed state and the vacuum state in a free relativistic massive scalar Quantum Field Theory. This relative entropy is proportional to the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution. The entropy remains positive, increases with the size of the Minkowski region under consideration, and decreases as the mass parameter grows. It satisfies all expected properties: it remains positive and increases with size of Minkowskis region. It also decreases as mass parameters grow.

## 1. Supersymmetric Poisson and Poisson-supersymmetric sigma models

**Authors:** Thomas Basile, Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis, Sylvain Lavau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13114v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit and construct new examples of supersymmetric 2D topological sigma models whose target space is a Poisson supermanifold. Inspired by the AKSZ construction of topological field theories, we follow a graded-geometric approach. We identify two commuting homological vector fields compatible with the graded symplectic structure, which control the gauge symmetries and the supersymmetries of the sigma model. We show that the common thread through this type of models is that their supersymmetry-generating vector field is the coadjoint representation up to homotopy of a Lie algebroid.

## 2. Time-Varying Spectrum of the Random String

**Authors:** Lorenzo Galleani, Leon Cohen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12995v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the response of a finite string to white noise and obtain the exact time-dependent spectrum. The complete exact solution is obtained, that is, both the transient and steady-state solution. Limiting cases for small and large times are obtained. As a special case we obtain the results of van Lear Jr. and Uhlenbeck and Lyon. A numerical example is given and the results plotted. The results are plotted in terms of the time-varying spectrum of the string.

## 3. Characterization of the $W_{1+\infty}$-n-algebra and applications

**Authors:** Fridolin Melong, Raimar Wulkenhaar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12994v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we construct the $W_{1+\infty}$-n-algebras in the framework of the generalized quantum algebra. We characterize the $\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-multi-variable $W_1+ \infty$-algebra and derive its $n$- algebra which is the generalized Lie algebra for $ n$ even. We investigate the $R(p) -elliptic hermitian matrix model and determine a toy model.

## 4. Dynamical relationship between CAR algebras and determinantal point   processes: point processes at finite temperature and stochastically positive   KMS systems

**Authors:** Ryosuke Sato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12935v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of this paper is threefold. We develop the author's previous work on the dynamical relationship between determinantal point processes and CAR algebras. We present a novel application of the theory of stochastic processes associated with KMS states. We propose a unified theory of algebraic constructions and analysis of stationary processes on point configuration spaces. As a byproduct, we establish an algebraic derivation of a determinedantal formula for space-time correlations of stoChastic processes.

## 5. Eigenvalue distribution in gaps of the essential spectrum of the   Bochner-Schrödinger operator

**Authors:** Yuri A. Kordyukov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12928v1)

**Summary:**

The Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_p$ on high tensor powers $L^p$ of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ of bounded geometry is studied. For large $p$ the spectrum of the operator asymptotically coincides with the union of all local Landau levels. The main result of the paper is the trace asymPTotics formula associated with these eigenvalues.

## 6. A Holomorphic perspective of Strict Deformation Quantization

**Authors:** Michael Heins

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12862v1)

**Summary:**

We provide and discuss complex analytic methods for overcoming the formal character of formal deformation quantization. This is a necessity for returning to physically meaningful statements, and accounts for the fact that the formal parameter $hbar$ carries the interpretation of Planck's constant. As formal star products are given by a formal power series, this naturally leads into the realm of holomorphic functions and analytic continuation. Numerous auxiliary results, many of which are well-known yet remarkable in their own right, are provided throughout.

## 7. Miura transformation in bidifferential calculus and a vectorial Darboux   transformation for the Fokas-Lenells equation

**Authors:** Folkert Müller-Hoissen, Rusuo Ye

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12822v1)

**Summary:**

Using bidifferential calculus and recent results, a vectorial binary Darboux transformation is derived for the first member of the "negative" part of the potential Kaup-Newell hierarchy. The reduction to the Fokas-Lenells equation is implemented and exact solutions with a plane wave seed generated. Miura transformations are found from the latter to the first members of the negative part of AKNS hierarchy and also to its "pseudodual", for example, the "positive" part.

## 8. An etude on a renormalization

**Authors:** A. V. Ivanov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12818v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study renormalization, that is, the procedure for eliminating singularities, for a special model. A special deformation of the spectrum is used as regularization. It is remarkably that the divergences, which have the same form in one approach, acquire a different nature in another approach and lead to interesting consequences. We use both combinatorial techniques in the framework of working with formal series, and using a limit transition in a standard multidimensional integral, taking into account the removal of the singular components.

## 9. Macroscopic states and operations: a generalized resource theory of   coherence

**Authors:** Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12738v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we focus on the concept of macroscopic states, i.e. coarse representations of microscopic details. These are states that can be inferred solely from the outcomes of Macroscopic measurements. We develop a resource theory of microscopicity that unifies and generalizes existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, purity, and asymmetry. Finally, we reinterpret macroscopy entropy as a measure of inferential asymmetry,i.e., irretrodictability.
