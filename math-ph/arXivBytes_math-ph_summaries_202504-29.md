## 0. Revisiting the temporal law in KPZ random growth

**Authors:** Mustazee Rahman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19975v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19975v1)

**Summary:**

This article studies the temporal law of the KPZ fixed point. For the droplet geometry, we find a relatively simpler formula for the multi-time law compared to a previous formula of Johansson and the author. We find the two- time law, which extends the single time law due to Baik-Rains and Ferrari-Spohn. These formulas are derived as the scaling limit of corresponding multi- time formulas for geometric last passage percolation. For more information, see the article 'KPZ Fixed Point temporal law'

## 1. SUSY hierarchies of Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians with different detuning   parameters

**Authors:** İsmail Burak Ateş, Şengül Kuru, Javier Negro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19943v1)

**Summary:**

 supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be applied to the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian of quantum optics. JC Hamiltonians can be classified in hierarchies or sequences which are connected through SUSY transformations. As a byproduct, the symmetries ofJC Hamiltonians are found as well as the special case of a sequence of resonant-like interacting systems having the form of a simple shape invariant JC Hamiltonian hierarchy.

## 2. Factorization of multimeters: a unified view on nonclassical quantum   phenomena

**Authors:** Tim Achenbach, Andreas Bluhm, Leevi Leppäjärvi, Ion Nechita, Martin Plávala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19865v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19865v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum theory exhibits various nonclassical features, such as measurement incompatibility, contextuality, steering, and Bell nonlocality. These phenomena are often studied separately, but they possess deep interconnections. This work introduces a unified mathematical framework based on commuting diagrams that unifies them. We show that measurement compatibility and simulability correspond to specific factorizations of these maps through intermediate systems. We provide factorization-based characterizations for steering assemblages and Bell correlations, including a perspective on the CHSH inequality witnessing measurement incomp compatibility.

## 3. Quantum Error Correction in Quaternionic Hilbert Spaces

**Authors:** Valentine Nyirahafashimana, Nurisya Mohd Shah, Umair Abdul Halim, Mohamed Othman, Sharifah Kartini Said Husain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19833v1)

**Summary:**

We propose quaternion-based strategies for quantum error correction. We define quaternionic analogues of Pauli operators and quantum gates. A simple encoding scheme maps logical qubits into quaternionics systems. This introduces natural redundancy and enhanced resilience against noise. These results suggest a new pathway for quantumerror correction in high-noise environments. We hope to use the richer structure of quaternION quantum mechanics to improve fault tolerance. The study was published in the open-access journal Theoretical Physics.

## 4. Bethe roots for periodic TASEP and algebraic curve

**Authors:** Shinsuke Iwao, Kohei Motegi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19690v1)

**Summary:**

We present an algebraic method to study solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations for the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) We give an algebro-geometric formulation of the spectral problem for the periodic TASEP with arbitrary numbers of sites and particles. We also give explicit formulas for the number of connected components, number of ramification points, and the total genus of the Riemann surface. We explore applications of the special type of Bethe roots that appear in this case to partition functions of the five-vertex model.

## 5. On Unitary Groups in Ternary and Generalized Clifford Algebras

**Authors:** D. S. Shirokov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19689v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19689v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss a generalization of Clifford algebras known as generalized Clifford alges. In these objects, we have a fixed higher-degree form (in particular, a ternary form) instead of a quadratic form. Basis-free definitions of the determinant, trace, and characteristic polynomial are introduced. The operation of Hermitian conjugation is introduced without using the corresponding matrix representations. We present a natural realization of unitary Lie groups, which are important in physics and other applications.

## 6. On post-Lie structures for free Lie algebras

**Authors:** Annika Burmester, Ulf Kühn

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19661v1)

**Summary:**

Using a magmatic approach, we explore post-Lie algebras connected to multiple zeta values and their $q$-analogues. This framework yields an algebraic interpretation of the Goncharov coproduct. We conjecture a correspondence for the uri bracket and identify the ari bracket with a post- Lie structure on a free Lie algebra. We provide an abstract formula for its dualcoproduct, which might be of interest for the general theory of post-Hopf algebraes.

## 7. Extremal Ising Gibbs States on Lobachevsky planes

**Authors:** Matteo D'Achille, Loren Coquille, Arnaud Le Ny

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19553v1)

**Summary:**

We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges. This result is implied by an extension of the article [9] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We argue how we can deduce the extremality of a subset of the Series-Sinai states [30] at low temperature.

## 8. Scattering for the positive density Hartree equation

**Authors:** Antoine Borie, Sonae Hadama, Julien Sabin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19552v1)

**Summary:**

We study the asymptotic stability for large times of homogeneous stationary states for the nonlinear Hartree equation for density matrices in Rd. We can reach both the optimal Sobolev and Schatten exponents for the initial data, with a wide class of interaction potentials w. Our method relies on fractional Leibniz rules fordensity matrices to deal with the fractional critical SoboleV regularity s = d/2 -1 for odd d, as well as Christ-Kiselev lemmas in Schatten spaces.

## 9. Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice   Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras

**Authors:** Mu Li, Xiaohan Yang, Xiao-Yu Dong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19512v1)

**Summary:**

The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation is rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations. We propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. We believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.

## 10. Invariance of subbundles and nonholonomic trajectories

**Authors:** Andrew D. Lewis, Ahmed G. Shaltut

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19430v1)

**Summary:**

In the comparison of nonholonomic mechanics and constrained variational mechanics, invariant affine subbundles arise in the determination of the initial conditions where the two methods yield the same trajectories. The formal integrability of the resulting linear partial differential equation is determined using Spencer cohomology. Finally, the problem of a disc rolling on an inclined plane with no-slip is considered as an example to illustrate the theory. The theory is based on the theory of nonholonomic mechanics.

## 11. A topological quantum field theory for $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons

**Authors:** Rafael Herrera, Sergio A. Holguin Cardona, Alexander Quintero Velez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19403v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a topological quantum field theory based on the moduli space of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons on 8-dimensional manifolds. We then reformulate the theory within the AKSZ formalism, obtaining a Batalin-Vilkovisky action that, after gauge fixing, matches our Mathai-Quillen construction. We also show that the action can be elegantly recast as a Chern-Simons type theory.
