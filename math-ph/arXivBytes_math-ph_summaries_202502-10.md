## 0. Lie algebras with compatible scalar products for non-homogeneous   Hamiltonian operators

**Authors:** Giorgio Gubbiotti, Francesco Oliveri, Emanuele Sgroi, Pierandrea Vergallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05137v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonian operators are sum of a non-degenerate first-order homogeneous operator and a Poisson tensor. In flat coordinates, also known as Darboux coordinates, these operators are uniquely determined by a triple composed by a Lie algebra. We present some classes of operators associated to Lie algebras with non- Degenerate quadratic Casimirs and we give a description of such operators in low dimensions. Finally, motivated by the example of the KdV equation we discuss the conditions of bi-Hamiltonianity ofsuch operators.

## 1. De Sitter quantum gravity within the covariant Lorentzian approach to   asymptotic safety

**Authors:** Edoardo D'Angelo, Renata Ferrero, Markus B. Fröb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05135v1)

**Summary:**

The study is the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges. The study was published in the journal Theoretical and Applied Physics.

## 2. Dirac's variational approach to semiclassical Kramers problem in   Smoluchowski limit

**Authors:** Choon-Lin Ho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05079v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05079v1)

**Summary:**

Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassicals potential. The potential can be used to study the behavior of kramers in the quantum mechanical system. For more information on the potential, see Dirac and Kerman's potential.

## 3. On coefficients of operator product expansions for quantum field   theories with ordinary, holomorphic, and topological spacetime dimensions

**Authors:** Luigi Alfonsi, Hyungrok Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05077v1)

**Summary:**

In many quantum field theories, operator product expansions of local operators can have as coefficients not only ordinary functions but also 'derived' functions with nonzero ghost number. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such ' derived' functions to appear. In particular, theories with one topological spacetime dimension and multiple ordinary spacetime dimensions provide a smooth analogue of the (holomorphic) raviolo. We analyse the functions that should appear in operator product. expansions for a quantum field theory with an arbitrary number of topological, holomorphic and/or ordinary Spacetime dimensions.

## 4. Scaling of highly excited Schrödinger-Poisson eigenstates and   universality of their rotation curves

**Authors:** Gaia Marangon, Antonio Ponno, Lorenzo Zanelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05030v1)

**Summary:**

This work provides a comprehensive numerical characterization of the excited spherically symmetric stationary states of the Schrodinger-Poisson problem. The analysis is conducted with reference to dark matter distributions around galaxies. Key characteristics of the eigenfunctions include: the effective support, which exhibits a parabolic dependence on the excitation index; the distances between adjacent nodes, whose pattern varies regularly with $n$ and the oscillation amplitude, which follows a power law with an exponent approaching $-1$ for large $n$, consistent with astrophysical observations.

## 5. Functorial Einstein Algebras and the Malicious Singularity

**Authors:** Michael Heller, Tomasz Miller, Leszek Pysiak, Wiesław Sasin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04972v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04972v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein algebra, the concept due to Geroch, is essentially general relativity in an algebraic disguise. We introduce the concept of Einstein-Grassmann algebra as a superalgebra (defining a supermanifold) which is also an Einstein algebra. We prove that, if we relax algebraical requirements, the soul part of the algebra can survive the malicious singularity in general relativity. In particular, we study the behaviour of supercurves in the presence of malicious singularities.

## 6. Black Strings and String Clouds Embedded in Anisotropic Quintessence:   Solutions for Scalar Particles and Implications

**Authors:** Maria de Lourdes Deglmann, Leonardo G. Barbosa, Celso de Camargo Barros Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the spacetime metric associated with a black string surrounded by a cloud of strings and an anisotropic fluid of quintessence in cylindrically symmetric AdS spacetime. We solve Einstein's equation to obtain the explicit form of the metric. We use the confluent Heun function to solve the Klein-Gordon equation for a spin-0 particle near the event horizon. This modification, in principle, could give rise to an observable that we termed as the dark phase.

## 7. $Φ^4_3$ Theory from many-body quantum Gibbs states

**Authors:** Phan Thành Nam, Rongchan Zhu, Xiangchan Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04884v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04884v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum problem is typically formulated using a nonlocal interaction potential. A key challenge is to approximate the local theory by a Hartree measure with a non local interaction. We derive the $Phi^4_3$ measure on the torus as a rigorous limit of the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas. The connection to the quantum problem is then established by applying the variational approach in LewNamRou-21 and DeuNamNap-25. We then derive a quantitative convergence of quantum correlation functions to those of the Hartree classical field.

## 8. Ultraviolet Renormalization of Spin Boson Models I. Normal and   2-Nilpotent Interactions

**Authors:** Benjamin Hinrichs, Jonas Lampart, Javier Valentín Martín

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04876v1)

**Summary:**

We study the ultraviolet problem for models of a finite-dimensional quantum mechanical system linearly coupled to a bosonic quantum field. If the state change of the system upon emission or absorption of a boson is either given by a normal matrix or by a 2-nilpotent one, which is the case for the previously named examples, we prove an optimal renormalization result. We complement it, by proving the norm resolvent convergence of appropriately regularized models to the renormalized one.

## 9. Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure   States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases

**Authors:** M. A. Rajabpour, M. A. Seifi Mirjafarlou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04857v1)

**Summary:**

Computing amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics. Having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. The results provide a versatile framework for applications in global entanglement, Shannon-R\'enyi entropy, formation probabilities, and quantumTomography. They significantly expand the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems.

## 10. An Onsager type theorem for the Euler-Boussinesq equations in two   spatial dimensions

**Authors:** Ujjwal Koley

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04803v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04803v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we construct non-trivial weak solutions to the inviscid Euler-Boussinesq system in two spatial dimensions. These solutions exhibit compact temporal support, thereby violating the conservation of the temperature's $L^p$-norm. The methodology integrates a Nash iteration scheme with a linear decoupling technique to achieve these results. The pair $(v, \theta)$ resides in the H\"older space $C^\gamma$ for any exponent $\gamma<1/3$.

## 11. The detailed balance property and chemical systems out of equilibrium

**Authors:** E. Franco, J. J. L. Velázquez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04754v1)

**Summary:**

The detailed balance property is a fundamental property that must be satisfied in all the macroscopic systems with a well defined temperature at each point. Many biochemical networks work in non-equilibrium conditions and they can be effectively modelled using sets of equations in which the detailed balance condition fails. In this paper we study a class of "out of equilibrium" chemical networks that can be obtained freezing the concentration of some substances in chemical networks for which theDetailed balance property holds. In particular, we prove that any chemical system with bidirectional chemical reactions can be extended to a system having additional substances.

## 12. Equivariant primitives of Eisenstein series for congruence subgroups

**Authors:** Claude Duhr, Franca Lippert

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04752v1)

**Summary:**

We study equivariant primitives of Eisenstein series for principal congruence subgroups. We present closed formulas that naturally generalise existing results for the full modular group. We show that in those cases the non-holomorphic EisensteinSeries of weight two can be written as single-valued logarithms whose argument is a rational function of the Hauptmodul. We also focus on Eisenstein Series of weight 2 in the case where the modular curve has genus zero..

## 13. Enskog and Enskog-Vlasov equations with a slightly modified correlation   factor and their H theorem

**Authors:** Shigeru Takata, Aoto Takahashi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04744v1)

**Summary:**

A novel modification of the original Enskog equation is proposed. The modification is much simpler than that is made in the modified (or revised) EnSkog equation proposed by van Beijeren \& Ernst in 1973. The proposed modification is general enough to be adapted to various equations of states for non-ideal gases. It is shown that the H-theorem can be established for the Enskogs and the En Skog--Vlasov equation with the proposed modification.

## 14. Dark states in an integrable XY central spin model

**Authors:** Jaco van Tonder, Jon Links

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04651v1)

**Summary:**

Eigenstates of central spin models in which the central spin is unentangled with the environment are known as dark states. They have recently been observed in a class of integrable XX models. Here we find that dark states are present in XY models, but only for particular configurations of the centralspin magnetic field. We show this via an explicit construction of the Bethe states. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysics of Magnetic Fields, published by Oxford University Press.
