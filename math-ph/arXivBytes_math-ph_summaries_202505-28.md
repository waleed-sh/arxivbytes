## 0. On the Modulation of Wave Trains in the Ostrovsky Equation

**Authors:** Mathew A. Johnson, Jeffrey Oregero, Wesley R. Perkins

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21466v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21466v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the nonlinear wave modulation of arbitrary amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Ostrovsky equation. We first use Whitham's theory of modulations to derive a dispersionless system of quasilinear partial differential equations that is expected to model the slow evolution of the fundamental characteristics of a given wave train. Using rigorous spectral perturbation theory we then study the spectral (linearized) stability problem for aGiven wave train solution of the Ostrovskiy equation.

## 1. Scalar field stochastic dynamics in de Sitter spacetime from exact   solutions of quantum deficient oscillators

**Authors:** Yuta Nasuda, Koki Tokeshi, Yuki Watanabe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429v1)

**Summary:**

The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactlysolvable double- well model is also presented.

## 2. A Hyperbolic Approximation of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation

**Authors:** Abhijit Biswas, Laila S. Busaleh, David I. Ketcheson, Carlos Muñoz-Moncayo, Manvendra Rajvanshi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21424v1)

**Summary:**

We study a first-order hyperbolic approximation of   the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. We show that the system is strictlyhyperbolic and possesses a modified Hamiltonian structure. The system is formally equivalent to NLS in the relaxation limit. We develop asymptotic preserving discretizations that tend to a consistent discretization   of NLS while also conserving mass.   Examples for both the focusing and defocusing regimes demonstrate that the numerical discretized solution provides an accurate approximation.

## 3. Addition to "Structured random matrices and cyclic cumulants: A free   probability approach"

**Authors:** Denis Bernard, Ludwig Hruza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21376v1)

**Summary:**

We extend the so-called fourth axiom to deal with cumulants of disjoint cycles. We argue that theorems concerning the stability of such ensembles under non-linear transformations still hold with these refined axioms. We give a refined definition of the class of random matrix ensemble. We show that the stability of such ensembles under non-linear transitions still holds with these refined axioms and the theorems still hold.

## 4. Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles: Connections and Beyond

**Authors:** Andrew James Bruce

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21332v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles equipped with a degenerate metric. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. Alongside other results, we show that there is a canonical affine connection that is torsionless, but, in general, not compatible with the degenerate metrics. The construction of an affineconnection is intimately tied to a Kaluza-Klein geometry.

## 5. Empirical Demonstration of Quantum Contextuality on NISQ Computers

**Authors:** Colm Kelleher, Frédéric Holweck

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21243v1)

**Summary:**

We present definitive violations of non-contextual hidden variable bounds in the latest generation of IBM noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) These violations are based on known tests for contextuality such as the Rio Negro inequality and pseudo-telepathic Mermin games. These are the first violations of the classical Mermin game on IBM NISQ computers. The use of finite geometries proves instrumental in the development of more effective tests, with larger Geometries providing sizeable datasets from which multiple distinct experiments can be compared.

## 6. Fisher information from quantum many-particle arrival time measurements

**Authors:** Jukka Kiukas, Andreas Ruschhaupt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21214v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate a quantum arrival time measurement process for a Bosonic many-particle system. The aim is to extract statistical information on single-particles properties. We find that even though no information remains in the spatial distribution, the single-Particle momentum is identifiable from the arrival time data. Our results contribute to the fundamental understanding of temporal measurement data arising from quantum systems consisting of freely evolving particles, we say. We conclude with a tractable expression for the associated (classical) Fisher information.

## 7. On the Hamiltonian with Energy Levels Corresponding to Riemann Zeros

**Authors:** Xingpao Suo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21192v1)

**Summary:**

A Hamiltonian with eigenvalues $E_n $ has been constructed. It offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH) Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof. We generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. The construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E-n$ are not normalizable states.

## 8. A Correlational Bound for Eigenvalues of Fermionic 2-Body Operators

**Authors:** Martin Ravn Christiansen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21167v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that the eigenvalues of a 2-body operator. associated to a fermionic $N$-particle state are highly constrained by the structure of the corresponding eigenvectors. We also prove a lower bound on a conjecture motivated by these results. The conjecture is motivated by the fact that there is a finite number of $N-particles' in a $Psi$ state. We state that the conjecture is a result of the proof of the conjecture.

## 9. More on Slavnov Products of Spin Chains and KP Hierarchy Tau Functions

**Authors:** Thiago Araujo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21166v1)

**Summary:**

Connections between classical and quantum integrable systems are analyzed from the viewpoint of Slavnov products of Bethe states. Building on recent results on the structure of rational and trigonometric models, we show that, provided certain conditions are satisfied, the Slavnov product of a given model can be interpreted as a tau function of the KP hierarchy. We also prove that their homogeneous limit can be systematically expressed as a Wronskian of functions related to the eigenvalues of the transfer matrices.

## 10. Factorization of positive definite kernels. Correspondences:   $C^{*}$-algebraic and operator valued context vs scalar valued kernels

**Authors:** Palle E. T. Jorgensen, James Tian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21037v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce and study a class of generalized positive definite kernels. These kernels encode operator-valued correlations governed by the algebraic structure of $\mathfrak{A}$ We show that every $K$ admits a Stinespring-type factorization $K(s,t)(a)$. In analogy with the Radon--Nikodym theory for CP maps, we characterize kernel domination $K\leq L$ in terms of a positive operator $A\in\pi_L'

## 11. Through and beyond moments, entropies and Fisher information measures:   new informational functionals and inequalities

**Authors:** Razvan Gabriel Iagar, David Puertas-Centeno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21015v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce new classes of informational functionals, called upper moments and down-Fisher measures. The generalized Beta probability density maximizes (or minimizes) the upper-moments when the moment is fixed. We apply these structured inequalities to systematically establish new and sharp upper bounds for the main classical informational products such as moment-entropy, Stam, or Cram\'er-Rao like products. Other relevant properties, such as regularity under scaling changes or monotonicity with respect to the parameter, are studied.

## 12. Construction of Metaplectic Representations of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$   and Twisted Magnetic Translations

**Authors:** Emmanuel Floratos, Kimon Manolas, Ioannis Tsohantjis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20983v1)

**Summary:**

Unitary metaplectic representations are necessary to describe evolution of $2^n-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving $n$ qubits. We construct the general matrix form of such representations, together with appropriately defined magnetic translations based on the diagonal subgroup of the tensor product of the finite Heisenberg group. It is shown that in order for the meetingaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved $n-qubit Hilbert spaces, from $2 ^n$ to $2^{2n}$, is necessary.

## 13. Integrable Non-Holonomic Constraints and Gauge Fixing in Classical Field   Theory

**Authors:** Ben Bert, William A. Horowitz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20684v1)

**Summary:**

The usual method for gauge fixing in classical and quantum field theories fails for general gauges that depend on the derivatives of the fields, such as the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges. The point of failure occurs at the use of the transposition rule in the derivation of the equations of motion from the extremization of the action. We define the concept of integrability of non-holonomic constraints in field theory and prove that the usual Transposition rule holds for theories with these constraints.

## 14. LSZ ghostbusters in the quadratic gravity stage

**Authors:** O. P. Santillán

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597v1)

**Summary:**

The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided. In order to be sure that unitarity is not violated, one should derived the LSZ rules for the model and check the absence of negative contributions to the $S$ matrix. This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit.
