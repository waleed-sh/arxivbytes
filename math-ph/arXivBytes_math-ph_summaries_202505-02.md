## 0. Axially symmetric collapses in the 2-D Benjamin-Ono equation

**Authors:** Joseph O. Oloo, Victor I. Shrira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00689v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00689v1)

**Summary:**

We study the nonlinear dynamics of localized perturbations within the framework of the essentially two-dimensional generalization of the Benjamin-Ono equation (2D-BO) In the vicinity of the collapse singularity, the solution becomes axially-symmetric, whatever its initial shape. The value of the free parameter $ {\lambda}$ in the self-similar solution is specified by fitting it to the numerical simulation of the initial problem of the evolution of an initial perturbation.

## 1. Quantum Circuit Overhead

**Authors:** Oskar Słowik, Piotr Dulian, Adam Sawicki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00683v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00683v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a measure for evaluating the efficiency of finite universal quantum gate sets. We identify the optimal choices of such completions for both finite subgroups. The famous T gate is a highly non-optimal choice for the completion of the Clifford gate set, even among the gates of order 8. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ($T$-)QCO by extensive numerical calculations of its upper bounds. The results suggest that, in terms of the upper bounds on the $T$-QCO, the famous T Gate is a Highly Non-Optimal Choice.

## 2. Scaling limit of a weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process in the   framework of regularity structures

**Authors:** Ruojun Huang, Konstantin Matetski, Hendrik Weber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00621v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that a parabolically rescaled and suitably renormalised height function of a weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process on a circle converges to the Cole-Hopf solution of the KPZ equation. This is an analogue of the celebrated result by Bertini and Giacomin from 1997. The main technical challenge addressed in this work is the renormalisation procedure which requires a subtle analysis of regularity preserving discrete convolution operators. Our analysis relies on discretisation framework for regularity structures developed by Erhard and Hairer.

## 3. An explicit description of the Kähler-Einstein metrics of   Guenancia-Hamenstädt

**Authors:** Jean-François Lafont, Barry Minemyer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00517v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein metric is a variation of the hyperbolic metric written in polar coordinates. Fine and Premoselli (FP) constructed the first examples of manifolds that do not admit a locally symmetric metric but do admit a negatively curved Einstein metric. In this article we generalize the construction of FP to the complexhyperbolic setting and show that this yields a negativelyCurved Einstein metric that asymptotically approaches the metric of GH. The GH metrics are realized on complex hyperBolic branched covers constructed by Stover and Toledo.

## 4. Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory - Gravitational Anyonic   Edge Modes

**Authors:** Thomas G. Mertens, Qi-Feng Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3D gravity to topological entanglement entropy. We propose a minimalFactorization map.

## 5. A General Model for Linearly Polarized Optical Vector Beams

**Authors:** Jonathan Nichols, Frank Bucholtz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00471v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an approach for deriving a broad class of propagation models for inhomogeneously, linearly polarized beams. Our formulation leverages a complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian energy density. We further show that the definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential holds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomeospereously polarized beams, and that phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent from an energy perspective. We also show how the complex Scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle as a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangians.

## 6. On the structure of big bang singularities in spatially homogenous   solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations

**Authors:** Hans Ringström

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00429v1)

**Summary:**

This article looks at the structure of big bang singularities in spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations. We prove that solutions are either vacuum or matter dominated, depending on whether the limit of an expansion normalised normal derivative is zero or not. Initial data on the singularity thus play a central role in the analysis; they both parameterise developments and give optimal asymptotic information. However, the article contains substantial additional information, such as, e.g., the construction of a large class of spatially locally homogenous solutions that can be demonstrated to be globally non-linearly stable.

## 7. Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum type estimates for the Pauli and magnetic   Schrödinger operator in dimension two

**Authors:** Matthias Baur, Hynek Kovarik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00428v1)

**Summary:**

We prove a Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum type inequality for the number of negative eigenvalues of Pauli operators in dimension two. The resulting upper bound is sharp both in the weak as well as in the strong coupling limit. We also derive different upper bounds for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators. The nature of the two estimates depends on whether or not the spin-orbit coupling is taken into account. We conclude that the upper bound for the Pauli operator limit is sharp in both the weak and strong cases.

## 8. On a time-resolved interpretation of the Husimi function

**Authors:** Ralph Sabbagh, Olga Movilla Miangolarra, Tryphon T. Georgiou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00245v1)

**Summary:**

In this Letter, we interpret the Husimi function as the conditional probability density of continuously measuring a stream of constant position and momentum outcomes, indefinitely. This gives rise to an alternative definition that naturally extends to an arbitrary collection of self-adjoint operators without reference to coherent states. Ultimately, the proposed paradigm generates positive representations of quantum states as conditional densities, on both finite and infinite time classical experiments, as expectations of a fundamental operator, the Gaussian semigroup. This definition recovers the Husmi distribution for a spin-half particle when monitoring the three Pauli matrices, as well as Born's rule for quantum measurement.
