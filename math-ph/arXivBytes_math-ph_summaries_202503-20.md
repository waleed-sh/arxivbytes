## 0. Quantized Coulomb branch of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory and   spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type

**Authors:** Yutaka Yoshida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15446v1)

**Summary:**

We study BPS loop operators in a 4d gauge theory with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation. We conjecture that the quantized Coulomb branch of the 4d $Sp(N)$ gauge theory is isomorphic to the spherical DAHA of the double affine Hecke algebra. As evidence for this conjecture, we demonstrate that the Quantization of an 't Hooft loop agrees with the Koornwinder operator.

## 1. Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of   recent progress

**Authors:** Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15398v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15398v1)

**Summary:**

Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N>2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.

## 2. The importance of being empty: a spectral approach to Hopfield neural   networks with diluted examples

**Authors:** Elena Agliari, Alberto Fachechi, Domenico Luongo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15353v1)

**Summary:**

We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings. We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground- Truths. We determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbians can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.

## 3. Higher order tacnodes in a free fermionic model

**Authors:** Andrea Maroncelli, Jean-Marie Stéphan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15344v1)

**Summary:**

A free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping is investigated. The model is known to give rise to limit shapes and arctic curves for large time. Fluctuations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. The authors find a novel higher order tac node kernel governing them. They also study the behavior of correlations close to the merger point, and find the corresponding density profile. They conclude that the model can be used as a basis for a new type of super-fermion.

## 4. System of stochastic interacting wave functions that model quantum   measurements

**Authors:** Carlos M. Mora

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15280v1)

**Summary:**

Using arguments of the theory of quantum measurements we derive a system of stochastic interacting wave functions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to this system under conditions general enough for the applications. The mixed state generated by the SIWF at any time does not depend on the initial state, and satisfies the diffusive quantum master equation, which is also known as Belavkin equation. We present two physical examples. In one, theSIWF becomes a model of a circuit quantum electrodynamics. In the other, we deal with a model with unbounded Hamiltonians.

## 5. Gibbs Properties of Equilibrium States

**Authors:** Mirmukhsin Makhmudov, Evgeny Verbitskiy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15263v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the problem of equivalence of Gibbs states and equilibrium states for continuous potentials on full shift spaces. Sinai, Bowen, Ruelle and others established equivalence under various assumptions on the potential. In this paper, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence. We also show that every ergodic measure is an equilibrium state for some continuous potential. This means that the equivalences can occur only under some appropriate conditions on the possible function. The equivalence can only occur if the potential function is a full shift space.

## 6. Quasiparticle solutions to the 1D nonlocal Fisher--KPP equation with a   fractal time derivative in the weak diffusion approximation

**Authors:** A. V. Shapovalov, S. A. Siniukov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15099v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing quasiparticle-like asymptotic solutions within the weak diffusion approximation for the generalized population Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piskunov (Fisher--KPP) equation. This approach is based on the semiclassical approximation and the principles of the Maslov method. The fractal time derivative is introduced in the framework of $F^{\alpha}$-calculus.

## 7. Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains

**Authors:** Alex Bols, Wojciech De Roeck, Michiel De Wilde, Bruno de O. Carvalho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15088v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15088v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}. This allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalences classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmeries provides an isomorphism with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1)$, consistent with previous conjectures.

## 8. Kink breathers on a traveling wave background in the defocusing modified   Korteweg--de Vries equation

**Authors:** Lynnyngs Kelly Arruda, Dmitry E. Pelinovsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15076v1)

**Summary:**

We characterize a general traveling periodic wave of the defocusing mKdV (modified Korteweg--de Vries) equation by using a quotient of products of Jacobi's elliptic theta functions. Compared to the standing periodic wave, these solutions are special cases of Riemann's theta function of genus two. Based on our characterization, we derive a new two-parameter solution form which defines a general three-parameters solution form with the scaling transformation.

## 9. Instability of the peaked traveling wave in a local model for shallow   water waves

**Authors:** Fábio Natali, Dmitry E. Pelinovsky, Shuoyang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15071v1)

**Summary:**

The traveling wave with the peaked profile arises in the limit of the family of traveling waves with the smooth profiles. We study the linear and nonlinear stability of the peaked traveling wave by using a local model for shallow water waves, which is related to the Hunter--Saxton equation. By using numerical approximations of the smooth traveling waves and the spectrum of their associated linearized operator, we show that the spectral instability of the peak traveling wave cannot be obtained in the limits of the spectrally stable waves.

## 10. Exact calculation of spectral properties of a particle interacting with   a one-dimensional Fermi gas in optical lattices

**Authors:** Xia-Ji Liu, Hui Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15026v1)

**Summary:**

We use the exact Bethe wavefunctions of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with $N$ spin-up fermions and one spin-down impurity. We present the impurity spectral function as functions of the on-site interaction strength and the filling factor of the Fermi bath. Our exact predictions could be directly examined in cold-atom laboratories by using the radio-frequency spectroscopy and Ramsey spectroscopic. We discuss the origin of Ferm i singularities in the spectral function at small momentum and the emergence of polaron quasiparticles at large momentum near the boundary of Brillouin zone.

## 11. Upper tail large deviations for Brownian motions with one-sided   collisions

**Authors:** Thomas Weiss

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15018v1)

**Summary:**

The system of interacting Brownian motions belongs to the KPZ universality class, with multi-point asymptotics having been derived in previous works. In this paper we show upper tail large deviation principles for all three fundamental initial conditions, including explicit calculation of the rate function. For the periodic case the Lambert-W function, which is already present in the Fredholm determinant formula, also appears in the ratefunction. We conclude that the system of Brownian motion belongs to KPZ.

## 12. Real Eigenvalues of Asymmetric Wishart Matrices: Expected Number, Global   Density and Integrable Structure

**Authors:** Sung-Soo Byun, Kohei Noda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14942v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the real eigenvalues of asymmetric Wishart matrices of size $N. We establish a decomposition structure for the finite-$N$ correlation kernel. We show that the expected number of realeigenvalues is proportional to $N$ in the strongly non-Hermitian regime. We derive the limiting real eigenevalue densities, which recovers the Marchenko-Pastur distribution in the symmetric limit. We conclude that the model reduces to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble.

## 13. Perturbed Fourier Transform Associated with Schrödinger Operators

**Authors:** Shijun Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14888v1)

**Summary:**

We give an exposition on the $L^2$ theory of the perturbed Fourier transform associated with a Schr\"odinger operator $H=-d^2/dx^2 +V$ on the real line. In the case $V$ is a real-valued \mbox{finite} measure, we explicitly define the pert disturbed Fouriertransform for $H$ and obtain an eigenfunction expansion theorem for square integrable functions. Such paradigm has applications in the study of scattering problems in connection with the spectral properties.

## 14. Long-Moody construction of braid group representations and Haraoka's   multiplicative middle convolution for KZ-type equations

**Authors:** Haru Negami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14840v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we establish a correspondence between algebraic and analytic approaches to constructing representations of the braid group $B_n. We use the Katz-Long-Moody construction and multiplicative middle convolution for Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ)-type equations, respectively. We show that this construction preserves unitarity relative to a Hermitian matrix. We establish an algorithm to determine the signature of the Hermitsian matrix $\widetilde{H}.

## 15. A Constrained Saddle Search Approach for Constructing Singular and   Flexible Bar Frameworks

**Authors:** Xuenan Li, Mihnea Leonte, Christian D. Santangelo, Miranda Holmes-Cerfon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14807v1)

**Summary:**

Singularity analysis is essential in robot kinematics, as singular configurations cause loss of control and kinematic indeterminacy. This paper models singularities in bar frameworks as saddle points on constrained manifolds. Using our constrained saddle search approach, we identify previously unknown singular and flexible bar frameworks, providing new insights into singular robotics design and analysis. We define the squared length of the free edge as an energy functional and show that its local saddle points correspond to singular and Flexible frameworks.
