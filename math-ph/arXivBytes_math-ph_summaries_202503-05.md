## 0. Large deviations of SLE(0+) variants in the capacity parameterization

**Authors:** Osama Abuzaid, Eveliina Peltola

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02795v1)

**Summary:**

We prove large deviation principles (LDPs) for full chordal, radial, and multichordal SLE(0+) curves. The rate function is given by the appropriate variant of the Loewner energy. There are two key novelties in the present work. First, we strengthen the topology in the known chordal LDPs. Second, we address the radial case, which requires in part different methods from the chordal case, due to the different topological setup.

## 1. Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles

**Authors:** Fabrice Delbary

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02736v1)

**Summary:**

The geometry of foams has become an important research domain, in mathematics, physics, material sciences and biology. Most of the simplest geometrical observations of bubble clusters have long resisted rigorous mathematical proofs. We propose to answer the latter numerically with simple numerical examples of clusters with bubbles having the topology of a torus, a triple torus or a fivefold torus. For instance, it is unknown if immiscible fluids have to fulfill Plateau's laws, although it is proven to be for surface tensions close to unity.

## 2. The 18-cycle in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$: Combined Linear Local   Passage and Numerical Simulation

**Authors:** Johannes Buchner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02684v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we find an example for a periodic heteroclinic chain that allows Takens Linearization at all base points. We then show that the combined cinear local passage at the 18-cycle is a contraction. We conclude with a discussion on how to proceed further in studying Bianchi cosmologies, and also discuss directions for future research in inhomogeneous (PDE-) cosmological models. The appendix contains symbolic and computations done by Mathematica for examples discussed throughout the text.

## 3. $C^{1}$-Stable-Manifolds for Periodic Heteroclinic Chains in Bianchi IX:   Symbolic Computations and Statistical Properties

**Authors:** Johannes Buchner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02664v1)

**Summary:**

There are no heteroclinic chains in Bianchi IX with constant continued fraction development that allow Takens-Linearization at all of their base points. Geometrically speaking, this excludes "symmetric" chains with the same number of "bounces" near all of the 3 Taub Points. The result shows that we have to require some "asymmetry" in the bounces in order to allow for Takens Linearization. We conclude by discussing the statistical properties of those solutions, including their topological and measure-theoretic genericity.

## 4. Mode stability of blow-up for wave maps in the absence of symmetry

**Authors:** Max Weissenbacher, Herbert Koch, Roland Donninger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02632v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02632v1)

**Summary:**

The wave maps equation in three spatial dimensions with a spherical target admits an explicit blow-up solution. Numerical studies suggest this solution captures the genericblow-up behaviour in the backward light cone of the singularity. In this work, we establish the mode stability of this blow- up solution in the forward light cone. We then use the quasi-solution method of Costin-Donninger-Glogi\'{c} to show the absence of non-zero smooth solutions for the resulting system of ODEs.

## 5. Row and column detection complexities of character tables

**Authors:** Adrian Padellaro, Sanjaye Ramgoolam, Rak-Kyeong Seong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02543v1)

**Summary:**

Character tables of finite groups and closely related commutative algebras have been investigated recently using new perspectives. Two important elements in these new perspectives are physically motivated definitions of quantum complexity and a notion of row-column duality. We observe regularities that arise in the statistical averages over small character tables and propose corresponding conjectures for arbitrarily large character tables. We define row and column versions of detection complexities for character tables, and investigate the relation between these complexities under the exchange of rows and columns.

## 6. Linear Instability of the Prandtl Equations via Hypergeometric Functions   and the Harmonic Oscillator

**Authors:** Francesco De Anna, Joshua Kortum

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02417v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02417v1)

**Summary:**

We establish a deep connection between the Prandtl equations linearised around a quadratic shear flow, confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, and the Schr\"odinger operator. We entirely determine the space of solutions in terms of Kummer's functions. We show finally that the obtained analytical formulation of the velocity align with previous numerical simulations in the literature. The results are published in the open-access issue of the Journal of Applied Mathematics, published by the University of California, San Diego.

## 7. Non-split superstrings of dimension $(1|2)$

**Authors:** Dimitry Leites, Alexander S. Tikhomirov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02416v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02416v1)

**Summary:**

Any supermanifold diffeomorphic to one whose structure sheaf is the sheaf of sections of a~ vector bundle over the underlying manifold is called split. Gaw\c{e}dzki (1977) and Batchelor (1979) were the first to prove that any smooth superman ifold is split. In 1981, P.~Green, and Palamodov, found examples of non-split analytic super manifolds and described obstructions to splitness.

## 8. Charges in light cones and quenched infrared radiation

**Authors:** Detlev Buchholz, Fabio Ciolli, Giuseppe Ruzzi, Ezio Vasselli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02342v1)

**Summary:**

The creation of electrically charged states and the resulting electromagnetic fields are considered in space-time regions in which such experiments can actually be carried out. The results show that the restrictions of operations and observations to light cones, which are dictated by the arrow of time, amount to a Lorentz-invariant infrared cutoff. This is consistent with the fact that there is no evidence for the existence of longitudinal photons. They are quenched and the observed radiation can be described by states in the Fock space of photons.

## 9. Streams, Graphs and Global Attractors of Dynamical Systems on Locally   Compact Spaces

**Authors:** Roberto De Leo, James A. Yorke

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02262v1)

**Summary:**

A semiflow $F$ can have many global trapping regions but, if it has a global attractor, this is unique. We modify here our original definition and we say that $F $ has compact dynamics if it is connected to $G$. We show that most of the qualitative properties of $ F$ are inherited by the restriction $F_G$ of $F$, and that, in case of Conley's chains stream of $C$, the behavior of $f$ and $G$ coincide.

## 10. Polynomial Toda maps are transfer matrices

**Authors:** Christian Remling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02153v1)

**Summary:**

We consider entire matrix functions $A(z)$ taking values in $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb C)$. These map pairs of Herglotz functions by acting pointwise as linear fractional transformations. We then prove that if $A$ induces a Toda map, then $A $ is essentially a transfer matrix. The main examples of such Toda maps are provided by transfer matrices of differential and difference operators and by the cocycles associated with the classical integrable systems.
