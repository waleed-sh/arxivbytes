## 0. Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability

**Authors:** Zhao Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773v1)

**Summary:**

The existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the three-local charge.

## 1. Extended Scalar Particle Solutions in Black String Spacetimes with   Anisotropic Quintessence

**Authors:** M. L. Deglmann, B. V. Simão, C. C. Barros Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765v1)

**Summary:**

We present new solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar particle in a black string spacetime immersed in an anisotropic quintessence fluid surrounded by a cloud of strings. We investigate the cases when $\alpha_{Q} = 0,\,1/2, \,1$, encompassing both black hole and horizonless scenarios. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics of scalar particles in this complex spacetime and the potential impact of dark energy on quantum systems.

## 2. Orbifolds, higher dagger structures, and idempotents

**Authors:** Nils Carqueville, Tim Lüders

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17764v1)

**Summary:**

The orbifold/condensation completion procedure of defect topological quantum field theories can be seen as carrying out a lattice or state sum model construction internal to an ambient theory. In this paper, we propose a conceptual algebraic description of orbifolds/condensations for arbitrary tangential structures in terms of higher dagger structures and higher idempotents. We provide several examples ofhigher dagger categories, such as those associated to state sum models, (orbifolds of) Landau--Ginzburg models, and truncated affine Rozansky--Witten models.

## 3. One-dimensional $q$-state modified Potts model and its thermodynamic   functions

**Authors:** Hasan Akin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17616v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates a one-dimensional modified Potts model influenced by an external magnetic field. By leveraging the transfer matrix method, exact expressions are derived for key thermodynamic quantities. Numerical analyses explore how these thermodynamic functions vary with relevant parameters. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the model's thermodynamic characteristics and highlight its potential applications across various disciplines. It also offers insights into the system's behavior, including the asymptotic properties of these quantities in the limiting cases.

## 4. Free field realization of the quantum toroidal algebra of   $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ with general levels

**Authors:** Zitao Chen, Xiang-Mao Ding

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17508v1)

**Summary:**

We present a unified free field realization of representations for the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ with arbitrary levels, constructed using six free boson fields. This realization arises from a specialized factorization of the structure function within the defining relations of the algebra. We further develop intertwining operators for the algebra of $$ $ '$ -$ -''$' -'$$'$ '$' $'$-'$ $'#' $ '#' #' $#'$ #'$#'

## 5. Microscopic derivation of the stationary Chern-Simons-Schrödinger   equation for almost-bosonic anyons

**Authors:** Alireza Ataei, Douglas Lundholm, Théotime Girardot

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17488v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we consider the $N$-body Hamiltonian describing the microscopic structure of a quantum gas of almost-bosonic anyons. We study a physically well-motivated ansatz for a sequence of trial states, consisting of Jastrow repulsive short-range correlations and a condensate. In the limit $N \to \infty$, while taking the relative size of the anyons to zero and the total magnetic flux $2\pi\beta$ to remain finite, we rigorously derive the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger/average-field-Pauli effective energy density functional.

## 6. On soliton resolution to Cauchy problem of the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii   equation

**Authors:** Shou-Fu Tian, Jia-Fu Tong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17465v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17465v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the Cauchy problem for the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation, which is a model instrumental in characterizing the soliton dynamics within spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. Compared with the previous work, our asymptotic error accuracy has been improved from $O ($t) to $O(t) ($t-3/4) ($N$-soliton) and $O (t-4/4).

## 7. Lectures on measurement in quantum field theory

**Authors:** Christopher J. Fewster

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17437v1)

**Summary:**

Introducing measurement theory for QFT in possibly curved spacetimes. Topics include: a brief introduction to algebraic QFT, measurement schemes, state updates, multiple measurements and the resolution of Sorkin's "impossible measurement" problem. Examples using suitable theories based on Green hyperbolic operators are given. The interpretational significance of the framework is briefly considered. The basic style is to give details relating to QFT while taking for granted various facts from the theory of globallyhyperbolic spacetime.

## 8. Baryogenesis in Conformally Flat Spacetimes

**Authors:** Felix Finster, Marco van den Beld-Serrano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17434v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze a baryogenesis mechanism originating from the theory of causal fermion systems. An explicit formula is derived for the rate of baries in conformally flat spacetimes. It sets the ground for concrete, quantitative predictions for specific cosmological spacetime. Our analysis covers Friedmann-Lema,.tre-Robertson-Walker, Milne and Milne-like spacetIMEs. We conclude that the baries of these sp acetimes can be predicted using the regularizing vector field.

## 9. The KP equation of plane elastodynamics

**Authors:** Harold Berjamin, Michel Destrade, Giuseppe Saccomandi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17411v1)

**Summary:**

The propagation of nonlinear and dispersive waves in various materials can be described by the well-known Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation. In this paper, we show that the KP equation can be used to describe the in-plane motion of compressible elastic solids with dispersion. A modified KP equation with cubic nonlinearity is also obtained in the case of incompressible solids. In particular, both equations admit solitary wave solutions.

## 10. Classical Estimation of the Free Energy and Quantum Gibbs Sampling from   the Markov Entropy Decomposition

**Authors:** Samuel O. Scalet, Angela Capel, Anirban N. Chowdhury, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi, Isaac H. Kim, Arkin Tikku

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17405v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the Markov Entropy Decomposition, a classical convex relaxation algorithm introduced by Poulin and Hastings to approximate the free energy in quantum spin lattices. We identify a sufficient condition for its convergence, namely the decay of the effective interaction. We then use this fact to devise a rounding scheme that maps the solution of the convex Relaxation to a global state. We show that the scheme can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, thus proving efficiency of quantum Gibbs sampling.

## 11. Defects in unidimensional structures

**Authors:** Mewen Crespo, Guy Casale, Loïc Le Marrec, Patrizio Neff

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17340v1)

**Summary:**

In a previous work of the first authors, a non-holonomic model, generalising the micromorphic models and allowing for curvature (disclinations) to arise from the kinematic values, was presented. In the present paper, a generalisation of the classical models of Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko bending beams based on the mentioned work is proposed. The former is still composed of only one unidimensional scalar field, while the later introduces a third unid dimensional field, correcting the second order terms.

## 12. Quantum Corner VOA and the Super Macdonald Polynomials

**Authors:** Panupong Cheewaphutthisakun, Jun'ichi Shiraishi, Keng Wiboonton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17326v1)

**Summary:**

We establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the super MacDonald polynoms. We show that under a map the correlation function of the quantum currents coincides with the Sergeev-Vselov super Macdonald polynomial.

## 13. Higher-Spin Currents and Flows in Auxiliary Field Sigma Models

**Authors:** Daniele Bielli, Christian Ferko, Michele Galli, Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17294v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17294v1)

**Summary:**

We study local, higher-spin conserved currents in integrable $2d$ sigma models that have been deformed via coupling to auxiliary fields. These currents generate integrability-preserving flows introduced by Smirnov and Zamolodchikov. Part of our analysis shows that the class of AF deformations can be extended by allowing the interaction function to depend on a larger set of variables than has previously been considered. We give perturbative solutions for spin-$3$ SZ flows in any member of our unified class ofAF models with underlying $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ algebra.
