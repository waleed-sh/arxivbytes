## 0. Characterization of Gaussian Tensor Ensembles

**Authors:** Remi Bonnin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02814v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we define the Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic Tensor Ensembles for notions of real symmetric, hermitian and self-dual hermitsian tensors. We give a basis of invariant polynomials for orthogonal,. unitary and symplectic transformations. We prove a Maxwell-type theorem for these Gaussian tensor distributions unifying and extending the ones known for vectors and matrices. We conclude with a proof of the Maxwell- type theorem.

## 1. Sharp stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Second-Order   and Curl-Free Field Cases

**Authors:** Anh Xuan Do, Nguyen Lam, Guozhen Lu, Lingxiao Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02758v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02758v1)

**Summary:**

Using techniques from harmonic analysis, we derive several sharp stability estimates for the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We also present the explicit lower and upper bounds for the sharp stability constants and compute their exact limits when the dimension $N\rightarrow\infty$. Our proofs rely on spherical harmonics decomposition and Fourier analysis, differing significantly from existing approaches in the literature. Our results substantially improve the stability constants of the second-order Heisenburg Uncertainties Principle.

## 2. Exceptional, but Separate: Precursors to Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

**Authors:** Lewis Hill, Julius T. Gohsrich, Alekhya Ghosh, Jacob Fauman, Pascal Del'Haye, Flore K. Kunst

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02691v1)

**Summary:**

Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and exceptional points (EPs) are often assumed to be inherently linked. Here we investigate the intricate relationship between SSB and specific classes of EPs across three distinct, real-world scenarios in nonlinear optics. Our results highlight the need for careful analysis of assumed correlations betweenSSB and EPs in both theoretical and applied contexts. They deepen our understanding of nonlinear dynamics in optical systems and prompt a broader reconsideration of contexts where EPs and SSB are thought to be interdependent.

## 3. $f(R,\mathcal{G})$-cosmological dynamics in the FLRW background

**Authors:** Nikolaos Dimakis, Alex Giacomini, Genly Leon, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Ekaterina Pozdeeva, Sergey Vernov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe.

## 4. Faithful and secure distributed quantum sensing under general-coherent   attacks

**Authors:** G. Bizzarri, M. Barbieri, M. Manrique, M. Parisi, F. Bruni, I. Gianani, M. Rosati

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02620v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02620v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum metrology and cryptography can be combined in a distributed and/or remote sensing setting. distant end-users with limited quantum capabilities can employ quantum states, transmitted by a quantum-powerful provider via a quantum network, to perform quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in a private fashion. Previous works on the subject have been limited by restricted assumptions on the capabilities of a potential eavesdropper and the use of abort-based protocols that prevent a simple practical realization. Here we introduce, theoretically analyze, and experimentally demonstrate single- and two-way protocols for distributed sensing.

## 5. The five-twist identity for Feynman periods

**Authors:** Oliver Schnetz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02578v1)

**Summary:**

We prove a new identity for Feynman periods that acts on five-vertex cuts of completed primitive Feyn man graphs. It is shown that in $\phi^4$ theory this identity is independent from existing identities which are the twist, the Fourier identity and the Fouriers split. We show that this identity can be used to prove other identities in the same way as the twist and Fourier split. The identity can also be applied to other types of graphs, such as the graph-like graph and graph-shaped graph.

## 6. Landau-Ginzburg-Saito theory for descendant Gromov-Witten theory on   projective line

**Authors:** Vyacheslav Lysov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02556v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02556v1)

**Summary:**

The correlation functions for the descendants in the Landau-Ginzburg-Saito theory obey puncture, divisor, dilaton, and topological recursion relations. We prove that the LGS correlation functions of the mirror observables are equal to the GW invariants with descendants. We formulate the map between the descendant observables in the GW theory on the projective line and the descendant observable in the mirror LGS theory. We show that the correlation functions obey punctured and divisored relations.

## 7. The Multidimensional Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform: Theoretical   Analysis and Applications

**Authors:** Sarga Varghese, Gita Rani Mahato, Manab Kundu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02526v1)

**Summary:**

The quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT) is a generalization of several well-known integral transforms. This paper introduces the multidimensional QPFT and investigates its theoretical properties, including Parseval's identity and inversion theorems. Generalized convolutions and correlation for multiple variables, extending the conventional convolution for single-variable functions, are proposed within the QP FT setting. A Boas-type theorem for the multi-dimensional Q PFT is established.

## 8. About diffusion equations in bounded systems

**Authors:** F. Sattin, D. F. Escande

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02496v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02496v1)

**Summary:**

Differential equations need boundary conditions (BC's) for their solution. We show that this case is very peculiar. DE's generally arise as long-wavelength limit out of a stochastic picture of microscopic dynamics. They are justified only on a statistical basis, provide accurate pictures of the system's evolution only over large enough length and time scales. In realistic cases, the width of the interface between the interior and exterior of a system is much smaller than transport scales, providing effectively a discontinuity and therefore a decorrelation.

## 9. Convergence of Schr√∂dinger operators on domains with scaled resonant   potentials

**Authors:** Vladimir Lotoreichik, Olaf Post

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02480v1)

**Summary:**

We consider Schr\"odinger operators on a bounded, smooth domain of dimension $d \ge 2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions and a properly scaled potential. Our aim is to analyse the convergence of these operators as the scaling parameter tends to zero. If the scaled potential is resonant, the limit in strong resolvent sense is a Robin Laplacian with boundary coefficient expressed in terms of the mean curvature of the boundary. We conjecture that we can drop the non-negativity assumption in thenon-resonant case.

## 10. Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories

**Authors:** Alexey Golovnev, Kirill Russkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468v1)

**Summary:**

 path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the same level of the total Hamiltonian with the primary constraints only. The idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works, we argue. We conclude by saying that there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints.

## 11. The Quantum Random Energy Model is the Limit of Quantum $ p $-Spin   Glasses

**Authors:** Anouar Kouraich, Chokri Manai, Simone Warzel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02458v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the free energy of a class of spin glass models with $ p$-spin interactions in a transverse magnetic field. As $ p \to \infty $, the infinite system-size free energy is proven to converge to that of the quantum random energy model. This is accomplished by combining existing analytical techniques with the description of the typical geometry of extreme negative deviations of the classical $ p $-spin glass. We also review properties of the corresponding classical free energy and conjectures addressing $ 1/p $-corrections in the quantum case.

## 12. Spectral gap of the KMP and other stochastic exchange models on   arbitrary graphs

**Authors:** Seonwoo Kim, Matteo Quattropani, Federico Sau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02400v1)

**Summary:**

We present a simple strategy to derive universal bounds on the spectral gap of reversible stochastic exchange models on arbitrary graphs. The Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model, the harmonic process (HP), and the immediate exchange model (IEM) are all examples that fall into this class. Our upper and lower bounds depend only on two features: worst-case linear statistics and a kinetic factor, which is, in essence, graph-independent. For the three aforementioned examples, these bounds are sharp, and even saturate to an identity for HP and IEM in some log-concave regimes.

## 13. Quantum ergodicity for Dirichlet-truncated operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$

**Authors:** Hongyi Cao, Shengquan Xiang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02339v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we prove quantum ergodicity (a form of delocalization for eigenfunctions) for the Dirichlet truncations of the adjacency matrix. We also extend the result to the cases of finite range observables and periodic Schr\"odinger operators with periods of length at most two. This work partially answers a question asked by McKenzie and Sabri (Comm. Math. Phys. 403(3), 1477--1509(2023)).

## 14. Symplectic Geometry of Higgs Moduli and the Hilbert Scheme of Points

**Authors:** Zelin Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02334v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the isomorphism between the moduli space of certain parabolic Higgs bundles over an elliptic curve and the Hilbert scheme of n points of the cotangent bundle of the elliptic curves is a symplectomorphism with respect to their natural symplectic structures. We also show that this is the case for certain types of elliptic¬†curves. We conclude that the¬†isomorphism¬†is a¬†sympathetic¬†form of the¬†Higgs¬†scheme.
