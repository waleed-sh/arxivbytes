## 0. The Vlasov Bivector: A Parameter-Free Approach to Vlasov Kinematics

**Authors:** Finlay Gunneberg, Jonathan Gratus, Harvey Stanfield

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16104v1)

**Summary:**

Plasma kinetics is conventionally performed on the mass shell, a 7--dimensional time-phase space with a Vlasov vector field. We replace this with a bivector on an 8--dimensional sub-bundle of the tangent bundle. This has a number of advantages, which include working for lightlike and ultra-relativistic particles, non metric connections, and metric-free and premetric theories. We discuss the stress-energy tensor needed for the Einstein-Vlasov system.

## 1. Degree of freedom count in linear gauge invariant PDE systems

**Authors:** Simon Lyakhovich, Dmitri Piontkovski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein proposed a definition of the strength of such a theory and its degrees of freedom (DoF) based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the system. Here, we apply commutative algebra methods to this problem. Two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF. We prove another explicit formula for the DoF in terms of gauge symmetries and identities for homogeneous and certain more general systems.

## 2. Liouville Brownian motion and quantum cones in dimension $d > 2$

**Authors:** Federico Bertacco, Ewain Gwynne

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15936v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15936v1)

**Summary:**

For $d > 2$ we study the Liouville Brownian motion associated with the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field. We compute its spectral dimension, i.e., the short-time asymptotics of the heat kernel along the diagonal. We construct the higher-dimensional analogue of the $\beta$-quantum cone for $Q = d/\gamma + \gamma/2$. We prove that the law of the $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-Quantum cone is invariant under shifts along the trajectories of the associated Liouvillian motion.

## 3. Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds

**Authors:** Rutwig Campoamor-Stursberg, Alessio Marrani, Michel Rausch de Traubenberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15892v1)

**Summary:**

Any Lie group manifold can be smoothly deformed into a 'soft' group manifold. The deformation is based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein. We show how to construct an infinite-dimensional(infinite-rank) generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $%G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to the deformed $G_c $ manifold.

## 4. On the level lines of two-layer symmetric potentials

**Authors:** A. Ya. Maltsev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15867v1)

**Summary:**

Two-dimensional potentials play an important role in the physics of two-layer systems. Potentials of this type are quasiperiodic and can also be considered as a model of random potentials on a plane. The description of level lines of such potentials is a special case of the Novikov problem for potentials with four qu asiperiods. The potentials under consideration also have their own clearly expressed specificity, which makes them very interesting for research from a variety of points of view.

## 5. Hydrodynamic limit for an active-passive exclusion process

**Authors:** Deyue Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15862v1)

**Summary:**

The collective non-equilibrium dynamics of multi-component mixtures of interacting active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles have garnered great interest in the physics community. In this work, we consider a lattice gas model of active-passive particle mixtures with exclusion. We derive the hydrodynamic equations governing the particle densities. Due to the presence of two types of particles with continuous-valued orientations, further generalizations of non- gradient decomposition and spectral gap estimation are necessitated.

## 6. Uncertainty principles on $C^{*}$-algebras

**Authors:** Saptak Bhattacharya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15844v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we prove some uncertainty bounds for states on a $C^*$-algebra. We generalize Robertson's Standard Uncertainty Principle to this setting. We also prove some other uncertainty principles for which the lower bound doesn't vanish for an odd number of observables. We give a short, elementary proof of some of the principles in the paper. The paper is published by the University of California, Los Angeles. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details.

## 7. Exponential Control of Excitations for Trapped BEC in the   Gross-Pitaevskii Regime

**Authors:** Nils Behrmann, Christian Brennecke, Simone Rademacher

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15803v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15803v1)

**Summary:**

We consider trapped Bose gases in three dimensions in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime. The low energy states are well known to exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation. We prove exponential control of the number of particles orthogonal to the condensate state, generalizing recent results for translation invariant systems. We conclude that the majority of the particles occupies the same condensates state in the three-dimensional system. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 8. Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation

**Authors:** Yucheng Liu, Biao Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784v1)

**Summary:**

On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a geometrically well-approximable pair. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.   We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles.

## 9. Hard edge asymptotics of correlation functions between singular values   and eigenvalues

**Authors:** Matthias Allard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15765v1)

**Summary:**

For random complex matrices drawn from a bi-unitarily invariant ensemble, a bijection exists between the underlying singular value ensemble and the corresponding eigenvalue ensemble. We show that the latter three ensembles share the same asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin. In the case of Jacobi ensembleles, there exists another hard edge for the singular values, namely the upper edge of their support, which corresponds to a soft edge for their singular value (soft-hard edge)
