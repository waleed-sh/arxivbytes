## 0. Boundary terms in cosmology

**Authors:** Ángel Cuevas, Javier Chagoya, C. Ortiz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679v1)

**Summary:**

In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. We predict a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter. It can be related to a scalar field known as kination.

## 1. Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R,   T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Uttaran Ghosh, Sarbari Guha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we examine the structure scalars formed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor of the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in $f(R,T)$ gravity. The dependence of various physical parameters, such as heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar and effective homogeneous energy density, has been clearly indicated. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure Scalars and the total mass-energy content.

## 2. Locating Extremal Periodic Orbits for the Planar Circular Restricted   Three Body Problem using Polynomial Sum-of-Squares Optimization

**Authors:** Vinay Sharma, Sergei I Chernyshenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23430v1)

**Summary:**

With an increasing interest in the design of long and complex space missions, the search for orbits that require the least amount of fuel is of fundamental interest. This paper develops existing computational models for locating Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems. It then proposes a numerical framework to converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP) in astrodynamics. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs is that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest which is a function of state variables.

## 3. Direct approach to approximate conservation laws

**Authors:** M. Gorgone, G. Inferrera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23390v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, non-variational systems of differential equations containing small terms are considered. A consistent approach for deriving approximate conservation laws through the introduction of approximate Lagrange multipliers is developed. The role of approximate Euler operators is emphasized. Some applications of the procedure are presented. The paper is published by Oxford University Press, London, in the form of an open-access book.

## 4. Quantum cohomology, shift operators, and Coulomb branches

**Authors:** Ki Fung Chan, Kwokwai Chan, Chin Hang Eddie Lam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23340v1)

**Summary:**

Given a complex reductive group and a $G$-representation, there is an associated quantized Coulomb branch algebra. In this paper, we give a new interpretation of this algebra as the largest subalgebra of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian. We also apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing construction for Coulomb branches and derive different generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism. For example, we show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $ G$-action, and $X \to \mathbf{N}$ is an $G-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the

## 5. Graded Paraparticle Algebra of Majorana Fields for Multidimensional   Quantum Computing with Structured Light

**Authors:** Fabrizio Tamburini, Nicolò Leone, Matteo Sanna, Roberto Siagri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23232v1)

**Summary:**

We present a theoretical framework that integrates Majorana's infinite- component relativistic equation within the algebraic structure of paraparticles. We set up deterministic 2-photon gates involving at least two qubits encoded in a single photon without nonlinear effects. This makes feasible general quantum computing pathways exploiting fractional statistics through Nelson's quantum mechanics and implement a novel procedure for error correction in photonic platforms. This approach makes possible to set paraparticle-based quantum information processing, beyond fermions and bosons, using graded qudits.

## 6. Discrete and Continuous Muttalib--Borodin process: Large deviations and   Riemann--Hilbert analysis

**Authors:** Jonathan Husson, Guido Mazzuca, Alessandra Occelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23164v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23164v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviour of plane partitions distributed according to a weighted $q^{Volume}$ Muttalib--Borodin ensemble. We establish a Large Deviation principle for the discrete Muttaliber process, characterising the rate function. Through Riemann--Hilbert analysis, we give an explicit expression for the asymptotic shape of the partition. We conclude by giving an example of a plane partition with a given volume.

## 7. The second order Huang-Yang approximation to the Fermi thermodynamic   pressure

**Authors:** Xuwen Chen, Jiahao Wu, Zhifei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23136v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the 2nd order Huang-Yang approximation for the Fermi pressure of the system. We also establish a conjecture regarding the second order approximation of density by R. Seiringer. Our proof uses frequency localization techniques from the analysis of nonlinear PDEs and does not involve spatial localization or Bosonization. In particular, our method covers the classicalHuang-Yang formula at zero temperature. The formula is valid up to the temperature $T<\rho^{\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}}$, which is, by scaling, also necessary to hold.
