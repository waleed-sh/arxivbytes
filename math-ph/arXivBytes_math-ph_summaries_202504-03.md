## 0. Tensor free probability theory: asymptotic tensor freeness and central   limit theorem

**Authors:** Ion Nechita, Sang-Jun Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01782v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01782v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we generalize Voiculescu's notion of asymptotic free independence. We show that an independent family of local unitary invariant random matrices satisfies a novel form of freeness. We propose a tensor free version of the central limit theorem, which extends and recovers several previous results for tensor products of free variables. We present several applications of these results in the context of random matrix with a tensorsor product structure, such as partial transpositions and tensor embeddings.

## 1. Adaptation of Moreau-Yosida regularization to the modulus of convexity

**Authors:** Markus Penz, Andre Laestadius

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01772v1)

**Summary:**

We study a generalization of Moreau-Yosida regularization that is adapted to the geometry of Banach spaces. The dual space is uniformly convex with modulus of convexity of power type. Important properties for regularized convex functions are given, in particular strong monotonicity of the subdifferential of their convex conjugate and Holder-continuity of their gradient. We show that this generalization can be used to solve the problem of regularizing convex function.

## 2. Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions   and boundary

**Authors:** I. V. Anikin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744v1)

**Summary:**

An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courand-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverseRadon transforms.

## 3. Copositive geometry of Feynman integrals

**Authors:** Bernd Sturmfels, Máté L. Telek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01628v1)

**Summary:**

Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the Copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the coposive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feyn man graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.

## 4. Improvement of fully-implicit two-phase pore-network models by employing   generalized flux functions with additional throat variables

**Authors:** Martin Schneider, Hanchuan Wu, Maziar Veyskarami, Sorin Pop, Rainer Helmig

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01529v1)

**Summary:**

In fully-implicit two-phase pore-network models, developing a well-converged scheme remains a major challenge. This paper addresses these numerical issues by proposing a generalized flux function that establishes a continuous flux expression. It is shown that this approach significantly improves accuracy and ensures the temporal convergence, as demonstrated through various numerical examples. The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Science, published by Oxford University Press, London, UK, on November 14, 2013.

## 5. Global variants of $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theories and Calogero-Moser systems

**Authors:** Jeremías Aguilera Damia, Riccardo Argurio, Antoine Bourget, Valdo Tatitscheff, Romain Vandepopeliere

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01502v1)

**Summary:**

Global variants of four-dimensional gauge theories are specified by their spectrum of genuine Wilson-'t Hooft line operators. We focus on theories of type $A$ and $B_2$ which are closely connected to twisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems. We elucidate the implications for the structure of gapped vacua, the emergent (generalized) symmetries realized in each vacuum, and the action of spontaneously broken modular invariance. We establish, on general grounds, how this gauge-theoretic topological data manifests itself on the integrable system side.

## 6. On the mean-field limit for the Vlasov-Poisson system

**Authors:** Manuela Feistl-Held, Peter Pickl

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01471v1)

**Summary:**

We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in three dimensions. We show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean- field dynamics. The result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particles dynamics with force term arbitrary close to physically relevant Coulomb force.

## 7. The N-Body Problem on Coadjoint Orbits

**Authors:** Holger Dullin, Richard Montgomery

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01272v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the symplectic reduction of the spatial $n$-body problem at non-zero angular momentum is a singular symplectic space. Each stratum is realized as coadjoint orbit in the dual of the Lie algebra of the linear symplectic group $Sp(2n-2)$. We reduce by going to center-of-mass coordinates to reduce by translations and boosts. We begin the paper by showing how Poisson reduction by the Galilean group rewrites Newton's equations as a Lax pair.
