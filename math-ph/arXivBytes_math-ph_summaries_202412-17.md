## 0. QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological   Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow

**Authors:** Ning Bao, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Zhihan Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045v1)

**Summary:**

Non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries can be expressed as quantum path integrals in one higher dimension. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS and topological holography.

## 1. Entanglement Hamiltonian and orthogonal polynomials

**Authors:** Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Riccarda Bonsignori, Viktor Eisler, Gilles Parez, Luc Vinet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12021v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12021v1)

**Summary:**

We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of theEntanglement spectrum and entropy.

## 2. Fermi's golden rule in tunneling models with quantum waveguides   perturbed by Kato class measures

**Authors:** Sylwia Kondej, Kacper Ślipko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12011v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we consider two dimensional quantum system with an infinite waveguide of the width $d$ and a transversally invariant profile. We assume that at a distant $\rho$ there is a perturbation defined by the Kato measure. We show that, under certain conditions, the resolvent of the Hamiltonian has the second sheet pole which reproduces the resonance at $z(\rho)$ We also show that the imaginary component of $z($rho), satisfies Fermi's golden rule which we explicitly derive.

## 3. Semiclassical measure of the propagation between two topological   insulators

**Authors:** Éric Vacelet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11928v1)

**Summary:**

We study the propagation of initial condition in the presence of two topological insulators without magnetic field. The solution is governed by an adiabatic modulation of a Dirac operator with a variable mass. We determine the evolution of the semiclassical measure of the solution with a two-scale Wigner measure method by reducing the Dirac operators to a normal form. The interface is a smooth connected not compact curve without boundaries. The results are published in the Journal of Applied Physics.

## 4. On the Protection Against Noise for Measurement-Based Quantum   Computation

**Authors:** Valentin Vankov Iliev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11903v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum logic gates operate on one qubit to be protected against crosstalk. Here we establish conditions for some pairs of quantum logic gates which operate on a single qubit. For example, the gates can be used to protect against the loss of a qubit if the qubit is on the same side of the gate as the gate on the other side of it.

## 5. Calculating Spectra by Sequential High-Pass Filtering

**Authors:** Dongxiao Zhao, Hussein Aluie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11891v1)

**Summary:**

Sadek & Aluie [Phys. Rev. Fluids, 3, 124610 (2018)] showed that the kernel has to have at least $p$ vanishing moments to extract a power-law spectrum. We show that sequential high-pass filtering allows for extracting steeper spectra with $\alpha<2p+3$ using the same $p $-th order kernel. We demonstrate how second-order structure functions fail to capture spectral peaks because they cannot detect scaling that is too shallow.

## 6. Validity of the stochastic Landau approximation for super-pattern   forming systems with a spatial 1:3 resonance

**Authors:** Anna Logioti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11870v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11870v1)

**Summary:**

The Kuramoto-Shivashinsky like equation serves as a prototype model for so-called super-pattern forming systems with quadratic nonlinearity and additive white noise. It is the goal of this paper to prove error estimates between the associated approximation obtained through this amplitude system and true solutions of the original system. For the description of the bifurcating solutions we derive a system of coupled stochastic Landau equations. The paper is published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics.

## 7. Multi-component Hamiltonian difference operators

**Authors:** Matteo Casati, Daniele Valeri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11772v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study local Hamiltonian operators for multi- component evolutionary differential-difference equations. We address two main problems: the first one is the classification of low order operators for the two- component case. The second problem is the study and the computation of the Poisson cohomology for a two-component (-1,1)-order Hamiltonian operator with degenerate leading term appearing in many integrable differential-Difference systems. The study of its Poisson Cohomology sheds light on its deformation theory and the structure of the bi-Hamiltonian pairs where it is included in.

## 8. Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas

**Authors:** Alexander G. Abanov, Dimitri M. Gangardt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686v1)

**Summary:**

The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.

## 9. Unitary $n$-correlations with restricted support in random matrix theory

**Authors:** Patrik Demjam, N. C. Snaith

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11662v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11662v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the $n$-correlation of eigenvalues of random unitary matrices in the alternative form that is not the tidy determinant common in random matrix theory. The expression is derived from averages of ratios of characteristic polynomials in a method that can be mimicked in number theoretical calculations of the correlations of zeros of $L$-functions. This alternative form was proposed by Conrey and Snaith and derived by them when the test function has support in (-2,2)

## 10. The focusing complex mKdV equation with nonzero background: Large   $N$-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons and related Painlevé-III   hierarchy

**Authors:** Weifang Weng, Guoqiang Zhang, Zhenya Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11581v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11581v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the large-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons of the focusing complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (c-mKdV) equation with nonzero background via the Riemann-Hilbert problems. We also find that the limit function satisfies the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to space $X$ and time $T$, respectively. These results will be useful to understand and apply the Large-order rational sol itons in the nonlinear wave equations.

## 11. A certified classification of first-order controlled coaxial telescopes

**Authors:** Audric Drogoul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11546v1)

**Summary:**

This paper is devoted to an intrinsic geometrical classification of three-mirror telescopes. The problem is formulated as the study of connected components of a semi-algebraic set. Under first order approximation, we give the general expression of the transfer matrix of a general optical system composed by N mirrors. Thanks to this representation, for focal telescopes, we express focal, null Petzval's curvature and telecentricity conditions as polynomials equations depending on the inter-Mirror distances and mirror magnifications.
