## 0. Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?

**Authors:** Dmitry Khudoteplov, Alexei Morozov, Alexey Sleptsov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum knot invariants are a class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebraes might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie alges.

## 1. Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new   characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means

**Authors:** Péter E. Frenkel, Milán Mosonyi, Péter Vrana, Mihály Weiner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379v1)

**Summary:**

The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences. In this paper, we develop an approach to give improved single-copy bounds on the error Exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them.

## 2. Approach to equilibrium in Markovian open quantum systems

**Authors:** Donghao Ouyang, Israel Michael Sigal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13376v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the evolution of Markovian open quantum systems. The dynamics are governed by the von Neumann-Lindblad equations. Our goal is to prove the return-to-equilibrium property for systems of infinite degrees of freedom under quantum detailed balance condition.

## 3. Complex abstract Wiener spaces

**Authors:** Tess J. van Leeuwen, Wioletta M. Ruszel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13346v1)

**Summary:**

Real abstract Wiener spaces (AWS) were originally defined by Gross using measurable norms. In this paper we present a rigorous, complete and self-contained general framework. We will prove that $X$ is a centred resp. proper $H$-valued Gaussian field over $K$ iff the covariance function can be written in terms of some non-negative, self-adjoint trace class operator. This allows for a commutative relation between the real and complex Gaussian fields.

## 4. Review of the Fractional Logistic Map and its Applications

**Authors:** Mark Edelman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13256v1)

**Summary:**

The regular logistic map was introduced in 1960s. It served as an example of a complex system, and was used as an instrument to demonstrate and investigate the period doubling cascade of bifurcations scenario of transition to chaos. In this paper, we review various fractional generalizations of the logistic Map and their applications. We also discuss how the map can be used to predict the future state of the universe. We conclude by looking at some of the potential applications of the map.

## 5. Lyapunov functions for Morse-Smale synchronisation diffeomorphisms

**Authors:** Jorge Buescu, Henrique M. Oliveira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13230v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13230v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the dynamical system governing the phase differences between three identical oscillators arranged symmetrically and coupled by burst interactions. By constructing a discrete Lyapunov function, we prove the existence of two asymptotically stable fixed points on the 2-torus T^2, which correspond to Huygens synchronisation of three clocks. The locked states have phase differences of (2 pi/3,4pi/3) and (4 pi/2,2 pi-3)

## 6. Breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov system and   trigonometric Yang-Baxter maps

**Authors:** Vincent Caudrelier, Nicholas J. Ossi, Barbara Prinari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13228v1)

**Summary:**

The interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, but no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-b breatheher interactions. The study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental Breather. The interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental Breathers with polarization shifts. These give the first examples of parametric Yang-Baxter maps of trigonometric type. It allows us to interpret the interactions in terms of a refactorization problem.

## 7. Scale-Dependent Suppression Functions and Functional Space Geometry in   Renormalization

**Authors:** Daniel Ketels

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the effects of a scale-dependent suppression function on the functional space geometry in renormalization theory. The suppression function smoothly regulates high-momentum contributions without requiring a hard cutoff. We show that it induces a modified metric on functional space, leading to a non-trivial Ricci curvature that becomes increasingly negative in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. Our findings provide a mathematical framework for studying regularization techniques and their role in the UV behavior of function spaces. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.

## 8. Gravito-turbulent bi-fluid protoplanetary discs: 1. An analytical   perspective to stratification

**Authors:** S. Rendon Restrepo, U. Ziegler, M. Villenave, O. Gressel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13136v1)

**Summary:**

In Class 0/I and the outskirts of Class II circumstellar discs, the self-gravity of gas significantly affects the disc's vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The contribution of dust, whose measured mass is still uncertain, could influence this equilibrium. Based on these findings, we propose a method to estimate disc mass through gas or dust settling observations. We introduce a generic definition of the dust-to-gas scale height, applicable to complex profiles. We also identified new exact solutions for benchmarking self- gravity solvers in numerical codes.

## 9. Resurgence in the Universal Structures in B-model Topological String   Theory

**Authors:** Yong Li, David Sauzin, Shanzhong Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12815v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a systematic analysis of Alim-Yau-Zhou's double scaling limit and Couso-Santamar\'{i}a's large radius limit for the perturbative free energies in B-model topological string theory. Taking advantage of the known resurgent properties of the formal solutions to the Airy equation, we show how to rigorously derive the non-perturbative information. We also discuss the Borel-Laplace summation of the obtained resurgent transseries.

## 10. Matrix phase-space representations in quantum optics

**Authors:** Peter D. Drummond, Alexander S. Dellios, Margaret D. Reid

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12749v1)

**Summary:**

The method is applied to verification of low-loss Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) quantum computational advantage experiments with up to 10,000 modes. We demonstrate improvements in sampling error by a factor of 1000 or more compared to unprojected methods, which are infeasible for such cases. We introduce matrix quantum phase-space distributions. These extend the idea of a quantumphase-space representation via projections onto a density matrix of global symmetry variables. The method was developed at the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 11. Pfaffian solution for dark-dark soliton to the coupled complex modified   Korteweg-de Vries equation

**Authors:** Chenxi Li, Xiaochuan Liu, Bao-Feng Feng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12740v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study coupled complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (ccmKdV) equation by combining Hirota's method and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) reduction method. First, we show that the bilinear form of the ccmKDV equation under nonzero boundary condition is linked to the discrete BKP hierarchy through Miwa transformation. Based on this finding, we construct the dark-dark soliton solution in the pfaffian form. The dynamical behaviors for one- and two-soliton are analyzed and illustrated.

**Authors:** Keshav Dahiya, Evgeny Mukhin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12716v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12716v1)

**Summary:**

We use the $q$-characters to give explicit expressions of the $R$-matrices for first fundamental representations of all types of twisted quantum affine algebras. We use the Q$-character to show that the $Q$- matrix is a matrix of the form QQQQ. We also use the R$- character to show the matrix as a matrix with the form RQRQQ QRQ QQR QQS QQT QQC QQF QQA QQD QQE QQG QQH QQJG QJF QJG.

## 13. Renormalization of Schrödinger equation for potentials with   inverse-square singularities: Generalized Trigonometric Pöschl-Teller model

**Authors:** U. Camara da Silva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a renormalization procedure necessary for the complete description of the energy spectra of a one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation with a potential that exhibits inverse-square singularities. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity. We apply and extend the methods introduced in our recent paper on the hyperbolic P\'osch Teller potential.
