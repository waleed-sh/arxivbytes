## 0. Quantum arrival times in free fall

**Authors:** Mathieu Beau, Timothey Szczepanski, Rafael Martellini, Lionel Martellini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21295v1)

**Summary:**

In an application to free-fall, this finding has been used to predict the existence of a mass-dependent positive relative shift with respect to the classical time-of-arrival. We first show that for a Gaussian quantum particle of mass $m$ dropped in a uniform gravitational field $g$, the uncertainties about time and position measurements are related by the relation $ \Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg} $ This novel form of uncertainty relation suggests that choosing the initial state so as to obtain a lower uncertainty in the measured position leads to a higher uncertainty in measured arrival time.

## 1. Exercises on the Kepler ellipses through a fixed point in space, after   Otto Laporte

**Authors:** Gert Heckman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21222v1)

**Summary:**

This article has a twofold purpose. On the one hand I would like to draw attention to some nice exercises on the Kepler laws, due to Otto Laporte from 1970. And on the other hand it serves as an addendum to a paper of mine from 1998 on the quantum integrability of the Kovalevsky top. Later I learned that this Integrability result had been obtained already long before by Laporti in 1933. So the discussion here has a more geometric flavour than the original analytic approach oflaporte.

## 2. An Eulerian formulation for dissipative materials using Lie derivatives   and GENERIC

**Authors:** Alexander Mielke

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21157v1)

**Summary:**

We recall the systematic formulation of Eulerian mechanics in terms of Lie derivatives along the vector field of the material points. We show that the transport via Lie derivatives generates in a natural way a Poisson structure on the chosen phase space. The evolution equations for thermo-viscoelastic-viscoplastic materials are formulated in the abstract framework of GENERIC (General Equations for Non-Equilibrium Reversible Irreversible Coupling) The equations may not be new, but the systematic splitting between reversible Hamiltonian and dissipative effects allows us to see them in a new light.

## 3. Hidden $sl(2)-$Symmetry of the Generalized Landau-Zener Vibronic Model

**Authors:** L. M. Nieto, S. Zarrinkamar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21145v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21145v1)

**Summary:**

The one-dimensional harmonic vibronic model, which is a generalization of the so-called linear Landau-Zener model, is revisited. After decoupling the components, the resulting fourth-order equation is shown to have a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. For completeness, the eigenfunctions are obtained via the Bethe ansatz approach directly in position space. The so- called exceptional part of the spectrum is then expressed in a rather simple way.

## 4. Incorporating Long-Range Interactions via the Multipole Expansion into   Ground and Excited-State Molecular Simulations

**Authors:** Rhyan Barrett, Johannes C. B. Dietschreit, Julia Westermayr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21045v1)

**Summary:**

FieldMACE is an extension of the message-passing atomic cluster expansion (MACE) architecture. It integrates the multipole expansion to model long-range interactions more efficiently. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate its superior performance in predictions and computational efficiency compared to previous architectures. Furthermore, transfer learning from foundational models enhances data efficiency, making FieldMACE a scalable, robust, and transferable framework for large-scale molecular simulations.

## 5. Spinning boson stars in nonlinear sigma models and Universal Relations

**Authors:** Christoph Adam, Jorge Castelo Mourelle, Alberto García Martín-Caro, Andrzej Wereszczynski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923v1)

**Summary:**

Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions.

## 6. Quantum group deformation of the Kittel--Shore model

**Authors:** A. Ballesteros, I. Gutiérrez-Sagredo, V. Mariscal, J. J. Relancio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20884v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20884v1)

**Summary:**

The Kittel--Shore (KS) Hamiltonian describes $N$ spins with long-range interactions that are identically coupled. In this paper, the underlying coalgebra symmetry of the KS model is demonstrated for arbitrary spins. The higher-spin $q$-KS models are sketched. The $q-KS model for spin-$1/2$ particles is analysed in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings. The cases with $N=2,3,$ and $4$ spins are studied in detail.

## 7. On the nonlinearity of Four-Dimensional Conformal Transformations in   spinor representation

**Authors:** Zhi-Peng Wang, X. X. Yi, Hai-Jun Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20776v1)

**Summary:**

Nonlinearity of the conformal group is an essential factor that ruins the global conformal invariance for interacting material fields. In this paper we attempt to track such nonlinearity from spacetime transformations to spinor representations. To this end we rederive the spinor representation by generalizing the linear fractional transformation from two dimensions to four dimensions via replacing complex numbers with biquaternions. These two transformations do not lead to nonlinear terms in Yukawa term, but do in vector-spinor interaction. And the non linear terms would definitely cause $CP$ violation.

## 8. Solving the Riccati Equation

**Authors:** Everardo Rivera-Oliva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20688v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, the Riccati equation is resolved using the generalized recursive integrating factor method. By applying a non-linear transformation, a second-order linear differential equation is derived for a variable $u(x)$ that is related to $y( x)$ through the aforementioned transformation. The general solution for $u (x) is then transformed back to obtain the general solution. The study concludes by solving a few illustrative application examples of the RicCati equation.
