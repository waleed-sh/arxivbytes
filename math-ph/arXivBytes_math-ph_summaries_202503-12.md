## 0. Isotropic embeddings of coadjoint orbits and magnetic geodesic flows

**Authors:** Dmitri Bykov, Andrew Kuzovchikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08646v1)

**Summary:**

We consider isotropic and Lagrangian embeddings of coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups. We prove equivalence between systems of two types: those describing magnetic geodesic flow on flag manifolds and classical `spin chains' of a special type. In the second part we apply this to the study of dynamical systems with $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ symmetry, proving equivalence in the case of the special type of spin chains. We conclude that the equivalence is true in both cases.

## 1. Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra

**Authors:** Vassily Gorbounov, Christian Korff, Leonardo C. Mihalcea

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602v1)

**Summary:**

In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians. We construct geometrically defined operators onQuantumK-rings describing this action. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the Quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action) In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.

## 2. Limiting distributions of ergodic continuous-time quantum walks on   periodic graphs

**Authors:** Anne Boutet de Monvel, Kiran Kumar A. S., Mostafa Sabri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08595v1)

**Summary:**

In some families, the walk is ergodic in both horizontal and sectional directions, while in others, ergodicity only holds in the horizontal (large N) direction. We compare this to the limiting distribution of classical random walks on the same graphs. In this expository note, we study several families of periodic graphs which satisfy a sufficient condition for the er godicity of the associated continuous-time quantum walk. For these graphs, we compute the limitingribution of the walk explicitly.

## 3. Fundamental solutions of heat equation on unitary groups establish an   improved relation between $ε$-nets and approximate unitary $t$-designs

**Authors:** Oskar Słowik, Oliver Reardon-Smith, Adam Sawicki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08577v1)

**Summary:**

The concepts of $t$ and $epsilon$ are important and ubiquitous across quantum computation and information. In recent work, quantitative relations have revealed the close connection between the two constructions. In this work, we improve these results, significantly increasing the bound on the $delta$ required for a $t'-net. We also outline the possible applications of our results in quantum circuit overheads, quantum complexity and black hole physics. We achieve this by constructing polynomial approximations to the Dirac delta using heat kernels on the projective unitary group.

## 4. Effects of inertia on the asynchronous state of a disordered Kuramoto   model

**Authors:** Yagmur Kati, Ralf Toenjes, Benjamin Lindner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08572v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08572v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the role of inertia in the asynchronous state of a disordered Kuramoto model. We also find an unexpected effect when varying the degree of inertia. The correlation time of the oscillators becomes minimal at an intermediate mass. correspondingly, the power spectra appear flatter and thus more similar to white noise around the same value of mass. We find a similar effect for the Lyapunov spectra of the single oscillators when the mass is varied. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics.

## 5. On the analog of the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition representation for   continuous functions of several $p$-adic variables

**Authors:** Alexander P. Zubarev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08547v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08547v1)

**Summary:**

It is shown that any continuous function depending on several $p$-adic variables can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one $p-adic variable. This statement is true for both functions with values in $R$ and $Q$ and for functions withvalues in $Q' and $R' respectively. It is also true for all continuous functions depending on $p' that are defined on $Z' and "Z" or "Z+1" or "Z-1"

## 6. Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds

**Authors:** Xing Wang, An Zhang, Cheng Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504v1)

**Summary:**

We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. As applications, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity. We observe a new phenomenon that the results in the supercritical regime are sensitive to the geometry of the manifold.

## 7. On the continuity of phase transition of three-dimensional   square-lattice XY models

**Authors:** Zhou Gang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08488v1)

**Summary:**

We study the continuity of magnetization at the phase transition of the ferromagnetic XY model in the three-dimensional square lattice with the nearest neighborhood interaction. We assume that, at the critical temperature, with probability 1, for every edge in the infinite directed graph generated by the random path representation, finitely many edges exist so that they form a finite loop. The main technical contribution is to find a switching lemma to establish a bijection between equally weighted graphs. We prove that thephase transition is continuous at thecritical temperature.

## 8. Cluster expansions of particle system state with topological   nearest-neighbor interaction

**Authors:** V. I. Gerasimenko, I. V. Gapyak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08412v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08412v1)

**Summary:**

The article presents the concept of a cumulant representation for distribution functions describing the states of many-particle systems with topological nearest-neighbor interaction. A solution to the Cauchy problem for the hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations for the cumulants of distribution functions of such systems is constructed. The connection between the constructed solution and the series expansion structure for a solution of the BBGKY hierarchy has been established. Furthermore, the expansion structure is used to find a solution to a problem for reduced observables of topologically interacting particles.

## 9. The oriented swap process on half line

**Authors:** Yuan Tian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08341v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study the oriented swap process on the positive integers and its asymptotic properties. Our results extend a theorem by Angel, Holroyd, and Romik regarding the trajectories of particles in the finiteoriented swap process. We study the evolution of the type of a particle at the leftmost position over time. Our approach relies on a relationship between multi-species particle systems and Hecke algebras, complemented by a detailed asymPTotic analysis.

## 10. Scrambling for precision: optimizing multiparameter qubit estimation in   the face of sloppiness and incompatibility

**Authors:** Jiayu He, Matteo G. A. Paris

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08235v1)

**Summary:**

Multiparameter quantum estimation theory plays a crucial role in advancing quantum metrology. We explore the connection between sloppiness and incompatibility by introducing an adjustable scrambling operation for parameter encoding. We also compare the performance of joint parameter estimation to strategies involving successive separate estimation steps. Our results provide a unified perspective on the trade-offs inherent to multiparameter qubit statistical models, offering practical insights for optimizing experimental designs. We conclude that the ultimate precision can be achieved whensloppiness is minimized.

## 11. A simple model of quantum walk with a gap in distribution

**Authors:** Takuya Machida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08151v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum walks are quantum counterparts of random walks and their probability distributions are different from each other. Although the walker launches off a location under a localized initial state, some numerical experiments show that the quantum walker does not seem to distribute around the launching location. This suggests that the probability distribution holds a gap around the launch location. To prove the gap analytically, we derive a long-time limit distribution, from which one can tell more details about the finding probability. We study a 1-dimensional quantum walk in this paper.

## 12. Non-hermitian integrable systems from constant non-invertible solutions   of the Yang-Baxter equation

**Authors:** Somnath Maity, Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08109v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08109v1)

**Summary:**

We construct invertible spectral parameter dependent Yang-Baxter solutions. The solutions are algebraic (representation independent) They are constructed using supersymmetry (SUSY) algebras. The resulting $R$-matrices are regular leading to local non-hermitian Hamiltonians. With appropriate representations of the SUSY generators we obtain spin chains in all local Hilbert space dimensions. On comparing with the literature we find two of the models are new. Many of them are also non-diagonalizable with interesting spectrums.

## 13. Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

**Authors:** Xin Li, Chengli Zhao, Xue Zhang, Xiaojun Duan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08059v1)

**Summary:**

Differential equations are widely used to describe complex dynamical systems with evolving parameters in nature and engineering. Effectively learning a family of maps from the parameter function to the system dynamics is of great significance. We propose a novel learning framework of symbolic continuous-depth neural networks, termed Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (SNODEs) We apply the SNODEs framework to partial differential equation systems through Fourier analysis, achieving resolution-invariant modeling. It can be further applied to a wide range of scientific problems, such as system bifurcation and control.

## 14. Asymptotic Scattering Relation for the Toda Lattice

**Authors:** Amol Aggarwal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08018v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we consider the Toda lattice at thermal equilibrium. We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of solitons (or "soliton gas'') We show that local charges and currents are well-approximated by simple functions of the soliton data. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigen vector entries of the Todas' (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering.

## 15. On Minimizing Phase Space Energies

**Authors:** Michael Updike, Nicholas Bohlsen, Hong Qin, Nathaniel Fisch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07965v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07965v1)

**Summary:**

A primary technical challenge for harnessing fusion energy is to control and extract energy from a non-thermal distribution of charged particles. The fact that phase space evolves by symplectomorphisms fundamentally limits how a distribution may be manipulated. The method introduced in the present study enables an energy-based proof of the linear Gromov non-squeezing theorem. We show that the extractable energy under linear symplectmorphisms may be much smaller than the extract able energy under special linear maps.
