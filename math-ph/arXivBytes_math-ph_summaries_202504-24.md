## 0. Boundary Witten effect in multi-axion insulators

**Authors:** Giandomenico Palumbo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16919v1)

**Summary:**

We explore novel topological responses and axion-like phenomena in three-dimensional insulating systems with spacetime-dependent mass terms encoding domain walls. Via a dimensional-reduction approach, we derive a newAxion-electromagnetic coupling term involving three axion fields. This term yields a topological current in the bulk and real-space topological defects such as magnetic-like monopoles and hopfions. Our findings reveal rich topological structures emerging from multi-axion theories, suggesting new avenues in the study of topological phases and defects.

## 1. Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance

**Authors:** Malte Henkel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857v1)

**Summary:**

A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing. This arises in many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $ t_c$. Generalised time- translation-invaryance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries.

## 2. Simple and accurate nonlinear pendulum motion for the full range of   amplitudes

**Authors:** Teepanis Chachiyo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816v1)

**Summary:**

A simple closed-form formula for the period of a pendulum with finite amplitude is proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the small and large amplitude limits. In the mid-amplitude range it maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications. Its unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss a finite amplitude pendulum.

## 3. Spinning top in quadratic potential and matrix dressing chain

**Authors:** V. E. Adler, A. P. Veselov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16701v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the equations of motion of the rigid body about a fixed point in the Newtonian field with a quadratic potential are special reduction of period-one closure of the Darboux dressing chain for the Schr\"odinger operators with matrix potentials. Some new explicit solutions of the corresponding matrix system and the spectral properties of the related Schr\'odinger operators are discussed. We also discuss the spectral properties of the related Schr\'od  operators.

## 4. Non-uniqueness of (Stochastic) Lagrangian Trajectories for Euler   Equations

**Authors:** Huaxiang Lü, Michael Röckner, Xiangchan Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687v1)

**Summary:**

We are concerned with the (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories associated with Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. The proof is based on the non-uniqueness of positive solutions to the corresponding transport equations, in conjunction with the superposition principle. Our result is sharp in 2D in the sense that: (1) in the stochastic case, for any vector field $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p>2$, the associated stochastically Lagrangians trajectory associated with $v$ is unique.

## 5. A two-dimensional swarmalator model with higher-order interactions

**Authors:** Md Sayeed Anwar, Gourab Kumar Sar, Timoteo Carletti, Dibakar Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16599v1)

**Summary:**

A swarmalator model incorporates higher-order phase interactions, uncovering a diverse range of collective states. The latter include spatially coherent and gas-like configurations, neither of which appear in models with only pairwise interactions. We discover bistability between various states, a phenomenon that arises directly from the inclusion of higher- order interactions. By analyzing several of these emergent states analytically, both for identical and nonidentical populations of swarmalators, we gain deeper insights into their underlying mechanisms and stability conditions.

## 6. Mass-Critical Neutron Stars in the Hartree-Fock and   Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Theories

**Authors:** Bin Chen, Yujin Guo, Phan Thành Nam, Dong Hao Ou Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16462v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the ground states of neutron stars and white dwarfs. We prove that if the total mass is at the critical mass, then the HFB minimizers do not exist for any gravitational constant. The HF minimizers exist for every gravitational constant except for a countable set, which is fully characterized by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for orthonormal systems. Our results complement the existence results in the sub-critical mass case established in [E. Lenzmann and M. Lewin, Duke Math. J., 2010].

## 7. Qubit Geometry through Holomorphic Quantization

**Authors:** Ahmad Hazazi Ahmad Sumadi, Nurisya Mohd Shah, Umair Abdul Halim, Hishamuddin Zainuddin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16426v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a wave mechanics formalism for qubit geometry using holomorphic functions and Mobius transformations. This framework offers a natural interpretation of standard quantum gates on the Riemann sphere that is examined through their Mobius action on holomorphic wavefunction. These wavefunctions emerge via a quantization process. The result provides a new direction for exploring quantum computation through Isham's canonical group quantization and its holomorphic polarization method. It also reveals how geometric transformations induce quantum logic gates in the classical phase space.

## 8. Spectral stability of periodic traveling waves in   Caudrey-Dodd-Gibbon-Sawada-Kotera Equation

**Authors:** Sudhir Singh, Ashish Kumar Pandey, Nitesh Sharma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16425v1)

**Summary:**

We study the spectral stability of the one-dimensional small-amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Caudrey-Dodd-Gibbon-Sawada-Kotera equation. We show that these waves are spectrally stable with respect to co-periodic as well as square integrable perturbations. We also show that they are stable in terms of co- Periodic and square Integrable Perturbations of the equation. The results are published in the Journal of Applied Physics.

## 9. Complex tridiagonal quantum Hamiltonians and matrix continued fractions

**Authors:** Miloslav Znojil

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16424v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum resonances described by non-Hermitian tridiagonal-matrix Hamiltonians $H$ with complex energy eigenvalues $E_n $ are considered. The numerical convergence of the recipe is found quick, supported also by a fixed-point-based formal proof. In an illustrative application of the formalism, a discrete version of conventional Hamiltonian $H=-d^2/dx^2+V(x)$ withcomplex local $V( x) \neq V^*(x), is considered.

## 10. On the four-body limaçon choreography: maximal superintegrability   and choreographic fragmentation

**Authors:** Adrian M Escobar-Ruiz, Manuel Fernandez-Guasti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16403v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate the maximal superintegrability of the reduced Hamiltonian, which governs the four-body choreographic planar motion along the lima\c{c}on trisectrix. The emergence of this choreography is not a direct consequence of maximal superIntegrability. Rather, it originates from the existence of particular integrals and the phenomenon oficular involution. The fragmentation of a more general four- body choreographic motion into two isomorphic two-body choreographies is discussed in detail.

## 11. On Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1$-orbifolds and topological   difference equations

**Authors:** Zhengfei Huang, Di Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16375v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we introduce a matrix linear difference equation, prove existence and uniqueness of its formal Puiseux-series solutions, and use them to give conjectural formulas for $k$-point ($k\ge2) functions. Explicit expressions of the unique solutions are also obtained. We carry out concrete computations of the first few invariants by using the conjecture formulas. For the case when one of $m_1,m_2$ equals 1, we prove validity of the conjectural formula with $k \ge3$.
