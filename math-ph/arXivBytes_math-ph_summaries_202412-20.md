## 0. Quantum diffusion and delocalization in one-dimensional band matrices   via the flow method

**Authors:** Sofiia Dubova, Kevin Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15207v1)

**Summary:**

We study a class of Gaussian random band matrices of dimension $N \times N$ and band-width $W$. We show that delocalization holds for bulk eigenvectors and that quantum diffusion holds for the resolvent. Our analysis is based on a flow method, and a refinement of it may lead to an improvement on the condition $W \gg N^{8/11}$, we say. We conclude that the method is a good way to study band matrixes.

## 1. On the perturbed Friedmann equations in Newtonian Gauge

**Authors:** Jaume de Haro, Emilio Elizalde, Supriya Pan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15139v1)

**Summary:**

We present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.

## 2. Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories

**Authors:** Baptiste Filoche, Stefan Hohenegger, Taro Kimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048v1)

**Summary:**

$A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle. A surface defect breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. We discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit.

## 3. Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper   model

**Authors:** Alice C. Quillen, Abobakar Sediq Miakhel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14926v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. The distribution of quasi-energies in the ergodic subspace resembles that of a random matrix model. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix.

## 4. Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems

**Authors:** Haoyan Chen, Yi Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for thenon-Hermitsian edge spectra. In addition, we use the method to study non- hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations.

## 5. Expansion into the vacuum of stochastic gases with long-range   interactions

**Authors:** P. L. Krapivsky, Kirone Mallick

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14875v1)

**Summary:**

We study the evolution of a system of many point particles initially concentrated in a small region in $d$ dimensions. Particles undergo overdamped motion caused by pairwise interactions through the long-ranged repulsive $r^{-s}$ potential. Each particle is also subject to Brownian noise. The density is spatially uniform and inversely proportional to time independent of the spatial dimension. We deduce self-similar solutions for all $s\in (-2,1)$. The expansion of Coulomb gases remains well-defined in the infinite-particle limit.

## 6. Solutions of stationary McKean-Vlasov equation on a high-dimensional   sphere and other Riemannian manifolds

**Authors:** Anna Shalova, Andr√© Schlichting

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14813v1)

**Summary:**

We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equation on a high-dimensional sphere and other compact Riemannian manifolds. We extend the equivalence of the energetic problem formulation to the manifold setting and characterize critical points of the corresponding free energy functional. We also give a sufficient condition for an existence of a discontinuous transition point in terms of the interaction kernel. We illustrate our results on a range of system, including the particle system arising from the transformer models and the Onsager model of liquid crystals.

## 7. Cyclic Representations of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ and its Borel   Subalgebras at Roots of Unity and Q-operators

**Authors:** Robert Weston

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14811v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14811v1)

**Summary:**

We show how the tensor product of two representations of the upper Borel subalgebra of $U_q$ is related to the Q- operator. We construct short exact sequences of the different representations and use the results to construct Q operators that satisfy TQ relations for $q^N=1$ for both the 6-vertex and $tau_2$ models. The result is analogous to the factorization property of the Verma module of $ U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at generic-$q.

## 8. Solving Unbalanced Optimal Transport on Point Cloud by Tangent Radial   Basis Function Method

**Authors:** Jiangong Pan, Wei Wan, Chenlong Bao, Zuoqiang Shi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14746v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we solve unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) problem on surfaces represented by point clouds. Based on alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, the original UOT problem can be solved by an iteration consists of three steps. The key ingredient is to solve a Poisson equation on point cloud which is solved by tangent radial basis function (TRBF) method. Numerical experiments conducted on point clouds with varying geometry and topology demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

## 9. Heat Conduction with {\it aging} memory

**Authors:** Sandra Carillo, Claudio Giorgi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14725v1)

**Summary:**

The term material with memory is generally used to indicate materials whose mechanical and/or thermodynamical behaviour depends not only on the process at the present time but also on the history of the process itself. Crucial in heat conductors withmemory is the heat relaxation function which models the thermal response of the material. The present study is concerned about a thermodynamic problem with memory "aging"; that is, we analyze the temperature evolution within a rigid heat conductor with memory whose relaxation function takes into account the aging of thematerial.

## 10. On the geometry of Lagrangian one-forms

**Authors:** Vincent Caudrelier, Derek Harland

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14700v1)

**Summary:**

Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation. We also show that our new framework easily extends to non-commuting flows corresponding to nonabelian Lie groups. Thus Hamiltonian Lie group actions can be derived from a Variational principle.

## 11. Clifford geometric algebra: Real and complex spinor data tables

**Authors:** A. Acus, A. Dargys

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14677v1)

**Summary:**

The modern algebra concepts are used to construct tables of algebraic spinors related to Clifford algebra multivectors with real and complex coefficients. The following data computed by Mathematica are presented in form of tables for individual Clifford geometric algebras. Earlier in 1998, only the first four items computed by Maple were published by R. Ablamowicz. The first item, the hermitian norm of the spinor, was published in 1998. The second and third items were published in 1999.

## 12. Verlinde rings and cluster algebras arising from quantum affine algebras

**Authors:** Chul-hee Lee, Jian-Rong Li, Euiyong Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14601v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14601v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate a positivity conjecture relating the Verlinde ring associated with an untwisted affine Lie algebra at a positive integer level. We prove this conjecture in certain cases where the underlying simple Lie algebra is simply-laced with level 2 or of type $A_1$ at an arbitrary level. The proof employs the close connection between this category and cluster algebras of finite cluster type. As further evidence for the conjecture, we show that for any level, all objects have positive quantum dimensions under the assumption that some Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules havepositive quantum dimensions.

## 13. Lie Symmetries for the Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamics Equations in a   Rotating Reference Frame

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis, Amlan Halder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14578v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a relaxing condition for the one-dimensional problem, which has been used to overcome unphysical behaviors. The admitted Lie symmetries for the hyperbolic system form different Lie algebras. For the general case we derive all the invariants for the Adjoint action of the Lie algebra $L^{6}$ and its subalgebraes. These elements are then considered to define similarity transformations and construct analytic solutions for theHyperbolic System. We calculate all the elements of the one dimensional optimal system.

## 14. Anomalous Continuous Translations

**Authors:** Nathan Seiberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14434v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories. The Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry is broken to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.
