## 0. Effects of Spatial Curvature on Blackbody Radiation: Modifications to   Energy Distribution and Fundamental Laws

**Authors:** Somayeh Kourkinejat, Ali Mahdifar, Ehsan Amooghorban

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03208v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the effects of spatial curvature on blackbody radiation. By employing an analog model of general relativity, we replace the conventional straight-line harmonic oscillators with oscillators on a circle. We find that moving from flat to curved space results in a reduction in both the height and width of the Planck function. Increasing the curvature leads to a pronounced redshift in the peak frequency. We also analyze the influence of spatial curvature on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Rayleigh-Jeans law, and Wien law.

## 1. Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory

**Authors:** Francis Brown, Clément Dupont

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202v1)

**Summary:**

''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'' We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory. We prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes. We identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometry and their canonical forms.

## 2. Bell and Mermin inequalities in Quantum Field Theory from vacuum   projectors and Weyl operators

**Authors:** M. S. Guimaraes, I. Roditi, S. P. Sorella, A. F. Vieira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03186v1)

**Summary:**

The use of the vacuum projector $|0 \rangle \langle 0| enables us to construct a set of Hermitian dichotomic operators in relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski spacetime. Employing test functions supported in diamond regions, both Bell and Mermin inequalities are studied by means of a numerical setup. In addition to reporting expressive violations of both inequalities, the cluster property is also checked. The results are published in the book "Quantum Field Theory: Theory and Practice"

## 3. A New Proof of the Sharp Gordon's Lemma: No Eigenvalues for   Schrödinger Operators with Almost Repetition Potentials

**Authors:** Wencai Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03157v1)

**Summary:**

We provide a new proof of the sharp Gordon's lemma, which asserts the absence of eigenvalues for Schr\"odinger operators with almost repetition potentials. We build on the work of Jitomirskaya-Simon and Jitomskaya-Liu, who established that eigen values are not present for such operators. We show that the absence is due to the sharpGordon's lemmas. We also show that there are no eigen Values for Schr \"odinger operators with almost reflective repetition potential.

## 4. Velocity Addition/Subtraction in Special Relativity

**Authors:** Domenico Giulini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03149v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we re-derive velocity addition/subtraction in Special Relativity. We offer a less familiar alternative geometric view that leads to an invariant definition of the concept of relative velocity between two states of motion. We also offer an elementary proof that does not seem to be widely known in the relativity literature. Finally we compare this to the corresponding geometric definitions in Galilei-Newton spacetime, emphasising similarities and differences. The paper is published by Springer in the form of a book.

## 5. Resurgence of the Tilted Cusp Anomalous Dimension

**Authors:** Gerald V. Dunne

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03105v1)

**Summary:**

We use resurgent extrapolation and continuation methods to extract detailed analytic information about the tilted cusp anomalous dimension. This enables accurate and smooth interpolation between the weak and strong coupling limits, and identifies the relevant singularities governing the finite radius of convergence of the weak coupling expansion. The input data is purely perturbative, generated from the BES equations, and these resurgent methods extract accurate non-perturbative information which matches the underlying physical structure. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics.

## 6. Growth-fragmentations, Brownian cone excursions and SLE(6) explorations   of a quantum disc

**Authors:** William Da Silva, Ellen Powell, Alexander Watson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03010v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03010v1)

**Summary:**

A growth-fragmentation process naturally embedded in a Brownian excursion from boundary to apex in a cone of angle $2\pi/3. This process corresponds, via the so-called mating-of-trees encoding arXiv:1409.7055, to the quantum boundary length process associated with a branching quantum disc. However, our proof uses only Brownian motion techniques, and along the way we discover various properties of Brownian cone excursions and their connections with stable L\'evy processes.

## 7. On the Polynomial Degeneracy of Ricci Invariants and Spacetime   Singularity

**Authors:** Soumya Chakrabarti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02903v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the connection of a general relativistic matter-energy momentum tensor with the polynomial degeneracies of higher order curvature invariants defined in Riemannian geometry. The degeneracies enforce additional constraints on the energy-momentum tensor components. Due to these constraints the formation of a curvature singularity can no longer be treated as inevitable. We find that there can be a formation of singularity iff the interior fluid evolves into (i) a pressure-less dust, (ii) an isotropic sphere or (iii) a distribution with negative pressure.

## 8. Multi-indexed Orthogonal Polynomials of a Discrete Variable and Exactly   Solvable Birth and Death Processes

**Authors:** Satoru Odake

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02877v1)

**Summary:**

We present the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable for 8 types. Based on them, exactly solvable continuous time birth and death processes are obtained. Their discrete time versions (Markov chains) are also obtained for finite types. The results are published in the open-access book, "Theory of Polynomial Analysis," published by Oxford University Press on November 14, 2013.

## 9. Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned

**Authors:** Koji Yamaguchi, Achim Kempf

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02757v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02757v1)

**Summary:**

 encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. A possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage. Beyond applications in cryptography, encrypted cloning could provide a form of redundancy, parallelism, fault tolerance or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden.

## 10. A maximum principle for the Coulomb gas: microscopic density bounds,   confinement estimates, and high temperature limits

**Authors:** Eric Thoma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02733v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02733v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce and prove a maximum principle for a natural quantity related to the $k$-point correlation function of the classical one- component Coulomb gas. As an application, we show that the gas is confined to the droplet by a well-known effective potential in dimensions two and higher. We also prove new upper bounds for the particle density in the droplets that apply at any temperature. In particular, we give the first controls on the microscopic point process for high temperature Coulomb gases beyond the mean-field regime.

## 11. Dynamical localization and eigenvalue asymptotics: power-law unbounded   discrete operators

**Authors:** M. Aloisio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02692v1)

**Summary:**

We establish a notion of Strong Power-Law SULE. We obtain a result on dynamical localization for long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field. We also prove, on a hypothesis of semi-uniform polynomial decay of eigenfunctions, that the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators of the form $H = A + V$ is governed by the same power-law $n^\alpha$.
