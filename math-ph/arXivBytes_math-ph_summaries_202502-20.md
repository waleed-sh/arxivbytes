## 0. Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties

**Authors:** Hunter Dinkins, Jiwu Jang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quasimap vertices of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertices can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions. This proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertices. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $ D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets.

## 1. Isometries of spacetimes without observer horizons

**Authors:** Leonardo García-Heveling, Abdelghani Zeghib

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13904v1)

**Summary:**

We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometric group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $Z or $R.

## 2. The anisotropic Cahn--Hilliard equation with degenerate mobility:   Existence of weak solutions

**Authors:** Harald Garcke, Patrik Knopf, Andrea Signori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13799v1)

**Summary:**

Degenerate Cahn--Hilliard equation is an important model to model solid-state dewetting (SSD) of thin films. The introduction of anisotropy leads to highly nonlinear terms making energy and entropy estimates rather involved. The model allows for the degeneracy of the mobility at specific concentration values, demonstrating that the solution remains within physically relevant bounds. We show existence of weak solutions for the anisotropic degenerate Cahn-- Hilliard equation by using suitableenergy and entropy type estimates.

## 3. Induced Quantum Divergence: A New Lens on Communication and Source   Coding

**Authors:** Gilad Gour

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13669v1)

**Summary:**

The induced divergence is a new quantum divergence measure that replaces the hypothesis testing divergence in position-based decoding. Derived from a parent quantum relative entropy, it retains key properties such as data processing inequality and L\"owner monotonicity. Two key applications are considered: classical communication over quantum channels, where the induced divergence improves lower bounds on the distillable communication rate, and quantum state redistribution, where it leads to sharper bounds on communication costs. These results provide new insights into fundamental single-shot quantum information protocols and enhance existing analytical techniques.

## 4. On dimensions of (2+1)D abelian bosonic topological systems on   unoriented manifolds

**Authors:** Ippo Orii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13532v1)

**Summary:**

We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to unoriented surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we could assign Hilbert space with integer dimensions to un oriented surfaces in the case of abelians with time-reversal symmetry. We also show that this can be done in a number of other ways.

## 5. Stäckel transform, coupling constant metamorphosis and algebraization   of quasi-exactly solvable systems

**Authors:** Siyu Li, Ian Marquette, Yao-Zhong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13365v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the notions of the St\"ackel transform and the coupling constant metamorphosis to quasi-exactly solvable systems. This discovery has interesting applications, such as Hooke's atoms in magnetic fields and Newtonian cosmology. The approach of coupling constant meetingamorphosis was successfully applied previously in the context of exactly solvable, integrable and superintegrable systems. To our knowledge, the present work is the first to apply the idea and approach in the contexts of quasi-Exactly Solvable systems, we say.
