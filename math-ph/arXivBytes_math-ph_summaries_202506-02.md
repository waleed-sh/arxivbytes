## 0. Emergent boundary supersymmetry in a one dimensional superconductor

**Authors:** Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria, Colin Rylands, Natan Andrei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24777v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24777v1)

**Summary:**

The interplay between bulk properties and boundary conditions in one-dimensional quantum systems gives rise to many intriguing phenomena. These include the emergence of zero energy modes which are of significant interest to a variety of fields. In this work we investigate the presence of such zero modes in cases where the boundary conditions are dynamical and arise due to the coupling to some quantum degrees of freedom. In particular, we study a one- dimensional spin-singlet superconductor, modeled by the Gross-Neveu field theory.

## 1. The critical temperature $T_{cr}$(Ising) is constructive

**Authors:** Senya Shlosman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24750v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the Dobrushin-Shlosman conditions $C_{V}$ for the uniqueness of the Gibbs state provide an exact estimate for the critical temperature of the $d$-dimensional Ising model. Our method also shows that the $ d$- dimensional Isingmodel with a magnetic field is Completely Analytic above its critical temperature. We conclude that this method is the most effective way to study the behavior of a $d#-dimensional ising model with magnetic field.

## 2. The quantitative semi-classical limit of a large Fermi system at zero   temperature

**Authors:** Esteban Cárdenas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24706v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24706v1)

**Summary:**

In this article we consider a large system of fermions in a combined mean-field and semiclassical limit, in three dimensions. We investigate the convergence of the Wigner function of the ground state, towards the classical Thomas-Fermi theory. One of the main ingredients is a recent result on the validity of semi-classical commutator estimates satisfied by the Hartree theory. The main novelty of the present article is quantifying the convergence rate with respect to the semi- classical parameter.

## 3. Elliptic Calogero-Sutherland model and conformal field theory

**Authors:** Edwin Langmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24700v1)

**Summary:**

In a project with Gordon Semenoff on 1+1 dimensional QCD many years ago, we stumbled over a method to solve Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models using gauge theories. Since then, these models have reappeared in different forms in many of my research projects. In this contribution, I describe a recent such project where a second quantization of the elliptic CalogERO-S Sutherland model led us to a new soliton equation and a non-relativistic variant of the Coleman correspondence.

## 4. Square Entropy and Uniform n-to-1 Bernoulli Transformations

**Authors:** Pouya Mehdipour, Somayeh Jangjooye Shaldehi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24647v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we define the so-called square entropy and prove that n-to-1 full zip shift maps are intrinsically ergodic. Furthermore, we show that square entropy characterizes uniform n- to-1 transformations of $(m,l)$-Bernoulli type that are extended Bernoulli transformations. We conclude that the square entropy of a full zip-shift map is n to the right from n to 1 to 1.

## 5. Generalized chord diagrams and weight systems

**Authors:** M. Kazarian, E. Krasilnikov, S. Lando, M. Shapiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24491v1)

**Summary:**

Weight systems are functions on chord diagrams satisfying Vassiliev's $4$-term relations. They originate in the theory of finite type knot invariants. We show that the $gl$- and $so$- weight systems satisfy these relations. We also analyze certain properties of these weight systems and study realted Hopf algebras of permutations. We suggest relations for functions on permutations, which generalize Vassilliev's relations. For more information, visit: http://www.sciencemag.org/.

## 6. A universal constraint for relaxation rates for quantum Markov   generators: complete positivity and beyond

**Authors:** Dariusz Chruściński, Frederik vom Ende, Gen Kimura, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24467v1)

**Summary:**

 Relaxation rates are key characteristics of quantum processes. They determine how quickly a quantum system thermalizes, equilibrates, decoheres, and dissipates. Recently, it was shown that for quantum processes governed by Markovian semigroups, the relaxation rates satisfy a universal constraint. This bound, initially conjectured a few years ago, was only recently proven using classical Lyapunov theory. The researchers show that complete positivity can be relaxed to 2-positivity without affecting the validity of the constraint.

## 7. An inverse problem for the Standard Model of particle physics

**Authors:** Xi Chen, Matti Lassas, Lauri Oksanen, Gabriel P. Paternain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24454v1)

**Summary:**

We pose and solve an inverse problem for the classical field equations that arise in the Standard Model of particle physics. Our main result describes natural conditions on the representations, so that it is possible to recover all the fields from measurements in a small set within a causal domain in Minkowski space. These conditions are satisfied for the representations arising in theStandard Model. We present our results in a paper published in the Journal of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 8. A system of 2 nonlinearly coupled ODEs which is explicitly solvable and   possibly isochronous provided its coefficients are suitably restricted

**Authors:** Fabio Briscese, Francesco Calogero, Farrin Payandeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24370v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24370v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we discuss some remarkable properties of the autonomous system of 2 first-order Ordinary Differential Equations. We show that if these 23 coefficients are given by 23 (explicitly provided) formulas in terms of 15 a priori arbitrary parameters, then the initial values problem (with arbitrary initial data $x_n (0)$) for this dynamical system can be explicitly solved. We also show that it is possible (with the help of Mathematica) to identify 12 explicit constraints on these 23 coefficient. Several such explicitly solvable systems of ODEs are treated.

## 9. Characterizing the limiting critical Potts measures on locally   regular-tree-like expander graphs

**Authors:** Hang Du, Yanxin Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24283v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24283v1)

**Summary:**

For any integers $d,q\ge 3$, we consider the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model with an external field on a sequence of expander graphs that converges to the $d$-regular tree. We show that along the critical line, any subsequential local weak limit of the Potts measures is a mixture of the free and wired Potts Gibbs measures on $\mathtt{T}_d$. We show the possibility of an arbitrary extent of strong phase coexistence.
