## 0. Towards construction of superintegrable basis in matrix models

**Authors:** Azheev Batukhan, Nikita Tselousov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07583v1)

**Summary:**

We develop methods for systematic construction of superintegrable polynomials in matrix/eigenvalue models. We detail our method in case of the Gaussian Hermitian model, and then apply it to the cubic Kontsevich model. The main two assumptions are box adding/removing rule (Pierri rule) and existence of Hamiltonian for superIntegrable Polynomial. We propose a set of assumptions that may allow one to recover superintegRable polynnomials.

## 1. Concentration via Metastable Mixing, with Applications to the   Supercritical Exponential Random Graph Model

**Authors:** Vilas Winstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571v1)

**Summary:**

It is a folklore belief that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-tem temperature behavior. We prove a rigorous version of this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. We obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the count of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges. We also discuss the results of what appears to be the first simulation study of a metastachable well in the supercritical ERGM.

## 2. Construction of blowup solutions for Liouville systems

**Authors:** Zetao Cheng, Haoyu Li, Lei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07467v1)

**Summary:**

We study the following Liouville system defined on a flat torus. The matrix $A=(a_1,..,u_n)$ satisfies certain properties. One central problem is whether multi-bubble solutions do exist. In this work we present a comprehensive construction of multi- bubble solutions in the most general setting. We show that the system is doubly periodic on $partial\Omega$ and $h_j>0$ on $C^3(\Omega)$.

## 3. A new density limit for unanimity in majority dynamics on random graphs

**Authors:** Jeong Han Kim, BaoLinh Tran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07447v1)

**Summary:**

 Majority dynamics is a process on a simple, undirected graph $G$ with an initial Red/Blue color for every vertex of $G$. Each day, each vertices updates its color following the majority among its neighbors, using its previous color for tie-breaking. The dynamics achieves \textit{unanimity} if every vertices has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \text it{win}. L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\Delta$ such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1.

## 4. BV description of $N = 1$, $D = 4$ Supegravity in the first order   formalism

**Authors:** Alberto S. Cattaneo, Filippo Fila-Robattino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07373v1)

**Summary:**

This note examines the BV formulation of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in the first-order Palatini--Cartan framework. Challenges in achieving an off-shell formulation are addressed by introducing corrections to the rank 2 BV action. It offers in addition a solid foundation for the study of the theory on manifolds with boundary. For more information on this topic, visit: http://www.theoryonmanifolds.org/supergravity.

## 5. Tools for Supergravity in the spin coframe formalism

**Authors:** Filippo Fila-Robattino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07355v1)

**Summary:**

A review of the theoretical foundations of Clifford algebras, spinors and spinor bundles in the so-called co-frame formalism. A compact index-free notation is introduced, along with a series of identities useful for computations in supergravity theories. The paper is published by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) in the form of an open-access book.

## 6. Compactification of Anisotropies in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet   Cosmology

**Authors:** Alex Giacomini, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Alexey Toporensky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes. We find that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe. The study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetime where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropIC configurations where all scale factors evolve identically.

## 7. Testing for Markovian character of transfer of fluctuations in solar   wind turbulence on kinetic scales

**Authors:** Dariusz Wójcik, Wiesław M. Macek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07255v1)

**Summary:**

Solar wind turbulence in the inertial range of large magnetohydrodynamic scales exhibits Markov properties. We have verified that the Chapman-Kolmogorov necessary conditions for Markov processes is satisfied for local transfer of energy between the magnetic and velocity fields also on kinetic scales. The obtained results are important for a better understanding of the physical mechanism governing turbulent systems in space and laboratory. The results are published in the open-access journal, The Astrophysics of Space and Air.

## 8. Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems

**Authors:** Andy Chia, Wai-Keong Mok, Leong-Chuan Kwek, Changsuk Noh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939v1)

**Summary:**

In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems could be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,.y) are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian.

## 9. The Dry Ten Martini Problem for $C^2$ cosine-type quasiperiodic   Schrödinger operators

**Authors:** Lingrui Ge, Yiqian Wang, Jiahao Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06918v1)

**Summary:**

This paper solves "The Dry Ten Martini Problem'' for $C^2$ cosine-type quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators with large coupling constants and Diophantine frequencies. This shows that the analyticity assumption on the potential is not essential for obtaining a dry Cantor spectrum and can be replaced by a certain geometric condition in the low regularity case. We prove the homogeneity of the spectrum and the absolute continuity of the integrated density of states (IDS)

## 10. An automatic approach to develop the fourth-order and L^2-stable lattice   Boltzmann model for diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equations

**Authors:** Ying Chen, Zhenhua Chai, Baochang Shi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06817v1)

**Summary:**

This paper discusses how to develop a high-order multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) model for the general d(>=1)-dimensional diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Such an MRT-LB model considers the transformation matrix constructed in a natural way and the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure. A key step in developing the high- order M RT- LB model is to determine the adjustable relaxation parameters and weight coefficients.
