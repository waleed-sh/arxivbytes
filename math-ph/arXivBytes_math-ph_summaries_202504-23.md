## 0. Upscaling the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard model for incompressible   multiphase flow in inhomogeneous porous media

**Authors:** Chunhua Zhang, Peiyao Liu, Cheng Peng, Lian-Ping Wang, Zhaoli Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16009v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we present a macroscopic model for the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids in inhomogeneous porous medium. At the pore scale, the flow is governed by the fully Navier-Stokes equations while the evolution of the phase interface is captured by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Using the volume averaging method, the upscaled equations describing the averaged behavior of two fluids at the Darcy scale are obtained, with unclosed terms related to spatial deviations.

## 1. Approximation of Invariant Solutions to the Nonlinear Filtration   Equation by Modified Pade Approximants

**Authors:** Sergii Skurativskyi, Sergiy Mykulyak, Inna Skurativska

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16001v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16001v1)

**Summary:**

This paper deals with a mathematical model for oil filtration in a porous medium and its self-similar and traveling wave regimes. The model consists of the equation for conservation mass and dependencies for porosity, permeability, and oil density on pressure. The approach provides relatively simple quasi-rational expressions of solutions and can be easily adapted for other types of model's nonlinearity. In fact, we calculate sequentially Pade approximants up to 3d order for a two-point boundary value problem on the semi-infinite domain.

## 2. Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity

**Authors:** Leron Borsten, Michael J. Duff, Dimitri Kanakaris, Hyungrok Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973v1)

**Summary:**

 Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. We show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-Muller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory. We propose a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearizedgravity and its dual.

## 3. GUE Fluctuations Near the Axis in One-Sided Ballistic Deposition

**Authors:** Pablo Groisman, Alejandro F. Ramírez, Santiago Saglietti, Sebastián Zaninovich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15837v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15837v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a variation of the classic ballistic deposition model in which vertically falling blocks can only stick to the top or the upper right corner of growing columns. We establish that the fluctuations of the height function at points near the $t$-axis are given by the GUE ensemble and its correspondent Tracy-Widom limiting distribution. The proof is based on a graphical construction of the process in terms of a directed Last Passage Percolation model. For more information, visit: http://www.sciencemag.org/.

## 4. An equivalence theorem for algebraic and functorial QFT

**Authors:** Severin Bunk, James MacManus, Alexander Schenkel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15759v1)

**Summary:**

This paper develops a novel approach to functorial quantum field theories (FQFTs) in the context of Lorentzian geometry. The key challenge is that globally hyperbolic LorentZian bordisms between two Cauchy surfaces cannot change the topology of the Cauchey surface. This is addressed and solved by introducing a more flexible concept of bordism pseudo-operad. The main result of this paper is an equivalence theorem between such globallyHyperbolic FQFTS and algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT)

## 5. Convergence to equilibrium distribution. Dirac fields coupled to a   particle

**Authors:** T. V. Dudnikova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15749v1)

**Summary:**

For a system consisting of several Dirac fields and a particle, we study the Cauchy problem with random initial data. We assume that the initial measure has zero mean value, a finite mean charge density, a translation-invariant covariance and satisfies a mixing condition. The main result is the long-time convergence of distributions of the random solutions to a limit Gaussian measure.

## 6. Zernike system revisited: imaginary gauge and Higgs oscillator

**Authors:** Vahagn Abgaryan, Armen Nersessian, Vahagn Yeghikyan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15713v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the non-reality of the classical Zernike Hamiltonian is an insignificant artifact of imaginary gauge and can be eliminated with a canonical transformation. The quantum counterpart of this canonical transformation is a similarity transformation mapping the system to the quantum Higgs oscillator with integration measure depending on parameters. When $\alpha=2 \beta$ it results in the Hermitian Hamiltonian describing a free particle on (pseudo)sphere, while deviation from this point leads to a pseudo-Hermitian system.

## 7. A new representation formula for the logarithmic corotational derivative   -- a case study in application of commutator based functional calculus

**Authors:** Michal Bathory, Miroslav Bulíček, Josef Málek, Vít Průša

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15692v1)

**Summary:**

The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarathmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logrithmic spin Tensor. We also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarethm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations.

## 8. Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The   Tunneling Of A Composite Particle

**Authors:** Pervez Hoodbhoy, M. Haashir Ismail, M. Mufassir

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15607v1)

**Summary:**

Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions.

## 9. Resonant tunneling effect for quantum walks on directed graphs

**Authors:** Kenta Higuchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15584v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum walks that depend smoothly on a small parameter are considered on directed graphs. The asymptotic behavior of the scattering matrix of the quantum walk as $\varepsilon\to+0$ is investigated. The scattering matrix does not converge to that for $0$ at points in the essential spectrum (the unit circle) The phenomenon resembling and extending the resonant tunneling effect is observed by analyzing this discrepancy through resonant states. It is shown that, in this limit, the scattering matrices do not converge.

## 10. Vielbein Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid flows on spherical   surfaces

**Authors:** Victor E. Ambrus, Elisa Bellantoni, Sergiu Busuioc, Alessandro Gabbana, Federico Toschi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574v1)

**Summary:**

The vielbein vector field encodes all details related to the geometry of the underlying spherical surface. The resulting Boltzmann equation exhibits inertial (geometric) forces that ensure that fluid particles follow paths that remain on the spherical manifold. We validate our numerical implementation against two analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations derived in this work. We assess the robustness of the scheme by simulating the compressible flow of an axisymmetric shockwave and analyzing vortex dynamics.

## 11. Cayley's First Hyperdeterminant is an Entanglement Measure

**Authors:** Isaac Dobes, Naihuan Jing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15511v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15511v1)

**Summary:**

Cayley's first hyperdeterminant is an entanglement measure on $2n$-qudits. It is a legitimate generalization of the concurrence and n-tangle. We show that the modulus of the hyperd determiningant and its square both vanish on separable $2m$- qudits, are LU invariants, and are non-increasing on average under LOCC. We then consider their convex roof extensions and show that they may in fact be viewed as entanglements measures on mixed states of $2 n$- Qubits.
