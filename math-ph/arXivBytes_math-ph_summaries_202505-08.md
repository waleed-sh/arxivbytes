## 0. Polynomial deformations of $sl(2)$ and unified algebraic framework for   solutions of a class of spin models

**Authors:** Siyu Li, Ian Marquette, Yao-Zhong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04426v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce novel polynomial deformations of the Lie algebra $sl(2)$. We construct their finite-dimensional irreducible representations and the corresponding differential operator realizations. We provide analytic and numerical insights into the structures of the roots of the Bethe ansatz equations (i.e. the so-called Bethe roots) of these models. We also present the fidelity and derivatives of the ground-state energies (with respect to model parameters) of the models. The results indicate the presence of critical points and phase transitions of the model.

## 1. $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading of the Lie algebra $G_2$ and related color   algebras

**Authors:** N. I. Stoilova, J. Van der Jeugt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04378v1)

**Summary:**

We present a special and attractive basis for the exceptional Lie algebra $G_2. There are two basis elements for each degree of the Lie algebra. We give a general and simple closed form expression for commutators between these basis elements. Next, we use this $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading in order to examine graded color algebras. Our analysis yields three different$-graded color algeses of type $G-2. We also study another grading, compatible with a Cartan-Weyl basis, and for which we can also construct a $G 2$ color algebra.

## 2. On local fields invariant under the action of topological defects

**Authors:** Anatoly Konechny, Vasileios Vergioglou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04316v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look into the problem of constructing and classifying pairs consisting of a local operator and a topological defect which commutes or anticommutes with it. In the case of the charge conjugation modular invariant commuting configurations in each problem can be obtained when a certain restriction on the fusion rules in realised. We obtain a full solution to this problem for the WZW theory, thus constructing a class of commuting boundary operators and junctions in that theory.

## 3. Extended states for the Random Schrödinger operator on $\mathbb{Z}^d$   ($d\geq 5$) with decaying Bernoulli potential

**Authors:** Shihe Liu, Yunfeng Shi, Zhifei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04077v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the delocalization property of the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H_\omega$ The proof is based on Green's function estimates via a $6$th-order renormalization scheme. Among the main new ingredients are the proof of a generalized Khintchine inequality via Bonami's lemma, and the application of the fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality to control a new type of non-random operators.

## 4. Dwork congruences via q-deformation

**Authors:** Pavan Kartik, Andrey Smirnov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04039v1)

**Summary:**

In the limit $q-$deformation of Dwork's congruences we recover the main result of arXiv:2302.03092v3. We consider a system of polynomials $T_{s}(z,q)$ which appear as truncations of the K-theoretic vertex function for the cotangent bundles over Grassmannians $T^{*}Gr(k,n)$. We prove that these polynmials satisfy a natural $q-deformation$ of the Dwork congruence.
