## 0. Useful trick to compute correlation functions of composite operators

**Authors:** Giovani Peruzzo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17138v1)

**Summary:**

In gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by gauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. We present a useful trick to compute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This trick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to the composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the traditional algorithms used to compute correlation function of elementary fields. We conclude that this trick is a useful way to compute loops in gauge field theory.

## 1. Equivariant localization in Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism

**Authors:** Alberto Cattaneo, Shuhan Jiang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17082v1)

**Summary:**

 and quantum field theory. We derive equivariant localization formulas of Atiyah--Bott and cohomological field theory types in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. We also discuss their applications in Poisson geometry and Quantum Field Theory. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for Poisson geometrics and Poisson quantum field theories. The results are based on the Atiyah-Bott formalism, which is a special form of the Batalin-vilkovinsky formalism for field theory of Poisson Geometry.

## 2. Spectral square roots of the multivector

**Authors:** Adolfas Dargys, Arturas Acus

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17063v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17063v1)

**Summary:**

The problem of multivector (MV) multiple square roots in real geometric Clifford algebras Cl(p,q) with symbolic coefficients is considered. The method to find multiple MV square roots that is based on R.Bott's periodicity table and matrix eigensystem is proposed. A number of examples is presented for multivectors in low, p+q<= 3, and higher dimensional Clifford al gebras, including 4D (anti)-Euclidean space and relativistic Cl(1,3) and Cl(3,1)

## 3. Two measurement bases are asymptotically informationally complete for   any pure state tomography

**Authors:** Tianfeng Feng, Tianqi Xiao, Yu Wang, Shengshi Pang, Farhan Hanif, Xiaoqi Zhou, Qi Zhao, M. S. Kim, Jinzhao Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17061v1)

**Summary:**

A minimum of four measurement bases is typically required to determine an arbitrary pure state. We prove that for any states generated by finite-depth Clifford + T circuits, just two measurement bases are sufficient. Since any pure state can be asymptotically approximated by a sequence of algebraic states with arbitrarily high precision, our scheme is referred to as informationally complete. Our scheme provides a theoretical guarantee for pure state tomography in the fault-tolerant quantum computing regime. It remains valid for mixed states with certain types of noises.

## 4. Local decay and asymptotic profile for the damped wave equation in the   asymptotically Euclidean setting

**Authors:** Rayan Fahs, Julien Royer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17056v1)

**Summary:**

In even dimensions we go beyond the optimal decay by providing the large time asymptotic profile, given by a solution of the free wave equation. In odd dimensions, we improve the best known estimates. The analysis mainly relies on a comparison of the corresponding resolvent with theresolvent of thefree problem for low frequencies. All the results hold for the damped wave equation with short range absorption index. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics.

## 5. Virtual bound states of the Pauli operator with an Aharonov-Bohm   potential

**Authors:** Marie Fialova, David Krejcirik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17029v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17029v1)

**Summary:**

A maximal realisation of the two-dimensional Pauli operator, subject to Aharonov--Bohm magnetic field, is investigated. Asymptotics of the weakly coupled eigenvalues, generated by electric (not necessarily self-adjoint) perturbations, are derived. Contrary to the case of the Pauli operators with regular magnetic potentials, it is shown that both components of the Pauli operator are critical. The results are published in the book "The Pauli Operator: A Theory and Theory of a Two-Dimensional Operator"

## 6. Stochastic multisymplectic PDEs and their structure-preserving numerical   methods

**Authors:** Ruiao Hu, Linyu Peng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16913v1)

**Summary:**

Stochastic multisymplectic systems are constructed by considering a stochastic extension to the variational formulation of partial differential equations. These results are the Stochastic analogues of those found in deterministic variational principles. We develop stochastically structure-preserving collocation methods for this class of stochastics multisyMPlectic systems. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through their application to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations featuring either stoChastic transport or stochast dispersion.

## 7. Enhanced Dissipation via Time-Dependent Velocity Fields: Acceleration   and Intermittency

**Authors:** Johannes Benthaus, Camilla Nobili

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16905v1)

**Summary:**

This work investigates enhanced dissipation in non-autonomous flows. We study the evolution of concentrations governed by the advection-diffusion equation. For this class, we demonstrate super-enhanced dissipation, characterized by energy decay rates faster than those observed in autonomous cases. In intermittent flows, the dissipation rates are comparable to those of autonomous flows but with modified constants. We analyse two prototypical intermittent flows: one that exhibits a gradual turn-on and turn-off phase and another that undergoes a significant acceleration following a slow initial activation phase.

## 8. Jordan-Holder property for shifted quantum affine algebras

**Authors:** David Hernandez, Huafeng Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16859v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that finite length representations of shifted quantum affine algebras are stable by fusion product. This implies that in the topological Grothendieck ring $K_0(\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}})$ the GrotheNDieck group of finite lengthrepresentations forms a non-topological subring. We also conjecture this subring is isomorphic to the cluster algebra discovered in GHL. In the course of our proofs, we establish that any simple representation in category $O$ descends to a truncation, for certain truncation parameters.

## 9. Networks of neural networks: more is different

**Authors:** Elena Agliari, Andrea Alessandrelli, Adriano Barra, Martino Salomone Centonze, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789v1)

**Summary:**

The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks. We show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs pattern disentanglement.

## 10. Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with   integer parameter $θ$

**Authors:** Dong Wang, Shuai-Xia Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746v1)

**Summary:**

We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. We prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma.

## 11. On the subcritical self-catalytic branching Brownian motions

**Authors:** Haojie Hou, Zhenyao Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16739v1)

**Summary:**

Self-catalytic branching Brownian motions (SBBM) arise as the moment duals of certain reaction-diffusion equations are perturbed by multiplicative space-time white noise. For the subcritical case of the catalytic branching mechanism, we construct the SBBM allowing an infinite number of initial particles. We establish the coming down from infinity (CDI) property for these systems and characterize their CDI rates. The SBBM is an extension of the classical one-dimensional branchingBrownian motions.
