## 0. R-matrix valued Lax pair for elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system and   associative Yang-Baxter equations of ${\rm BC}_n$ type

**Authors:** M. Matushko, A. Mostovskii, A. Zotov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22659v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system with five arbitrary constants. We propose $R$-matrix valued generalization for $2n\times 2n$ Takasaki's Lax pair. As a by-product we also propose a generalization of the XYZ long-range spin chain. We present arguments pointing to the integrability of this type of generalization. We conclude with an argument for the existence of a new type of elliptic system.

## 1. Lagrangian multiforms and dispersionless integrable systems

**Authors:** Evgeny V. Ferapontov, Mats Vermeeren

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22615v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22615v1)

**Summary:**

Lagrangian multiforms appear naturally in the theory of multidimensional dispersionless integrable systems. They appear in higher-order conservation laws of linearly degenerate PDEs in 3D, and in the context of Gibbons-Tsarev equations governing hydrodynamic reductions of heavenly type equations in 4D. We demonstrate that interesting examples of Lagrangian Multiforms can be found in the 4D context. We conclude that Lagrangians can be used to solve 4D equations.

## 2. Zero-homogeneous and $O(2)$-equivariant critical points of the   Oseen-Frank energy with multiple Frank constants

**Authors:** Luc Nguyen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22599v1)

**Summary:**

We give an existence and classification result for zero-homogeneous and $O(2)$-equivariant critical points of the Oseen-Frank energy with multiple Frank constants. These critical points carry a topological defect of degree one and are minimizing with respect to $O('s')$-Equivariant perturbations supported away from the axis of symmetry. We show that these critical points are minimized in the case of $O's' 's' perturbation.

## 3. CLT for LES of correlated Non-Hermitian Random Matrices

**Authors:** Indrajit Jana, Sunita Rani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22542v1)

**Summary:**

We consider two $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices. The entries of any particular matrix are i.i.d. random variables. We show that if the random variables are centered with variance $1/n$ and having finite moments, then the centered \textit{Linear Eigenvalue Statistics} converge jointly to a bivariate Gaussian distribution. This generalizes the previous results by Rider, Silverstein (2006), Cipolloni, Erd\H{o}s, Schr\"oder (2023)

## 4. Invariant Differential Operators for the Real Exceptional Lie Algebra   $F'_4$

**Authors:** V. K. Dobrev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22407v1)

**Summary:**

In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of invariant differential operators. We consider induction from a maximal parabolic algebra. We classify the reducible Verma modules over $F_4$ which are compatible with this induction. Thus, we obtain the classification of the corresponding invariant differential operators. We conclude that $F'_4=F_{4(4)$ is a split real form of the exceptional Lie algebra $F-4.

## 5. Reduction of hybrid Hamiltonian systems with non-equivariant momentum   maps

**Authors:** Leonardo Colombo, María Emma Eyrea Irazú, María Eugenia García, Asier López-Gordón, Marcela Zuccalli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22290v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a reduction scheme a la Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer for hybrid Hamiltonian systems. Our method does not require the momentum map to be equivariant, neither to be preserved by the impact map. We illustrate the applicability of our theory with an example of a superconducting superconductor. We conclude that our method can be used to solve problems involving superconductors and super-conductors in a variety of ways. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 6. On the scaling properties of quasicrystalline potentials of eightfold   rotational symmetry

**Authors:** A. Ya. Maltsev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22213v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a special class of quasi-periodic potentials arising in the physics of photonic systems and possessing rotational symmetry of the 8th order. We are interested in the growth rate of their closed level lines near the percolation threshold. Estimates of the corresponding scaling indices allow, in particular, to carry out some comparison of such potentials with various models of random potentials on the plane.

## 7. $\texttt{Symdyn}$: an automated algebraic solution for high-order   quantum systems

**Authors:** D. Martínez-Tibaduiza, Vladimir Vargas-Calderón, J. G. Dueñas, J. Flórez-Jiménez, A. Z. Khoury

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22061v1)

**Summary:**

Wei-Norman method provides a framework for determining the coefficients of the corresponding time evolution operator in its factorized representation. This work introduces a Python library that automates the application of this method for high-order quantum systems. The library efficiently computes similarity transformations and the nonlinear differential equations intrinsic to derive Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-like relations. We demonstrate its robustness by deriving the time evolution operators for a system of two time-dependent coupled harmonic oscillators.
