## 0. Quantization of Holomorphic Symplectic Manifolds: Analytic Continuation   of Path Integrals and Coherent States

**Authors:** Joshua Lackman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05428v1)

**Summary:**

We extend Berezin's quantization to holomorphic symplectic manifolds. We allow the states to be points in the cotangent bundle of a Grassmanian. We also define a holomorphic path integral quantization as a certain idempotent in a convolution algebra and we prove that these two quantizations are equivalent. Related to this, we show that the cotsangent bundles of Grassmanians have commuting almost complex structures that are compatible with a holomorphlectic form.

## 1. Edge modes in modulated metamaterials based on the three-gap theorem

**Authors:** Yinglai Wang, Bryn Davies, Marc Martí-Sabaté

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05402v1)

**Summary:**

We present a new paradigm for generating complex structured materials based on the three-gap theorem. Our model has both the discretised coupling strengths of the SSH model and a modulation parameter that can be used to characterise the spectral flow of edge modes. By defining a localisation factor associated to each eigenmode, we are able to establish conditions for the existence of localised edge states in finite systems. This allows us to compare their eigenfrequencies with the spectra of the corresponding infinitely periodic problem.

## 2. A New Approach to the Representation Theory of Lorentzian Pseudo-Tensors

**Authors:** Craig McRae

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05400v1)

**Summary:**

A novel approach to the finite dimensional representation theory of the entire Lorentz group is presented. It is shown that there are four physically meaningful representations of the group. There is a brief discussion of the time reversal of the electromagnetic field, concluding in agreement with standard texts such as Jackson, and works by Malament. The discussion concludes with the convenient representation Theory of generic tensor representations of $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$, namely that there is one representation of each of the four representations.

## 3. The Ising model: Highlights and perspectives

**Authors:** Christof Kuelske

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05394v1)

**Summary:**

This note is based on a talk given on 15 August 2024, as part of the Ising lecture during the 11th Bernoulli-IMS world congress, Bochum. We review some successes as well as challenges which have emerged from its study in probability and mathematical physics. This includes the infinite-volume theory of phase transitions, and ideas like scaling, renormalization group, universality, SLE, and random symmetry breaking in disordered systems and networks. We give a short non-technical introduction to theIsing model.

## 4. Hidden convexity and Dafermos' principle for some dispersive equations

**Authors:** Dmitry Vorotnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05389v1)

**Summary:**

We discover an abstract structure behind several nonlinear dispersive equations that is reminiscent of hyperbolic conservation laws. The underlying abstract problem admits an "entropy" that is formally conserved. The entropy is determined by a strictly convex function that naturally generates an anisotropic Orlicz space. No subsolution of the problems that fit into our framework is able to dissipate the total entropy earlier or faster than the strong solution. This result (we call it Dafermos' principle) is new even for "isotropic" problems such as the incompressible Euler system.

## 5. On the emergence of almost-honeycomb structures in low-energy planar   clusters

**Authors:** Marco Caroccia, Kenneth DeMason, Francesco Maggi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05373v1)

**Summary:**

The majority of chambers must be generalized polygons with six edges, and be closely resembling regular hexagons. Part of our arguments is a detailed revision of the estimates behind the global isoperimetric principle for honeycomb clusters due to Hales (T. C. Hales. The honeycomb conjecture. Discrete Computers. Geom., 25(1):1-22, 2001). In this paper, explicit quantitative estimates on the geometry of such low-energy configurations are provided.

## 6. The supercritical phase of the $\varphi^4$ model is well behaved

**Authors:** Trishen S. Gunaratnam, Christoforos Panagiotis, Romain Panis, Franco Severo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05353v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we analyse the $\varphi^4$ model on the supercritical regime. We consider a random cluster representation of the model, which corresponds to an Ising random cluster model on a random environment. The supercritical phase of this percolation model is well behaved in the sense that local uniqueness of macroscopic clusters happens with high probability, uniformly in boundary conditions. This result provides the basis for renormalisation techniques used to study several fine properties of thesupercritical phase.

## 7. Fermionic cellular automata in one dimension

**Authors:** Lorenzo S. Trezzini, Matteo Lugli, Paolo Meda, Alessandro Bisio, Paolo Perinotti, Alessandro Tosini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05349v1)

**Summary:**

Fermionic automata have been classified in terms of an index modulo circuits and the addition of ancillary systems. We consider quantum cellular automata for one-dimensional chains of Fermionic modes and study their implementability as finite depth quantum circuits. We strengthen this result removing the ancilla degrees of freedom in defining the equivalence classes. A complete characterization of nearest-neighbours automata is given. A class of automata can be found which cannot be expressed by single mode and controlled-phase gates composed with shifts.

## 8. Counting Equilibria of the Electrostatic Potential

**Authors:** Herbert Edelsbrunner, Christopher Fillmore, Gonçalo Oliveira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05315v1)

**Summary:**

A century and a half ago, James C. Maxwell conjectured that the number of zeroes of the electric field (equilibria of the potential) generated by a collection of $n$ point charges is at most $(n-1)^2$. In 2007 Gabrielov, Novikov, and Shapiro proved a much larger upper bound and posed two further conjectures. It is quite possible that Maxwell's quadratic upper bound is not tight, so it is prudent to find lower bounds.

## 9. Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension

**Authors:** Denis Périce, Shahnaz Farhat, Sören Petrat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05304v1)

**Summary:**

The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping. It serves as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivialmean-field equation. This mean- field equation does not only describe the condensate, but it allows for a phase transition to a MottInsulator since it contains the full non-Trivial interaction.

## 10. Semisimplifications and representations of the General Linear Supergroup

**Authors:** Thorsten Heidersdorf, Rainer Weissauer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05298v1)

**Summary:**

We study the semisimplification of the full karoubian subcategory generated by the irreducible finite dimensional representations of the algebraic supergroup $GL(m|n)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We show that there is a canonical decomposition $H_{m| n} \cong GL(m\!-\! n) \times H_{n|n}$, thereby reducing the determination of $H m n$ to the equal rank case.

## 11. Many body gravity and the bullet cluster

**Authors:** S. Ganesh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126v1)

**Summary:**

Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS) The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients. MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark Matter.

## 12. Duality, asymptotic charges and algebraic topology in mixed symmetry   tensor gauge theories

**Authors:** Federico Manzoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05104v1)

**Summary:**

In a recent paper the duality map between electric-like asymptotic charges of $p$-form gauge theories is studied. The outcome is an existence and uniqueness theorem. The goal of this work is to extend that theorem in the case of mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories. The crucial points are to view a mixed symmetry Tensor as a Young projected object of the $N$-multi-form space. As a result, if the underlying manifold satisfy appropriate conditions, the dualy map can be proven to exist.

## 13. Properties of the one-component Coulomb gas on a sphere with two   macroscopic external charges

**Authors:** Sung-Soo Byun, Peter J. Forrester, Sampad Lahiry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05061v1)

**Summary:**

The one- component Coulomb gas on the sphere is considered. It is in the presence of two external charges each of strength proportional to $N$ There are two spherical caps naturally associated with the external charges. This gives rise to two distinct phases depending on them not overlapping (post-critical) or overlapping (pre-critical). We determine the equilibrium measure in the pre-critical phase using a particular conformal map, with the parameters therein specified in terms of a root of a certain fourth order polynomial.

## 14. Quantum Birkhoff Normal Form in the $σ$-Bruno-Rüssmann   non-resonant condition

**Authors:** Huanhuan Yuan, Yixian Gao, Yong Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05041v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of this paper is to construct a Gevrey quantum Birkhoff normal form for the $h$-differential operator $P_{h}(t),$ in the neighborhood of the union $\Lambda$ of KAM tori. This construction commences from an appropriate Birkhoffs normal form of $H$ around $Lamda$ and proceeds under the $\sigma$-Bruno-R\"{u}ssmann condition with $sigma>1$.

## 15. Scatter correction based on quasi-Monte Carlo for CT reconstruction

**Authors:** Guiyuan Lin, Shiwo Deng, Xiaoqun Wang, Xing Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05039v1)

**Summary:**

Scatter signals can degrade the contrast and resolution of computed tomography (CT) images and induce artifacts. How to effectively correct scatter signals in CT has always been a focal point of research for researchers. This work presents a new framework for eliminating scatter artifacts in CT. In the reconstruction process, the impact of scatter signals on the X-ray energy spectrum is considered. A scatter-corrected spectrum estimation method is proposed and applied to estimate the energy spectrum. The effectiveness of the FDK-QMC-BM4D method is validated in the Shepp-Logan phantom and head.

## 16. Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error   Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties

**Authors:** Ke Wang, Xiantao Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05019v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05019v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. Prior investigations have predominantly focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose non-Markovian Noise Mitigation (NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions.
