## 0. On dual regime in Yang-Baxter deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models

**Authors:** Alexey Bychkov, Alexey Litvinov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22589v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we explore a new class of integrable sigma models, which we refer to as the "dual regime" of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ models. We identify the corresponding one-loop metric and $B-$field and show that they solve the generalized Ricci flow equation. In particular, we show that the new systems provide new perturbations of the sigma model type.

## 1. Discrete Boltzmann Equation for Anyons

**Authors:** Niclas Bernhoff

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22529v1)

**Summary:**

A semi-classical approach to the study of the evolution of anyonic excitations is through the Boltzmann equation for anyons. This work reviews a discretized version--a system of partial differential equations--of such a quantum equation. Trend to equilibrium is studied for a planar stationary system, as well as the spatially homogeneous system. Essential properties of the linearized operator are proven, implying that results for general steady half-space problems for the discrete Boltzman equation in a slab geometry can be applied.

## 2. Connectivity for quantum graphs via quantum adjacency operators

**Authors:** Kristin Courtney, Priyanga Ganesan, Mateusz Wasilewski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22519v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22519v1)

**Summary:**

Connectivity is a fundamental property of quantum graphs. In this paper, we develop an algebraic characterization of connectivity for general quantum graphs within the quantum adjacency matrix framework. These results are obtained using the KMS inner product, which unifies and generalizes existing formulations. We further characterize connectivity in terms of the irreducibility of the quantum Adacency Matrix and the nullity of the associated graph Laplacian. We utilize a quantum Perron-Frobenius theorem that provides a spectral characterization.

## 3. Comparative analysis of robust entanglement generation in engineered XX   spin chains

**Authors:** Eduardo K. Soares, G. D. de Moraes Neto, Fabiano M. Andrade

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22484v1)

**Summary:**

We present a numerical investigation comparing two entanglement generation protocols. Protocol 1 (P1) relies on staggered couplings to steer correlations toward the ends of the chain. Protocol 2 (P2) adopts a dual-port architecture that uses optimized boundary fields to mediate virtual excitations between terminal spins. Our results show that P2 consistently outperforms P1 in all spin values, generating higher-fidelity entangler in shorter timescales when evaluated under the same system parameters.

## 4. Spin transport and lack of quantisation in the $A\mathrm{II}$ class on   the honeycomb structure

**Authors:** Luca Fresta, Giovanna Marcelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22452v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22452v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate spin transport in a class of two-dimensional insulators on the honeycomb structure. We show that the spin conductivity is well-defined and independent of the choice of the spin current. For models that do not conserve the spin, we demonstrate that the deviation of the Spin conductivity from the quantised value is, at worst, quadratic in the spin-non-conserving terms. In general, there is no direct connection between the spin Conductivity and the Fu-Kane-Mele index.

## 5. Thermodynamical aspects of fermions in external electromagnetic fields

**Authors:** Romeo Brunetti, Klaus Fredenhagen, Nicola Pinamonti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22413v1)

**Summary:**

For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism. The time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution. The possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can also be investigated.

## 6. The Huang-Yang conjecture for the low-density Fermi gas

**Authors:** Emanuela L. Giacomelli, Christian Hainzl, Phan Thành Nam, Robert Seiringer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22340v1)

**Summary:**

The work establishes a three-term asymptotic expansion of the ground state energy of a dilute gas of spin $1/2$ fermions with repulsive short-range interactions. It validates a formula predicted by Huang and Yang in 1957. The formula is universal in the sense that it holds for a large class of interaction potentials and depends on those only via their scattering length. We have recently proved an upper bound on the groundState energy of the desired form. The present work completes the program by proving the matching lower bound.

## 7. Quantitative Tsirelson's Theorems via Approximate Schur's Lemma and   Probabilistic Stampfli's Theorems

**Authors:** Xiangling Xu, Marc-Olivier Renou, Igor Klep

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22309v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22309v1)

**Summary:**

In finite dimensions, quantum correlations generated by commuting observables are equivalent to those obtainable from measurements on separate tensor product factors. We establish two distinct quantitative approximate Tsirelson's theorems. Theorems arise from two different but complementary formulations of almost commutation. This provides a quantitative counterpart to the asymptotic result of [N. Ozawa, J. Math. Phys. 54, 032202 (2013)] and justifies the Tensor product model as an effective model.

## 8. Ageing correlators from local scale-invariance

**Authors:** Malte Henkel, Stoimen Stoimenov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22301v1)

**Summary:**

Form of the two-time autocorrelator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d>2$ dimensions. For ageing systems with dynamical exponent $mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise coming from the thermal bath, the form is more complex.

## 9. Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of   2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory

**Authors:** Qiang Jia, Zhian Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261v1)

**Summary:**

Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$- dimensional theory. We develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. We demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme for subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$

## 10. Surface plasmons in metamaterial cavities: Scattering by obstacles with   negative wave speed

**Authors:** Yan-Long Fang, Jeffrey Galkowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22253v1)

**Summary:**

We study scattering by metamaterials with negative indices of refraction. These are known to support surface plasmons, long-lived states that are highly localized at the boundary of the cavity. This type of states has found uses in a variety of modern technologies. We show that the corresponding resonances lie super-polynomially close to the real axis, and describe the localization properties of the corresponding Resonant states. We give an asymptotic formula for their number and show their localization properties.

## 11. Moduli of stable supermaps

**Authors:** Ugo Bruzzo, Daniel Hernández Ruipérez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22233v1)

**Summary:**

We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme. We prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by an algebraic superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the modulus superstack.

## 12. Soliton resolution for the coupled complex short pulse equation

**Authors:** Nan Liu, Ran Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22210v1)

**Summary:**

We address the long-time asymptotics of the solution to the Cauchy problem of ccSP (coupled complex short pulse) equation. The ccSP system describes ultra-short pulse propagation in optical fibers, which is a completely integrable system. The solution of the ccSP equation decays as a speed of $O(t^{-1})$ in the region $\zeta/t>\varepsilon$ with any $0$.

## 13. Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux   Quanta

**Authors:** Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144v1)

**Summary:**

Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH) are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers. The results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.   Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of F QH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory.

## 14. Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored   Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding

**Authors:** Hendra I. Nurdin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22070v1)

**Summary:**

An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations.

## 15. Two-dimensional equilibrium configurations in Korteweg fluids

**Authors:** M. Gorgone, F. Oliveri, A. Ricciardello, P. Rogolino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22026v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, after reviewing the form of the constitutive equations for a third grade Korteweg fluid, an equilibrium problem is investigated. By considering a two--dimensional setting, it is derived a single nonlinear elliptic equation such that the equilibrium conditions are identically satisfied. Such an equation is discussed both analytically and numerically. Also, by considering a particular boundary value problem of Dirichlet type, some preliminary numerical solutions are presented.
