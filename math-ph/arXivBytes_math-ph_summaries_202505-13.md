## 0. Quon Classical Simulation: Unifying Clifford, Matchgates and   Entanglement

**Authors:** Zixuan Feng, Zhengwei Liu, Fan Lu, Ningfeng Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07804v1)

**Summary:**

Quon Classical Simulation (QCS) is built upon the diagrammatic formalism of the Quon language. Central to this framework is the introduction of magic holes, a topological feature that captures the global source of computational hardness in simulating quantum systems. Unlike conventional measures, the complexity of QCS is governed by the topological entanglement entropy associated with these magic holes. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of classical simulations and provides a unified explanation for the tractability of various known quantum circuit classes.

## 1. Rigidity and flexibility in $p$-adic symplectic geometry

**Authors:** Luis Crespo, Álvaro Pelayo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07663v1)

**Summary:**

Let $n\ge 2$ be an integer and let $p$ be a prime number. We prove that the analog of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem does not hold for $ p$-adic embeddings. We will also show that in the non-linear situation, if the $p $-adic embeddeddings are equivariant with respect to a torus action, then non-Squeezing holds. This allows us to introduce equivariants $p#-adic analytic symplectic capacities.

## 2. On the Novikov problem for dihedral symmetry potentials

**Authors:** A. Ya. Maltsev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07657v1)

**Summary:**

We consider Novikov's problem of describing level lines of quasiperiodic functions on a plane for two-dimensional potentials of dihedral symmetry. It is shown that quasipers of this type can have open level lines only at a single energy level. This brings them close to random potentials on a planes, which is why they are called potentials. We also show that they can only have open lines at one energy level, not multiple energy levels. We conclude that they are potentials with a single open level line.

## 3. Second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids and associated   cylindrical flows

**Authors:** C. Balitactac, C. Rodriguez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07617v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce second- gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids. We propose a new and simple constitutive relation for the hyperpressure. The framework is further extended to incorporate pressure-dependent viscosities. We show that the inclusion of second-gradient effects guarantees the ellipticity of the governing pressure equation, in contrast to previous models rooted in classical continuum mechanics. The constant viscosity model is applied to steady cylindrical flows, where explicit solutions are derived under both strong and weak adherence boundary conditions.

## 4. Construction of solutions of Toda lattices by the classical moment   problem

**Authors:** Alexander Mikhaylov, Victor Mikhaylov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07589v1)

**Summary:**

We use formulas of J. Moser for a finite-dimensional Toda lattices. We derive the evolution law for moments of the spectral measure of the semi-infinite Jacobi operator. This allows us to construct solutions for a wide class of unbounded initial data. We use well-known results from the classical moment problem theory. We conclude that the lattices can be constructed from a finite class of initial data by using the formula of Moser. The lattices are called Toda-Lattices and they can be built from unbounded data.

## 5. Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Along Quantum Markov Semigroups

**Authors:** Melchior Wirth

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07549v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07549v1)

**Summary:**

We establish the equivalence between exponential decay of the relative entropy along a quantum Markov semigroup and the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for general von Neumann algebras. We also extend an intertwining criterion to GNS-symmetric quantumMarkov semigroups on infinite-dimensional von Neumann algebraes. We conclude that this equivalence holds for all general von Neumann algebrae and all GNS symmetry sigroups.

## 6. An Approximation Framework for Subspace-based Methods in Spectral   Analysis with Accuracy Guarantees

**Authors:** Timothy Stroschein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07513v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07513v1)

**Summary:**

A mathematical framework for the approximation of eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators through subspace-based methods is presented. The framework contains spectral inequalities that extend to unbounded operators and account for multiple error sources. The generality of the framework invites application to a broad class of numerical methods, and its utility is demonstrated through recent advances in signal processing. We include conceptual remarks, on how such framework addresses contemporary challenges towards a more complete approximation theory for quantum physics.   Further analysis considers the computational operation of sub space-based method and proposes new numerical practices.

## 7. Chern-Simons potentials of higher-dimensional Pontryagin densities

**Authors:** Onur Ayberk Çakmak, Özgür Sarıoğlu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the Chern-Simons potentials given the Pontryagin densities in arbitrary even dimensions. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general and allows for non-metricity. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern Simons potential of thePontryagin density given an arbitrary even dimension.

## 8. Inverse problem for wave equation of memory type with acoustic boundary   conditions: Global solvability

**Authors:** Zhanna D. Totieva, Kush Kinra, Manil T. Mohan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07405v1)

**Summary:**

We study the one-dimensional inverse problem of determining the memory kernel by the integral overdetermination condition for the direct problem of finding the velocity potential and the displacement of boundary points. A wave equation with initial and acoustic boundary conditions in media with dispersion is used as a mathematical model. The inverse problem is reduced to an equivalent problem with homogeneous boundary conditions for the system of integro-differential equations. Using the technique of estimating integral equations and the contraction mappings principle in Sobolev spaces, the global existence and uniqueness theorem for the inverse Problem is proved.

## 9. Iterative Relaxation Method to Obtain Global Transonic Flows around   Compact Objects

**Authors:** Shilpa Sarkar, I. M. Kulikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07397v1)

**Summary:**

Flows around compact objects are necessarily transonic. Due to their dissipative nature, finding of sonic points is not trivial. An interplay between heating and cooling process, along with gravity and centrifugal forces gives rise to multiple sonic points and hence shocks. The proposed methodology successfully generates any class of accretion as well as wind solutions, allowing us to unify the two types of flows. We report here rigorously the mathematical aswell as the computational algorithm needed, to find sonic point(s) and thus obtain global transonic flows.

## 10. Irreducible Killing and conformal Killing tensors on homogeneous plane   waves

**Authors:** Jan Gregorovič, Lenka Zalabová

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07368v1)

**Summary:**

This paper presents a classification of irreducible Killing and conformal Killing 2-tensors on homogeneous plane waves. Using the framework of BGG operators, we derive explicit formulae for these tensors and identify the conditions under which they exist. We also identify a specific class of Lorentzian metrics on four-dimensional manifolds. The paper is published in the online edition of the Journal of Applied Theoretical Physics, published by Oxford University Press. For more information, visit the website.

## 11. The weak coupling limit of the Pauli-Fierz model

**Authors:** Fumio Hiroshima

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07253v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the weak coupling limit of the Pauli- Fierz Hamiltonian within a mathematically rigorous framework. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic behavior of the effective mass in this regime. We conclude by looking at the behavior of the effective mass in the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian regime. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, Los Angeles, in association with the California Institute of Technology.
