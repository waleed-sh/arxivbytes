## 0. On spectral stability of one- and bi-frequency solitary waves in Soler   model in (3+1)D

**Authors:** Nabile Boussaïd, Andrew Comech, Niranjana Kulkarni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21170v1)

**Summary:**

 waves can also possess linear stability properties similar to those of one-frequency solitary waves. For the nonlinear Dirac equation with scalar self-interaction (the Soler model) in three spatial dimensions, we consider the linearization at solitary wave solutions. We find the invariant spaces which correspond to different spherical harmonics, thus achieving the radial reduction of the spectral stability analysis. We apply the same technique to the bi- frequency solitary waves (which are generically present in the Soler models)

## 1. From Painlevé equations to ${\cal N}=2$ susy gauge theories:   prolegomena

**Authors:** Davide Fioravanti, Marco Rossi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21148v1)

**Summary:**

We study the linear problems in $z,t$ (time) associated to the Painlev\'e III$_3$ and III#3$ equations. We conjecture that this link holds for any Painlev’s equation relating each of them to a different matter theory. An explicit expression for the dual gauge period (and then prepotential) is also found. As a by-product, a new solution to the connexion problem is illustrated. The equations appear as Nekrasov-Shatashvili quantisations/deformations of Seiberg-Witten differentials for $SU(2)$

## 2. Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture

**Authors:** Li Gan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21128v1)

**Summary:**

We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$ This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian. We propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory. The conjecture is that square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walked are associated with local $mathcal{B}_3$

## 3. A polynomial affine model of gravity: after ten years

**Authors:** Oscar Castillo-Felisola, Bastian Grez, Manuel Morocho-López, Jose Perdiguero, Aureliano Skirzewski, Jefferson Vaca, Nicolas Zambra-Gómez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21122v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21122v1)

**Summary:**

The polynomial affine model of gravity was proposed as an alternative to metric and metric-affine gravitational models. It contains all possible combinations of the fields compatible with the covariance under diffeomorphisms. Here, we present a review of the advances in the analysis of the model after ten years of its proposal. We sketch the guideline of our future perspectives for the future of the field of gravitational theory and the theory of gravity in general. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.

## 4. Ordinary limits of the hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities

**Authors:** Mustafa Mullahasanoglu, Ali Mert T. Yetkin, Reyhan Yumusak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21108v1)

**Summary:**

The computation of the partition function of supersymmetric gauge theories on compact manifolds can be reduced to matrix integrals. We derive new ordinary hypergeometric identities from the reduction of certain hyperbolichypergeometric integral identities obtained via supers asymmetric infrared dualities. We also develop new complicated identities for this type of special function.

## 5. Quantum tunneling and its absence in deep wells and strong magnetic   fields

**Authors:** Charles L. Fefferman, Jacob Shapiro, Michael I. Weinstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21100v1)

**Summary:**

We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigen Value splitting. The results are published in the Journal of Magnetic Theory.

## 6. Quasi-classical expansion of a hyperbolic solution to the star-star   relation and multicomponent 5-point difference equations

**Authors:** Andrew P. Kels

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21096v1)

**Summary:**

Quasi-classical expansion of a multicomponent spin solution of the star-star relation with hyperbolic Boltzmann weights is investigated. The equations obtained in a quasi- classical limit provide n-1- component extensions of certain scalar 5-point equations (corresponding to n=2) that were previously investigated by the author in the context of integrability and consistency of equations on face-centered cubics. The results are published in a book called The Star-Star Relativistic Equations.

## 7. The 3BF theory as a TQFT

**Authors:** Tijana Radenkovic, Marko Vojinovic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032v1)

**Summary:**

We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. This state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) We provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQ FT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.

## 8. Oscillator Calculus on Coadjoint Orbits and Index Theorems

**Authors:** Dmitri Bykov, Viacheslav Krivorol, Andrew Kuzovchikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21024v1)

**Summary:**

We consider quantum mechanical systems of spin chain type, with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We prove that they are natural truncations of 1D sigma models. The problem of finding the exact spectra of generalized Laplace operators on such orbits is shown to be equivalent to the diagonalization ofspin chain Hamiltonians. We compute the Witten indices of these finite- dimensional models showing that they reproduce the Dolbeault and de Rham indices of the target space. We conclude that these models are equivalent to 1D spin chain models.

## 9. On Analytical Solutions in Witten's Cubic Open String Field Theory

**Authors:** Ilmar Gahramanov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20981v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20981v1)

**Summary:**

This short review is based on the lecture given by the author at the Feza Gursey Physics Days School 2024. Here we briefly review analytic solutions (in particular, the Erler-Schnabl solution) of open cubic string field theory for the tachyon vacuum. We also briefly discuss some of the issues raised in the lecture, such as how to deal with the vacuum in the theory of string fields. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the results for our understanding of string theory.

## 10. Entanglement in bipartite X-states: Analytical results for the volume of   states with positive partial transpose

**Authors:** Yaqing Xy Wang, József Zsolt Bernád

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20979v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20979v1)

**Summary:**

We provide an analytical formula for the volume ratio between bipartite X-states with positive partial transpose. The result applies to arbitrary $m \times n$-bipartite systems and the volume expressions are derived with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure. The volume ratio is the ratio of the number of bipartites to the total number of X- states in the system. We use the formula to calculate the volume of a bipartITE X-state in a system with a positive partialtranspose.

## 11. Spiralling branes, affine qq-characters and elliptic integrable systems

**Authors:** Yegor Zenkevich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20926v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the spiralling branes technique introduced in arXiv:2312.16990 to many-body integrable systems. We give a new R-matrix description of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider (RS) Hamiltonians and eigenfunctions using the intertwiners of quantum toroidal algebra. We then consider elliptic deformations of the RS system, elucidate how Shiraishi functions appear naturally in the process and relate them to certain special infinite system of intertwiners.

## 12. Quantum lattice transport along an infinitely extended perturbation

**Authors:** Marzieh Baradaran, Pavel Exner, Andrii Khrabustovskyi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20919v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a periodic quantum graph in the form of a rectangular lattice. We analyze the band spectrum of the system and show that it remains preserved as a set. For all the other combinations additional band appear in some or all gaps of the unperturbed system. We also prove that for a randomly chosen positive energy, the probability of existence of a state exponentially localized in the vicinity of the perturbation equals $\frac12$. We conclude by showing that for all other combinations, the system remains preserved.

## 13. The Speed of Convergence with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Metric   in the Soshnikov Central Limit Theorem for the Sine-Process

**Authors:** Alexander I. Bufetov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20910v1)

**Summary:**

For rescaled additive functionals of the sine-process, upper bounds are obtained for their speed of convergence to the Gaussian distribution. Under scaling with coefficient $R$ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is bounded from above by $c/\log R$ for a smooth function. For a function holomorphic in a horizontal strip, the distance is $c/R$ under scaling with coefficients $R, $C, $D, $R.

## 14. Parametrized topological phases in 1d and T-duality

**Authors:** Roman Geiko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20905v1)

**Summary:**

There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes.

## 15. The Expectation of a Multiplicative Functional under the Sine-Process

**Authors:** Alexander I. Bufetov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20902v1)

**Summary:**

Expected value of a regularized multiplicative functional under the sine-process is obtained by passing to the scaling limit in the Borodin-Okounkov-Geronimo-Case formula. An explicit expression for the expected value is given by the following formula. The formula is based on the formula for a multiplicative function with the exponent  of 1 or 2 expressed in terms of a regularized multiplicative function with the factor of 1.

## 16. Tensor structure on the module category of the triplet superalgebra   $\mathcal{SW}(m)$

**Authors:** Hiromu Nakano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20898v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20898v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the tensor structure on the category of modules of the $N=1$ triplet vertex operator superalgebra. We construct solutions of a Fuchsian differential equation using the theory of the Dotsenko-Fateev integrals developed by Sussman. We determine the structure of fusion products between the simple and projective $\mathcal{SW}(m)$- modules. We show that the Tensor supercategory on $N+1$-mod is rigid.

## 17. Asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference   maps

**Authors:** Mark Edelman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20877v1)

**Summary:**

The first step in investigating fractional difference maps, which do not have periodic points except fixed points, is to find asymptotically periodic points and bifurcation points. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for coefficients of the equations that allow calculations of asymptic periodic points in fractional Difference Maps. We also draw asymPTotic b ifurcation diagrams for the first time in this paper. The paper is published in the online edition of the Journal of Applied Mathematics.

## 18. Level crossing instabilities in inviscid isothermal compressible Couette   flow

**Authors:** Govind S. Krishnaswami, Sonakshi Sachdev, Pritish Sinha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20813v1)

**Summary:**

We study the linear stability of inviscid steady parallel flow of an ideal gas in a channel of finite width. The eigenvalue problem governing density and velocity perturbations is a compressible version of Rayleigh's equation. We find an infinite tower of noninflectional eigenmodes and derive stability theorems and bounds on growth rates. For a given eigenmode, they are arranged in a zebra-like striped pattern on the $k$-$M$ plane.

## 19. Dynamical system describing cloud of particles in relativistic and   non-relativistic framework

**Authors:** Robert Stańczy, Dorota Bors

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20791v1)

**Summary:**

We consider fairly general class of dynamical systems under the assumptions guaranteeing the existence of Lyapunov function around some nontrivial stationary point. The existence of heteroclinic trajectory is proved motivated by integrated densities approach to some astrophysical models of self-gravitating particles. We find the upper bounds for this trajectory yielding the critical mass--radius theorem for the astrophysical model.

## 20. Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin   chains

**Authors:** Kangle Li, Liujun Zou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20765v1)

**Summary:**

The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entangler and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy is compatible with these symmetries.

## 21. Generating and Computing Quantum Periods in Exact WKB

**Authors:** Max Meynig

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20643v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20643v1)

**Summary:**

Rational integrals appear in quantum mechanics through asymptotic expansions of traces computed with the semiclassical symbol calculus. In particular, a novel formal series expansion for the trace of the Dirac delta of the quantization of a polynomial Hamiltonian is developed. Reducing these integrals modulo total derivatives results in a novel formula for normal forms of the integrals. In the case of one degree of freedom, the two dimensional residue formula relates the rational integrals to the quantum actions in the exact WKB formalism.

## 22. Direct and inverse spectral problems for the Schrodinger operator with   double generalized Regge boundary conditions

**Authors:** Xiao-Chuan Xu, Yu-Ting Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20642v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20642v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the direct and inverse spectral problems for the Schrodinger operator with two generalized Regge boundary conditions. For the direct problem, we give the properties of the spectrum, including the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues. We prove several uniqueness theorems, including cases: even potential, two-spectra, as well as the general partial inverse problem. The paper is published in the online edition of the Journal of Applied Mathematics, published by Oxford University Press.
