**Authors:** Antonio Barletta, Pedro Vayssière Brandão, Florinda Capone, Roberta De Luca

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03990v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03990v1)

**Summary:**

This work investigates the influence of a generic anomalous diffusion model on mass convection in a fluid-saturated porous medium. The paper systematically examines various memory functions, including power-law, exponential, and logarithmic forms, highlighting their impact on the dynamics of disturbances. The findings underscore the importance of anomalous. diffusion in modulating stability and provide new insights into the transient behaviours induced by non-Fickian. mass transport. The study was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

## 1. Mixing times for the open ASEP at the triple point

**Authors:** Patrik L. Ferrari, Dominik Schmid

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03951v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03951v1)

**Summary:**

We consider mixing times for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) at the triple point. We show that the mixing time of the open ASEP on a segment of length $N$ for bias parameter $q$ is of order $N^{3/2+\kappa}$ We also establish a comparison between moderate deviations for the current of theOpen and the A SEP on the integers. We also show bounds on mixing times in the weakly high density phase of the ASEP.

## 2. Essentially Commuting with a Unitary

**Authors:** Jui-Hui Chung, Jacob Shapiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03934v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03934v1)

**Summary:**

Let $R$ be a unitary operator whose spectrum is the circle. We show that the set of unitaries $U$ which essentially commute with $R $ (i.e., $[U,R]\equiv UR-RU$ is compact) is path-connected. We also calculate the set. of orthogonal projections that essentially commute and obey a non-triviality. condition, and prove it is bijective with $\mathbb{Z}$.

## 3. Dynamical space-time ray tracing and modified horizontal ray method

**Authors:** Aleksandr Kaplun, Boris Katsnelson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03856v1)

**Summary:**

The 'vertical modes and horizontal rays' method, commonly applied for simulating acoustic wave propagation in shallow water is advanced in this research. Our approach to this method involves the use of the so-called space-time rays, which are constructed by decomposing the time-dependent sound field into adiabatic vertical modes. The introduction of the time coordinate, while still considering it as an additional space coordinate instead of merely a parameter along the ray, allows us to describe the propagation of frequency-modulated signals in an effectively frequency-dispersive medium.

## 4. Bekenstein Bound for Approximately Local Charged States

**Authors:** Stefan Hollands, Roberto Longo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03849v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the energy-entropy ratio inequality in quantum field theory (QFT) from localized states to a larger class of states. The states considered in this paper can be in a charged (non-vacuum) representation of the QFT or may be only approximately localized in the region under consideration. Our inequality is $S(\Psi |\!| \Omega) \le 2\pi R \, ( \Psi, H_\rho \ Psi ) + \log d(\rho) + \varepsilon$, where $S$ is the relative entropy.

## 5. Concentration of Empirical First-Passage Times

**Authors:** Rick Bebon, Aljaz Godec

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03810v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03810v1)

**Summary:**

First-passage properties are central to the kinetics of target-search processes. Obtaining trustworthy estimates from under-sampled data and unknown underlying dynamics remains a daunting task. In this chapter, we highlight recent progress in understanding and controlling finite-sample effects in empirical first- passage times of reversible Markov processes. We present two-sided bounds on the range of fluctuations, i.e., deviations of the expected maximum and minimum from the mean in any given sample, which control uncertainty even in situations where the mean is not a sufficient statistic.

## 6. Controlling the low-temperature Ising model using spatiotemporal Markov   decision theory

**Authors:** M. C. de Jongh, Richard J. Boucherie, M. N. M. van Lieshout

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03668v1)

**Summary:**

The spatiotemporal Markov decision process (STMDP) models sequential decision-making problems. We construct an STMDP inspired by the low-temperature two-dimensional Ising model on a finite, square lattice. We uncover the structure of the optimal policy by solving the Bellman equations in a recursive manner. We conduct a numerical study on the performance of the ideal policy obtained from the auxiliary MDP in the original Ising STM DP. The results of the study are published in the open-access issue of the journal Theoretical and Applied Physics.

## 7. Analyticity of the pressure function for products of matrices

**Authors:** Arnaud Hautecœur

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03590v1)

**Summary:**

The pressure function is a fundamental object in various areas of mathematics. Its regularity is studied to derive insights into phase transitions in certain physical systems or to determine the Hausdorff dimension of self-affine sets. In this paper, we prove the analyticity of the pressure function for products of non-invertible matrices satisfying an irreducibility and a contractivity assumptions. Additionally, we establish a variational principle for the pressurefunction, thereby generalizing previous results.

## 8. On Large-Space and Long-Time Asymptotic Behaviors of Kink-Soliton Gases   in the Sine-Gordon Equation

**Authors:** Guoqiang Zhang, Weifang Weng, Zhenya Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03493v1)

**Summary:**

We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the large-space and long-time asymptotics of kink-soliton gases in the sine-Gordon (sG) equation. Unlike in the KdV equation, the sG presents unique challenges for \(g\)-function formulation, particularly concerning the singularity at the origin. The Riemann-Hilbert problem also requires carefully constructed local parametrices near endpoints \(\eta_j\) and the singularhip \(\eta-0\). At the endpoints, we employ a modified Bessel parametrix.

## 9. On the $N_\infty$-soliton asymptotics for the modified Camassa-Holm   equation with linear dispersion and vanishing boundaries

**Authors:** Weifang Weng, Zhenya Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03485v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the $N_{\infty}$-soliton asymptotics for the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with linear dispersion and boundaries vanishing at infinity. We mainly analyze the aggregation state of $N$-Soliton solutions of the mCH equation expressed by the solution of the modified Riemann-Hilbert problem in the new $(y,t)$-space when the discrete spectra are located in different regions.

## 10. Breather gas and shielding for the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger   equation with nonzero backgrounds

**Authors:** Weifang Weng, Guoqiang Zhang, Boris A. Malomed, Zhenya Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481v1)

**Summary:**

Breathers have been experimentally and theoretically found in many physical systems. A relevant problem is to study the limit, for $N\rightarrow \infty $, of $N$-breather solutions. In this paper, we investigate the breather gas in the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with nonzero boundary conditions, using the inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert problem. These results may be useful to design experiments with breathers in physical settings.
