## 0. Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of   plastic flow in copper single crystals

**Authors:** Afonso D. M. Barroso, Elijah Borodin, Andrey P. Jivkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08689v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08689v1)

**Summary:**

Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

## 1. Probing the Universe's Topology through a Quantum System?

**Authors:** Evangelos Achilleas Paraskevas, Leandros Perivolaropoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08603v1)

**Summary:**

The global topology of the Universe could, in principle, affect quantum systems through boundary condition constraints. We investigate how compact, flat, cosmologically inspired topologies influence the energy eigenvalues of a quantum particle in the bound state of a 3D Dirac delta potential. Using the three dimensional Dirac potential as a toy model, we show that at the current cosmic epoch ($a=1$), these topological effects are exponentially suppressed. Such effects may become measurable in the early Universe, when the physical size of the particle horizon is comparable to the characteristic scale of the quantum system.

## 2. Dynamic inverse problem for the one-dimensional system with memory

**Authors:** A. E. Choque-Rivero, A. S. Mikhaylov, V. S. Mikhaylov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08355v1)

**Summary:**

We study the inverse dynamic problem of recoverying the potential in the one-dimensional dynamical system with memory. The Gelfand--Levitan equations are derived for the kernel of the integral operator which is inverse to the control operator of the system. The potential is reconstructed from the solution of these equations. We show that the potential can be recovered from the kernel by solving the Gelf and Levitan equations for the system's kernel of integral operator. We also show that it is possible to recover the potential from a memory-based system.

## 3. Interaction anomalies and one-particle dynamics in very special   relativity theories

**Authors:** Manuel Asorey, Fernando Falceto, Giuseppe Marmo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08329v1)

**Summary:**

It is well known that relativistic invariance introduce strong constraints in the interactions of classical particles. We generalize the non-interaction theorems for Lorentz violating systems which still preserve a subgroup of Poincar\'e symmetry. In particular we analize the case of very special relativity introduced by Cohen and Glashow. We also extend the analysis for Galilei invariant multiparticle systems and for some anisotropic systems which are still invariant under some maximal subgroups of Galilei group.

## 4. Weak coupling limit for quantum systems with unbounded weakly commuting   system operators

**Authors:** Ilya Lopatin, Alexander Pechen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08241v1)

**Summary:**

This work is devoted to a rigorous analysis of the weak coupling limit (WCL) for the reduced dynamics of an open infinite-dimensional quantum system. We prove that the resulting reduced system dynamics converges to unitary dynamics (such behavior sometimes called as Quantum Cheshire Cat effect) We obtain exact form of the modified Hamiltonian and estimate the rate of convergence to the limiting dynamics. For Fermi reservoir, we prove the convergence of the full Dyson series. For Bose case the convergence is understood term by term.

## 5. Correlators in two rainbow tensor and complex multi-matrix models

**Authors:** Bei Kang, Lu-Yao Wang, Ke Wu, Wei-Zhong Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08132v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08132v1)

**Summary:**

We construct two rainbow tensor models with multi-tensors of rank-$3$ and present their $W$-representations. We give the formula of counting number of independent gauge-invariant operators in terms of Hurwitz numbers. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between connected operators and colored Dessins. We derive two compact expressions of correlators for each of rainbow Tensor models. Two complex multi-matrix models from the degradations of the constructed rainbow Tensors are also discussed.
