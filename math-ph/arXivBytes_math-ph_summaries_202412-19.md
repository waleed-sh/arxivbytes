## 0. Planar rooted line arrangements and an operad for factorized scattering

**Authors:** Denis Bashkirov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14157v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce two topological non-$\Sigma$ operad structures on planar line arrangements subject to a certain geometric order condition. This ensures a well-defined notion of particle ordering on a distinguished line. This is interpreted in terms of scattering diagrams in purely elastic (1+1)-dimensional theories. We discuss a possible approach to factorized scattering in operadic terms. We conclude with a discussion of the theory of scattering in the form of a topological scattering diagram. The paper is published by the University of California, San Diego.

## 1. Orbital instability of periodic waves for generalized Korteweg-de   Vries-Burgers equations with a source

**Authors:** Anna Naumkina, Ramón G. Plaza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14041v1)

**Summary:**

A family of generalized Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equations in one space dimension with a nonlinear source is considered. On one hand, the local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem on periodic Sobolev spaces and the regularity of the data-solution map are established. On the other hand, it is proved that periodic traveling waves which are spectrally unstable are also orbitally (nonlinearly) unstable under the flow of the evolution equation.

**Authors:** Karen Yeats

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14036v1)

**Summary:**

The causal set theory d'Alembertian has rational coefficients for which alternating expressions are known. Here, a combinatorial interpretation of these numbers is given. For example, the coefficients of the causal set can be written as: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,

## 3. Turbulent solutions of the binormal flow and the 1D cubic Schrödinger   equation

**Authors:** Valeria Banica, Luis Vega

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14013v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14013v1)

**Summary:**

In the last three decades there is an intense activity on the exploration of turbulent phenomena of dispersive equations. In a series of papers of the last six years that we survey here for the special issue of the ICMP 2024 we considered the binormal flow. We displayed rigorously a large range of complex behavior as creation of singularities and unique continuation, Fourier growth, Talbot effects, intermittency and multifractality, justifying in particular some previous numerical observations. To do so we constructed a class of well-posedness for the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation included in the critical Fourier-Lebesgue space.

## 4. Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored   Statistics

**Authors:** Alessia Gentili, Rainer Klages, Giorgio Volpe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960v1)

**Summary:**

Anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an elusive ground truth. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools.

## 5. Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems

**Authors:** Habib Ammari, Silvio Barandun, Alexander Uhlmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13954v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13954v1)

**Summary:**

We consider disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators where disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators and their material parameters are perturbed randomly. We elucidate the mechanism of wave localisation in such systems. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators. We show the existence of bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken. We highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion.

## 6. A purely geometrical Aharonov-Bohm effect

**Authors:** Jean-Pierre Gazeau, Tomoi Koide, Romain Murenzi, Aidan Zlotak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13919v1)

**Summary:**

The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge potential is generated by an infinite coil. This finding suggests that the AB effect originates from the topology enforced by the impenetrable coil, rather than from a classical gauge potential. Our results offer a novel perspective on the AB Effect, emphasizing the fundamental role of topology in quantum mechanics. The study was published in the journal Theoretical Physics and Applied Physics (TPAP). For more information, visit the TPAP website.

## 7. Higher-spin symmetry in the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda conformal   field theory

**Authors:** Baptiste Cerclé, Nathan Huguenin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13874v1)

**Summary:**

This article is dedicated to studying the symmetries enjoyed by the probabilistic construction of the Toda Conformal Field Theory. Namely we show that this model enjoys higher-spin symmetry in the form of Ward identities. We also show that specific Vertex Operators called degenerate fields give rise to singular vectors, which become higher equations of motion. As a corollary we obtain BPZ-type differential equations satisfied by a family of correlation functions, which were unknown in the physics literature.

## 8. Local enhancement of the mean-field approximation for bosons

**Authors:** Marius Lemm, Simone Rademacher, Jingxuan Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13868v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quantum many-body dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate. We derive a local enhancement of the mean-field approximation. This is a consequence of new ballistic propagation bounds on the fluctuations. We develop a variant of the ASTLO (adiabatic spacetime localization observable) method for the particle non-conserving generator of the fluctuation dynamics around Hartree states. For arbitrarily large $n\geq 1$ we show that this is the case.

## 9. Minimum nonlinearity for pattern-forming Turing instability in a   mathematical autocatalytic model

**Authors:** Javier López-Pedrares, Marcos Suárez-Vázquez, Juan Pérez-Mercader, Alberto P. Muñuzuri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13783v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13783v1)

**Summary:**

 Pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature and the mechanism widely-accepted to underlay them is based on the Turing instability, predicted by Alan Turing decades ago. This is a non-trivial mechanism that involves nonlinear interaction terms between the different species involved and transport mechanisms. We present here a mathematical analysis aiming to explore the mathematical constraints that a reaction-diffusion dynamical model should comply in order to exhibit a Turing instability. The main conclusion limits the existence of this instability to nonlinearity degrees larger or equal to three.

## 10. Manifolds of exceptional points and effective Zeno limit of an open   two-qubit system

**Authors:** Vladislav Popkov, Carlo Presilla, Mario Salerno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13674v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the exceptional points of a Liouvillian super-operator describing an open quantum system of two interacting qubits. Our focus is the structure of the exceptional point manifolds in the parameter space. In particular, we characterize the manifold of bifurcation points corresponding to largest dissipation. We describe the relative effective quantum Zeno dynamics in the b ifurcation-free regime, which may occur at relatively small dissipation, as well as in the non-bifurcated regime.

## 11. Kinetically constrained models

**Authors:** Ivailo Hartarsky, Cristina Toninelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13634v1)

**Summary:**

The goal of this book is to provide an introduction to the mathematical theory of Kinetically constrained models developed in the last twenty years. The book is intended for both mathematicians and physicists. It is written in the style of a book of the same name, but with a focus on the Kinetically Constrained Model. The goal of the book is for both physicists and mathematicians to understand the theory of the Kinetic Constraints. It was published by Oxford University Press in 1998 and is available in hardback.

## 12. From bosonic canonical ensembles to non-linear Gibbs measures

**Authors:** van Duong Dinh, Nicolas Rougerie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13597v1)

**Summary:**

We study the mean-field limit of the 1D bosonic canonical ensemble in a superharmonic trap. We prove that the limit model is a classical field theory based on a non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger-Gibbs measure conditioned on the L2 mass. We take advantage of this set-up with fixed mass to include focusing/attractive interactions/non-linearities in our study. The study was published in the Journal of Theoretical Physics.

## 13. Spectrum and Lifshitz tails for the Anderson model on the Sierpinski   gasket graph

**Authors:** Laura Shou, Wei Wang, Shiwen Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13583v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study the Anderson model on the Sierpinski gasket graph. We first identify the almost sure spectrum of the Anderson models. We then prove the existence of the integrated density states of the model. We also show that it has Lifshitz tails with an exponent determined by the ratio of the volume growth rate and the random walk dimension of the Siersiksi graph. The results are published in the open-access issue of the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 14. Higher rank elliptic partition functions and multisymmetric elliptic   functions

**Authors:** Allan John Gerrard, Kohei Motegi, Kazumitsu Sakai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13561v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce and investigate a class of partition functions which is an extension of the one introduced by Foda-Manabe. The resulting multisymmetric functions can be regarded as extensions of the rational, trigonometric and elliptic weight functions. We characterize the partition functions by a nested version of Izergin-Korepin analysis, and determine the explicit forms, for each of the Rational, Trigonometric and Elliptic versions.

## 15. Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators

**Authors:** Habib Ammari, Jinghao Cao, Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, Liora Rueff

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13545v1)

**Summary:**

This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonator is small. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of integro-differential equations. We introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation. The paper is published in the Journal of Applied Physics.

## 16. A simple way to reduce the number of contours in the multi-fold   Mellin-Barnes integrals

**Authors:** Mauricio Diaz, Ivan Gonzalez, Igor Kondrashuk, Eduardo A. Notte-Cuello

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13512v1)

**Summary:**

Mellin-Barnes integral representation of one-loop off-shell box massless diagram is five-fold by construction. It is known from the year 1992 that it may be reduced to certain two-fold MB integral. We propose a way to reduce the number of the MB integration contours from five to two by using the MB integral representation only in combination with basic methods of mathematical analysis. We do not use any Barnes lemma to prove the reduction but we use the integral Cauchy formula instead.

## 17. Strings from Feynman Diagrams

**Authors:** Rajesh Gopakumar, Rishabh Kaushik, Shota Komatsu, Edward A. Mazenc, Debmalya Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13397v1)

**Summary:**

The Feynman diagrams correspond to discrete lattice points on string moduli space, rather than discretized worldsheets. This picture is valid to all orders in the $1/N$ expansion. The embedding of these Kontsevich-like duals into the 1/2 SUSY sector of AdS/CFT is achieved by open strings on giant graviton branes. The concrete mechanism for how strings emerge from the matrix model predicts that multiple open string descriptions can exist for the same dual closed string theory.

## 18. Gap Labels and Asymptotic Gap Opening for Full Shifts

**Authors:** David Damanik, Íris Emilsdóttir, Jake Fillman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13391v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13391v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss gap labelling for operators generated by the full shift over a compact subset of the real line. The set of Johnson--Schwartzman gap labels is the algebra generated by weights of clopen subsets of the support of the single-site distribution. Due to the presence of a dense set of periodic orbits, it is impossible to find a sampling function for which all gaps allowed by the gaplabelling theorem open simultaneously. Nevertheless, for a suitable choice of theSingleSite distribution, we show that for generic sampling functions, every spectral gap opens in the large-coupling limit.
