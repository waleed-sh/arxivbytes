## 0. Stochastic Calculus and Hochschild Homology

**Authors:** Si Li, Zichang Wang, Peng Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12360v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12360v1)

**Summary:**

This paper is a case study of probabilistic approach to topological quantum field theory. We propose that the topological correlations are realized in the large variance limit. An investigation on the relation between Probabilistic topological correlation on the circle and Hochschild homology is illustrated. The paper is published in the online edition of the Journal of Quantum Theory and Mechanics.

## 1. The algebraic structure of Dyson--Schwinger equations with multiple   insertion places

**Authors:** Nicholas Olson-Harris, Karen Yeats

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12350v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12350v1)

**Summary:**

We give combinatorially controlled series solutions to Dyson--Schwinger equations with multiple insertion places using tubings of rooted trees. We then investigate the algebraic relation between such solutions and the renormalization group equation. We conclude with an analysis of the relation between the series and the group equation in the form of a series of root-to-root relation. The results are published in the book "Dyson-- Schwinger Equations: A Combinatorially Controlled Series Solution"

## 2. The Kirkwood-Dirac representation associated to the Fourier transform   for finite abelian groups: positivity

**Authors:** Stephan De Bièvre, Christopher Langrenez, Danylo Radchenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12252v1)

**Summary:**

We construct and study the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) representations naturally associated to the Fourier transform of finite abelian groups $G$. We identify all pure KD-positive states and all KD-real observables for these KD representations. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that all KD representations are convex combinations of pure KD positive states. We prove that for $G=\Z_{d}$, with $d$ a prime power, this condition is satisfied.

## 3. A quadratic BSDE approach to normalization for the finite volume 2D   sine-Gordon model in the finite ultraviolet regime

**Authors:** Shanjian Tang, Rundong Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12172v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12172v1)

**Summary:**

This paper is devoted to a new construction of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon model on bounded domains by a novel normalization technique in the finite ultraviolet regime. Our methodology involves a family of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs for short) driven by a cylindrical Wiener process. The terminal conditions of the quadratic BSDEs are uniformly bounded and converge in probability to the real part of imaginary multiplicative chaos tested against an arbitrarily given test function. Our approach can also be used effectively to establish the connection between our sines-Gordon measure and the scaling limit of correlation functions of the critical planar XOR-Ising model.

## 4. Lower bounds on concentration through Borel transforms and quantitative   singularity of spectral measures near the arithmetic transition

**Authors:** Svetlana Jitomirskaya, Wencai Liu, Serguei Tcheremchantsev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12153v1)

**Summary:**

We develop tools to study arithmetically induced singular continuous spectrum in the neighborhood of the arithmetic transition in the hyperbolic regime. This leads to first transition-capturing upper bounds on packing and multifractal dimensions of spectral measures. We achieve it through the proof of partial localization of generalized eigenfunctions, another first result of its kind in the singular continuous regime. The proof is based also on a general criterion for lower bounds on concentrations of Borel measures that may be of wider use and independent interest.

## 5. The density conjecture for Juddian points for the quantum Rabi model

**Authors:** Rishi Kumar, Zeév Rudnick

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12105v1)

**Summary:**

We study doubly degenerate (Juddian) eigenvalues for the Quantum Rabi Hamiltonian. We prove a strong form of the density conjecture of Kimoto, Reyes-Bustos, and Wakayama. The fine structure of the zeros of classical Laguerre polynomials plays a key role in our methods. We also construct infinitely many sets of parameters for which the Rabi. Hamiltonian admits two distinct Juddian eigen values. We conclude that there is a dense set of coupling strengths for the corresponding RabiHamiltonian.

## 6. Lusztig sheaves, characteristic cycles and the Borel-Moore homology of   Nakajima's quiver varieties

**Authors:** Jiepeng Fang, Yixin Lan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12047v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12047v1)

**Summary:**

We build a morphism from the canonical bases of integrable highest weight modules of quantum groups to the top Borel-Moore homology groups of Nakajima's quiver and tensor product varieties. As an application, we show that Nakjima's realization of irreducible highest weight. modules and their tensor products can be defined over integers. We also prove Nakijima's conjecture on the canonical isomorphism of tensor. product varieties, and compare the canonical. bases and the fundamental classes.

## 7. Matched pairs and Yang-Baxter operators

**Authors:** Yunnan Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11975v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11975v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we provide equivalence conditions for such kind of Yang-Baxter operators to be involutive. We give a positive answer for an open problem raised by Ferri and Sciandra. We use a simplified characterization to classify matched pairs of actions on the 8-dimensional non-semisimple Hopf algebra $A_{C_2\times C_2}$ and analyze the associatedYang-B Baxter operators to find that they are all involutive, too.

## 8. Trace-free Einstein gravity as two interacting constrained $BF$ theories

**Authors:** Merced Montesinos, Diego Gonzalez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948v1)

**Summary:**

A theory of gravity alternative to general relativity is trace-free Einstein gravity. It has the remarkable property that the cosmological constant emerges as an integration constant. The new actions have the advantage of not involving any nondynamical fields or unimodular condition, and their only gravitational sector istrace-freeinstein gravity. They describe the theory as two $BF$ theories supplemented with some constraints. The first action comprises two copies of the constrained $ BF$ theory for the Husain-Kucha model. The second action employs two copies. of the chiral Plebanski action for general relativity plus an additional constraint.

## 9. Trace-free Einstein gravity as a constrained bigravity theory

**Authors:** Merced Montesinos, Diego Gonzalez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11939v1)

**Summary:**

Trace-free Einstein gravity is a prominent alternative to general relativity. In the first version, the cosmological constant arises as an integration constant. We report two diffeomorphism-invariant actions in which the energy-momentum conservation emerges directly from the equations of motion. To achieve this, auxiliary fields but otherwise dynamical are introduced in the corresponding actions, which have the form a constrained bigravity theory. These results constitute a significant advance in our understanding of trace- free Einstein gravity.
