## 0. Random matrix ensembles and integrable differential identities

**Authors:** Costanza Benassi, Marta Dell'Atti, Antonio Moro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11296v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11296v1)

**Summary:**

We develop the approach for the unitary and orthogonal ensembles. We focus on a reduction where the probability measure is induced by a Hamiltonian. The thermodynamic limit leads to an integrable system of hydrodynamic type. Intriguingly, we find that the solution to the initial value problem for both the discrete system and its continuum limit are given by the very same semi-discrete dynamical chain. We show that the order parameters solve the modified KP equation.

## 1. $QQ$-systems and tropical geometry

**Authors:** Rahul Singh, Anton M. Zeitlin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11260v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the system of polynomial equations, known as $QQ$-systems. They are closely related to the so-called Bethe ansatz equations of the XXZ spin chain. We use the methods of tropical geometry to solve the equations. The results are published in the open-access journal, Theoretical and Applied Physics.

## 2. Characterizing High Schmidt Number Witnesses in Arbitrary Dimensions   System

**Authors:** Liang Xiong, Nung-sing Sze

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11213v1)

**Summary:**

A profound comprehension of quantum entanglement is crucial for the progression of quantum technologies. The degree of entanglements can be assessed by enumerating the entangled degrees of freedom, leading to the determination of a parameter known as the Schmidt number. In this paper, we develop an efficient analytical tool for characterizing high Schmidt number witnesses for bipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. Our methods not only offer viable mathematical methods for constructing high-dimensional Schmidt number witness in theory but also simplify the quantification of entangling and dimensionality.

## 3. Magnetic uniform resolvent estimates

**Authors:** Piero D'Ancona, Zhiqing Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11151v1)

**Summary:**

We establish uniform $L^{p}-L^{q}$ resolvent estimates for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators in dimension $n \geq 3$ Under suitable decay conditions on the electromagnetic potentials, we prove that for all $z$ with $|\Im z| \leq 1$ the resolent satisfies. This extends previous results by providing estimates valid for all frequencies with explicit dependence on $z. We also derive a variant with less stringent decay assumptions when restricted to a smaller parameter range.

## 4. A fully variational numerical method for structural topology   optimization based on a Cahn-Hilliard model

**Authors:** Edmund Bell-Navas, David Portillo, Ignacio Romero

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11096v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate a novel numerical method suitable for the solution of topology optimization problems in solid mechanics. The most salient feature of the new approach is that the space and time discrete equations of the numerical method can be obtained as the optimality conditions of a single incremental potential. We propose a change of variables in the model equations that constrains the value of the density within admissible bounds and a continuation strategy that speeds up the evolution of the flow. The proposed strategy results in a robust and efficient topology optimized method that is exactly mass-preserving.

## 5. Phase-space quantum distorted stability pattern for Aubry-André-Harper   dynamics

**Authors:** Alex E. Bernardini, Orfeu Bertolami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11036v1)

**Summary:**

Instability features associated to topological quantum domains are investigated. Hyperbolic equilibrium and stability patterns are identified and classified according to the associated (nonlinear) AAH Hamiltonian parameters. The Wigner flow patterns here discussed suggest a systematic procedure for identifying the role of quantum fluctuations over equilibrium and Stability. The framework can be straightforwardly extended to describe the evolution of similar/modified AAH systems. It is hoped that this article will provide a framework for quantifying the information content of AAH system.

## 6. Analytical coordinate time at the second post-Newtonian order

**Authors:** Vittorio De Falco, Marco Gallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029v1)

**Summary:**

We derive the analytical expression of the coordinate time $t$ in terms of the eccentric anomaly $u$ at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. This effort reveals to be extremely useful for application purposes. We need to truncate the aforementioned sum to a certain finite threshold, which strongly depends on the selected parameter values and the accuracy error we would like to achieve. Thanks to our work, this analysis can be easily carried out.

## 7. Ornstein-Zernike decay of Wilson line observables in the free phase of   the \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) lattice Higgs model

**Authors:** Malin Palö Forsström

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10909v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10909v1)

**Summary:**

In the physics literature, the Wilson line observable is believed to have a phase transition between a region with pure exponential decay and one with Ornstein-Zernike type corrections. In this paper, we complement these results by showing that if the size of the line is small, then Wilson line expectations have exponential decay. We show that this is the case if the line length is small and if the length is large compared to the line's length. In~\cite{f2024b}, we confirmed the first part of this prediction.
