## 0. Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond   Horndeski Gravity

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155v1)

**Summary:**

We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity. We argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. We discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities. Back to the page you came from.

## 1. Flexible Foil Mesh Generation for Spatial Focal-Body Modeling of a   Spherical Mirror

**Authors:** Netzer Moriya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19092v1)

**Summary:**

The study addresses the challenge of accurately representing highly concave structures formed by the focusing effect. We present a novel application of the Flexible Foil Mesh Generation (FFMG) method to model the $3D$ Focal Body generated by a spherical mirror collecting light from an infinitely distant source on its optical axis. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the FFMG method in capturing the intricate geometry of the F focal body. The study has implications for computational geometry, $3d$ reconstruction, and optical system modeling.

## 2. Thermodynamics of Hamiltonian anyons with applications to quantum heat   engines

**Authors:** Joe Dunlop, √Ålvaro Tejero, Michalis Skotiniotis, Daniel Manzano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19019v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19019v1)

**Summary:**

Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently.

## 3. Existence of global solutions to the massive Thirring model in the   non-laboratory coordinates

**Authors:** Sucai Niu, Junyi Zhu, Xueru Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18930v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18930v1)

**Summary:**

Existence of global solutions is shown for the cases of the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem without eigenvalues or resonances. The Lipschitz continuity of the map from the scattering data to the potential $v(x)$ is shown. Two transform matrices are introduced to curb the convergence of the Volterra integral equations and the relevant estimates of the modified Jost functions. The reconstructions for potential $u(x,t)$ and $v (x, t)$ are finished by considering the time dependence of the scatteringData and by constructing the conservation laws.

## 4. Calogero-Sutherland-type quantum systems, generalized hypergeometric   functions and superintegrability for integral chain

**Authors:** Fan Liu, Rui Wang, Jie Yang, Wei-Zhong Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18921v1)

**Summary:**

We reinvestigate the Calogero-Sutherland-type (CS-type) models and generalized hypergeometric functions. We construct the generalized CS operators for circular, Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel cases and establish the generalized Lasselle-Nekrasov correspondence. We analyze the superintegrability for the $\beta$-deformed integrals, where the measures are associated with the corresponding ground state wave functions of CS models. We present their $O$-representations in terms of the $\hat O$- operator.

## 5. A notion of fractality for a class of states and noncommutative relative   distance zeta functional

**Authors:** Yat Tin Chow

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18896v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [5] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures. We then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for thisclass of states. We also explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zetafunctional and propose functional equations similar to [2].

## 6. Cohomological Field Theory with vacuum and its Virasoro constraints

**Authors:** Shuai Guo, Qingsheng Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18895v1)

**Summary:**

This is the first part of a series of papers on Virasoro constraints for Cohomological Field Theory (CohFT) For a CohFT with vacuum, we introduce the concepts of $S$-calibration and $nu$-Calibration. Then, we define the (formal) total descendent potential corresponding to a given calibration. Finally, weIntroduce an additional structure, namely homogeneity, for both the CohFT and the calibrations. We prove the full conjectures for semisimple CohFTs.   As applications, our results yield the Virasori constraints for the deformed negative $r$-spin theory.

## 7. Twisting $\mathcal{O}$-operators by $(2,3)$-Cocycle of Hom-Lie-Yamaguti   Algebras with Representations

**Authors:** Sami Mabrouk, Sergei Silvestrov, Fatma Zouaidi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18804v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we first introduce the notion of twisted $\mathcal O$-operators on a Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebra by a given $(2,3)$-cocycle with coefficients in a representation. Then, we define a cohomology of twisted $O$-operated algebras on the same algebra. Finally, we study the underlying structure of the twisted O$ operator on the Hom-NS-Lie and NS-Lie algebraes.
