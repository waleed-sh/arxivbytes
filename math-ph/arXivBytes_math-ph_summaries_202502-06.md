## 0. Fragile topology on solid grounds and the Thouless conjecture

**Authors:** Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442v1)

**Summary:**

This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \le 3$, vanishing Chern classes characterize the topological phases of periodic media that exhibit localized Wannier functions. For special symmetries $I$ of the system, such as $C_{2z}T$ (space-time reversal), the existence of a localized set of Wanniers may not always exist. Nevertheless, this obstruction can be lifted by adding Chern-trivial line bundles, invariant under the $I-symmetry.

## 1. Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative   Einstein-Maxwell equation

**Authors:** Filip Požar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the Drinfeld twist. We solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the nonCommutative parameter $a$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole. The electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr- newman potential. We introduce a nonzero term proportional to $a$ in the electromagnetic potential.

## 2. Hidden $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-symmetry in $BC_l^{(2)}$

**Authors:** K. Iohara, Y. Saito

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03316v1)

**Summary:**

A well-known action on the characters of integrable highest weight modules over the affine Lie algebra is extended to an even action by supplementing their twisted characters. For example, the action of a Lie algebra of type \(BC_l^{(2)\) at a positive level can be extended to a positive even action at a negative level. For other Lie algebras, see the section on Lie Algebrases on the Wikipedia page "Lie Algebra" for more details.

## 3. Pseudo-Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems and Kähler Duality of Complex   Coadjoint Orbits

**Authors:** Luiz Frederic Wagner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03310v1)

**Summary:**

This thesis is split up into two parts: The first one concerns (pseudo)-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems, while the second part is about K\"ahler structures of complex coadjoint orbits. We show that PHHSs satisfy almost the same properties as HHSs. We suspect that the K\'ahler duality can be traced back to double cotangent bundles. A holomorphic K\'Ahler structure can be thought of as a complexification of a usual K\'AHler structure.

## 4. High-precision numerical evaluation of Lauricella functions

**Authors:** M. A. Bezuglov, B. A. Kniehl, A. I. Onishchenko, O. L. Veretin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03276v1)

**Summary:**

We present a method for high-precision numerical evaluations of Lauricella functions, whose indices are linearly dependent on some parameter. This method is based on finding analytic continuations of these functions in terms of Frobenius generalized power series. The method has been implemented in the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package, written in Wolfram Mathematica language. To accelerate the calculation procedure further, the dependence of the result is reconstructed from the evaluations of given LaurICElla functions at specific numerical values of $\varepsilon.

## 5. Diffraction of the Hat and Spectre tilings and some of their relatives

**Authors:** Michael Baake, Franz Gähler, Jan Mazáč, Andrew Mitchell

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03268v1)

**Summary:**

The diffraction spectra of the Hat and Spectre monotile tilings are derived and computed explicitly. This is done via model set representatives of self-similar members in the topological conjugacy classes. Since the windows of the underlying model sets have fractal boundaries, these coefficients need to be computed via an exact renormalisation cocycle in internal space. The Fourier--Bohr coefficients are also calculated explicitly. The results are published in a paper entitled The Diffraction Spectra of Monotile Tiles.

## 6. Phase space analysis of CCDM cosmologies

**Authors:** Sudip Halder, Jaume de Haro, Supriya Pan, Tapan Saha, Subenoy Chakraborty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03256v1)

**Summary:**

We perform a detailed investigation of the CCDM (creation of cold dark matter) cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict unstable dark matter dominated critical points, stable accelerating attractors dominated by dark matter or the second fluid, and scaling attractors in which both dark matter and second fluid co-exist. These scenarios also indicate the possibility of decelerating attractors or decelerated scaling attractor in the future.

## 7. Global critical points of the Standard Model on four-dimensional   spacetimes of expanding type

**Authors:** Volker Branding, Marko Sobak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03240v1)

**Summary:**

The Standard Model of elementary particle physics is one of the most successful models of contemporary theoretical physics being in full agreement with experiments. However, its mathematical structure deserves further investigations both from a geometric and an analytic point of view. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a mathematically well-defined and self-contained description of the Standard Model in terms of gauge theory and differential geometry on globally hyperbolic manifolds. Within this setup we then prove the existence of a global solution for the Euler-Lagrange equations.

## 8. Existence and stability of soliton-based frequency combs in the   Lugiato-Lefever equation

**Authors:** Lukas Bengel, Björn de Rijk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03189v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03189v1)

**Summary:**

Kerr frequency combs are optical signals consisting of a multitude of equally spaced excited modes in frequency space. They are generated by converting a continuous-wave pump laser within an optical microresonator. The discovery has unlocked a wide range of promising applications, particularly in optical communications, spectroscopy and frequency metrology, say the authors of a new paper in the journal Optics & Laser Research (O&L), which is published by the University of California, San Diego.

## 9. On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock   theta functions, and false theta functions, II

**Authors:** Nikolay Borozenets, Eric T. Mortenson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03074v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03074v1)

**Summary:**

Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations in order to classify all representations of the Kac-Moody algebras with characters being modular forms. We calculate the Zagier-Zwegers' polar-finite decomposition for admissible characters with string functions being mock modular coefficients of the finite part. These admissible string functions were realized by Ahn, Chung, and Tye as the characters of the generalized Fateev-Zamolodchikov parafermionic theories.

## 10. Fractal curvatures and short-time asymptotics of heat content

**Authors:** Anna Rozanova-Pierrat, Alexander Teplyaev, Steffen Winter, Martina Zähle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02989v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02989v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we present applied mathematics results on the heat content of bounded domains with smooth boundary and with fractal boundary. Second, we discuss new findings and concepts related to fractal curvatures for domains with fracta boundary. We conjecture that fractal. curvatures and their scaling exponents will emerge in the short-time heat content asymptotics of domains with. fractal boundaries. The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics.

## 11. Three topological phases of the elliptic Ginibre ensembles with a point   charge

**Authors:** Sung-Soo Byun, Eui Yoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02948v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the complex and symplectic elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $c+1)N. We show that their limiting spectrum is either simply connected, doubly connected, or composed of two disjoint simply connected components. We provide an explicit description of the limiting spectrum and the corresponding electrostatic energies. As an application, we derive the asymptotic behaviour of the moments of the characteristic polynomial in the exponentially varying regime of the matrices. We also show the regions in the parameter space $ (p, c, $ where each topological type emerges.

## 12. On the Boson-Fermion Correspondence for Factorial Schur Functions

**Authors:** Daniel Bump, Andrew Hardt, Travis Scrimshaw

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02841v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02841v1)

**Summary:**

We give an algebraic (non-analytic) proof of the deformed boson-fermion Fock space construction of Molev's double supersymmetric Schur functions. In other words, we make no assumptions on the variables and parameters. By specializing to a finite number of variables and shifting parameters, we recover the factorial Schur function. Furthermore, we realize the bosonic construction through a representation of a completion of the infinite rank general linear Lie algebra. We conclude by saying that the construction can be deduced from this.

## 13. Can one hear the shape of a crystal?

**Authors:** Haina Wang, Salvatore Torquato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02819v1)

**Summary:**

Isospectrality is a general fundamental concept often involving whether various operators can have identical spectra, i.e., the same set of eigenvalues. We use rigorous methods as well as a precise numerical algorithm that enables us to determine the minimum multi-particle basis of inequivalent isospectrals. Based on our analyses, we conjecture that $n_{\text{min}}(d) = 4, 3, 2$ for $d = 1, 2, 3$, respectively.
