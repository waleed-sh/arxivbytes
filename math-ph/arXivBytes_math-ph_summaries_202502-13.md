## 0. Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated   single band for matrix models

**Authors:** Hanwen Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641v1)

**Summary:**

We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized W Annier functions directly from parallel transport. We prove that the corresponding Wanniers are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalization.. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.

## 1. Interacting Particle Systems Modeling Self-Propelled Motions

**Authors:** Saori Morimoto, Makoto Katori, Hiraku Nishimori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08543v1)

**Summary:**

In non-equilibrium statistical physics, active matters in both living and non-living systems have been extensively studied. In particular, self-propelled particle systems provide challenging research subjects in experimental and theoretical physics. A typical example of man-made self- propelled systems which can be easily handled in small-sized experiments is a system of camphor floats put on the surface of water. Based on the experimental and. theoretical studied by Nishimori et. al. (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 86 (2017) 101012), we propose a new type of mathematical models for complex motions of. camphor disks.

## 2. All Hilbert spaces are the same: consequences for generalized   coordinates and momenta

**Authors:** S. J. van Enk, D. A. Steck

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08494v1)

**Summary:**

There are just six basic ways to define generalized coordinate operators in Quantum Mechanics. In each case a canonically conjugate generalized momentum operator can be defined, but it may not be self-adjoint. A special role is reserved for measurements that simultaneously measure both. We also show why there are more ways of defining basic coordinate and momentum measurements. We show that all separable complex Hilbert spaces of a given dimension are isomorphic to each other. We conclude that there are seven basic pairs of coordinate and Momentum operators.

## 3. Stability of N-front and N-back solutions in the Barkley model

**Authors:** Christian Kuehn, Pascal Sedlmeier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08349v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we establish for an intermediate Reynolds number domain the stability of N-front and N-back solutions for each N > 1 corresponding to traveling waves. We base our work on the existence analysis of a heteroclinic loop between a turbulent and a laminar equilibrium proved by Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk. The stability proof follows the verification of a set of abstract stability hypotheses stated by Sandstede in SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis 29.1 (1998), pp. 183-207.

## 4. Generalized synchronization in the presence of dynamical noise and its   detection via recurrent neural networks

**Authors:** José M. Amigó, Roberto Dale, Juan C. King, Klaus Lehnertz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08343v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08343v1)

**Summary:**

In nonlinear times series analysis, the existence of the synchronization map amounts to the invertibility of the so-called cross map. Noise will be modeled using a family of driving dynamics indexed by a finite number of parameters, which is sufficiently general for practical purposes. To reveal generalized synchronization in both the noiseless and noisy scenarios, we check theexistence of synchronization maps of higher periods (introduced in this paper) using recurrent neural networks and predictability. The results obtained with synthetic and real world data demonstrate the capability of our method.

## 5. Moment estimates for polyatomic Boltzmann equation with frozen   collisions

**Authors:** Ricardo Alonso, Milana Čolić

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08237v1)

**Summary:**

A polyatomic gas with continuous internal energy is considered, allowing for frozen collisions. A priori moment estimates are derived for solutions of the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation with a collision kernel of the hard potentials type with cut-off. The moment generation property is shown to be driven by the rate of the pure polyatomic operator, and the moment propagation property holds, the authors say. The study was published in the Journal of Physics and Astronomy, a division of the University of California, San Diego.

## 6. On a coupled system of KP-type

**Authors:** Jacob B. Aguilar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08135v1)

**Summary:**

In 2007, it was shown that the zero-mass (in $x$) constraint is satisfied at any non-zero time even if it is not satisfied at initial time zero. In this article, we introduce a new modified KP system. After providing a variational derivation of the model, we analyze its Hamiltonian evolutionary structure. We prove linear estimates in the Bourgain spaces $X^{s,b}$ corresponding to the integral equation arising from the Duhamel formulation of system.

## 7. Higher-order continuum models for twisted bilayer graphene

**Authors:** Solomon Quinn, Tianyu Kong, Mitchell Luskin, Alexander B. Watson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08120v1)

**Summary:**

The first-order continuum PDE model proposed by Bistritzer and MacDonald accurately describes the single-particle electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at small twist angles. We obtain higher-order corrections to the model via a systematic multiple-scales expansion. Numerical simulations of tight-binding and continuum dynamics demonstrate the validity of the higher- order continuum model. Symmetries of theHigher-order models are also discussed. This work extends the analysis from the (first-order) BM model.
