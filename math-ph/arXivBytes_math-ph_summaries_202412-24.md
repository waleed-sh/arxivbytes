## 0. Variational Quantum Simulation of Anyonic Chains

**Authors:** Ananda Roy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17781v1)

**Summary:**

Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field theories in two space-time dimensions. They play a central role in the investigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and numerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a quantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains which can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester. The scheme is benchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$ family.

## 1. Critical level set percolation for the GFF in $d>6$: comparison   principles and some consequences

**Authors:** Shirshendu Ganguly, Kaihao Jing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17768v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17768v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study the intrinsic geometry of the critical percolation cluster induced by the level set of the metric Gaussian free field above the critical dimension of six. We establish, for all $d>6,$ the chemical one-arm exponent, as well as an averaged version of a conjecture from (Werner, 2021) which asserts that deletion of loops with diameter larger than $r^{6/d}$ do not affect the connection probabilities between points at Euclidean distance $r.$

## 2. A vanishing theorem in $K$-theory for spectral projections of a   non-periodic magnetic Schrödinger operator

**Authors:** Yuri A. Kordyukov, Vladimir M. Manuilov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17746v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the Schr\"odinger operator $H(\mu)$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$ of bounded geometry. We assume that, for some $E_0>0$, each connected component of the sublevel set $V$ is relatively compact. Under some assumptions on geometric and spectral properties of the connected components, we show that the spectrum of $H('mu')$ in the interval $[0,E_ 0\mu]$ has a gap. The spectral projection of the operator belongs to the Roe $C^*$-algebra $C*(M)$ of the manifold.

## 3. On the Hopf superalgebra of symmetric functions in superspace

**Authors:** Masamune Hattori, Renta Yagi, Shintarou Yanagida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17670v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17670v1)

**Summary:**

The Hopf superalgebra of quasi-symmetric (resp. symmetric) functions in superspace (Fishel-Lapointe-Pinto, 2019) is a terminal object in the category of all combinatorial Hopf algebras. We also introduce a superspace analogue of chromatic symmetric functions of graphs (Stanley, 1995) using the chromatic Hopfsuperal algebra of two-colored graphs. We show that the Hopf superalgebra of quasi-Symmetric functions in superspace is a terminal object in the category of all cocommutative Hopf algebraes.

## 4. Large scale regularity and correlation length for almost   length-minimizing random curves in the plane

**Authors:** Tobias Ried, Christian Wagner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17625v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17625v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a model of random curves in the plane related to the large-scale behavior of the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) at temperature zero in two space dimensions. The random fields we consider behave like white noise on large scales with an ultra-violet regularization reminiscent of the lattice structure of the RFIM. We give a finer description of the minimizer below the length scale starting from which the influence of boundary conditions is suppressed with a given probability. More precisely, we prove flatness of the phase boundaries on scales up to order.

## 5. Closed-string amplitude recursions from the Deligne associator

**Authors:** Konstantin Baune, Johannes Broedel, Federico Zerbini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17579v1)

**Summary:**

Close-string analogues of Selberg integrals satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for a suitable matrix representation of the free Lie algebra on two generators. Limits at z=1 and z=0, which are related by the Deligne associator, with N-point and (N-1)-point closed-string amplitudes, respectively. The results are consistent with earlier results on recursions for open-string tree-level amplitudes.

## 6. $\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz numbers from refined topological recursion

**Authors:** Nitin Kumar Chidambaram, Maciej Dołęga, Kento Osuga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17502v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that single $G$-weighted $\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz numbers with internal faces are computed by refined topological recursion on a rational spectral curve. In particular, our results cover the cases of $G-monotone Hurwitz numbers and the enumeration of maps and bipartite maps (with internal faces) on non-oriented surfaces. As an application, we prove that the correlators of the Gaussian, Jacobi and Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles are computed.

## 7. Abrupt changes in the spectra of the Laplacian with constant complex   magnetic field

**Authors:** David Krejcirik, Tho Nguyen Duc, Nicolas Raymond

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17419v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the spectrum of the Laplace operator, subject to homogeneous complex magnetic fields in the plane. For real magnetic fields, it is well-known that the spectrum consists of isolated eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities (Landau levels) We demonstrate that when the magnetic field has a nonzero imaginary component, the spectrum expands to cover the entire complex plane. We show that the Landau levels (appropriately rotated and now embedded in the complex plane) persists, unless the field is purely imaginary in which case they disappear and the spectrum becomes purely continuous.

## 8. Local Boundary Conditions for Dirac-type operators

**Authors:** Nadine Große, Alejandro Uribe, Hanne van den Bosch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17396v1)

**Summary:**

We consider Dirac-type operators on manifolds with boundary, and set out to determine all local smooth boundary conditions that give rise to (strongly) regular self-adjoint operators. By combining the general theory of boundary value problems for Dirac operators as in [BB12] and pointwise considerations, we can treat transmission boundary conditions. We analyse these conditions and classify them in low dimensions and ranks in dimensions $3$ and $4$. In particular, we classify all local self- adjoint regular boundary conditions forDirac spinors (four spinor components) in dimensions £3 and £4.

## 9. The Hydrodynamic Limit of Neural Networks with Balanced Excitation and   Inhibition

**Authors:** James MacLaurin, Pedro Vilanova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17273v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17273v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of `Balanced Neural Networks' is a very popular explanation for the high degree of variability and stochasticity in the brain's activity. We determine equations for the hydrodynamic limit of a balanced all-to-all network of 2n neurons for asymptotically large n. The neurons are divided into two classes (excitatory and inhibitory) Each excitatory neuron excites every other neuron, and each inhibitory neuron inhibits all of the other neurons. The effect of neuron j on neuron k is dictated by a spiking Poisson Process.

## 10. Super volumes and KdV tau functions

**Authors:** Alexander Alexandrov, Paul Norbury

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17272v1)

**Summary:**

Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of curves are deeply related to the Kontsevich-Witten KdV tau function. They possess a Virasoro symmetry which comes out of recursion relations between the volumes due to Mirzakhani. We prove that by also allowing Ramond punctures, the super Weil-petersson. volumes are related to a generalised BGW Kdv tau. function. This allows us to prove that these new super volumes also satisfy the Stanford-witten recursion.

## 11. Localization for random operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with the long-range   hopping

**Authors:** Yunfeng Shi, Li Wen, Dongfeng Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17262v1)

**Summary:**

The hopping amplitude decays with the inter-particle distance. By employing the multi-scale analysis (MSA) technique, we prove that for large disorder, the random operators have pure point spectrum with localized eigenfunctions whose decay rate is the same as the hopping term. This gives a partial answer to a conjecture of Yeung and Oono [Europe Phys. Lett. 4(9), (1987): 1061-1065]. The results are published in the online version of the paper.

## 12. Local unitarty equivalence and entanglement by Bargmann invariants

**Authors:** Lin Zhang, Bing Xie, Yuanhong Tao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17237v1)

**Summary:**

The study of quantum states frequently examines the connection between non-local effects in quantum mechanics and quantities that remain unchanged under local unitary transformations. Local unitary equivalence holds significant importance in quantum state classification and resource theory. This paper focuses on the fundamental issue of local unitaries for multipartite quantum states within quantum information theory. These Bargmann invariants are related to the trace of density operator products with marginal states and can be measured through a cycle test, an extension of the SWAP test.
