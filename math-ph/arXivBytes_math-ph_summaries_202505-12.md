## 0. Hamiltonian formalism for non-diagonalisable systems of hydrodynamic   type

**Authors:** Paolo Lorenzoni, Sara Perletti, Karoline van Gemst

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06220v1)

**Summary:**

We study the system of first order PDEs for pseudo-Riemannian metrics governing the Hamiltonian formalism for systems of hydrodynamic type. In the diagonal setting the integrability conditions ensure the compatibility of this system and, thanks to a classical theorem of Darboux, the existence of a family of solutions depending on functional parameters. In this paper we study the generalisation of this result to a class of non-diagonalisable systems of Hydrodynamic Type that naturally generalises Tsarev's integrable diagonal systems.

## 1. Inverse Problem for the Schrödinger Equation with Non-self-adjoint   Matrix Potential

**Authors:** Sergei Avdonin, Alexander Mikhaylov, Victor Mikhaylov, Jeff Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06142v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the dynamical system with boundary control for the vector Schr\"odinger equation on the interval with a non-self-adjoint matrix potential. We first provide a method to recover spectral data for an abstract system from dynamic data. We then develop a strategy for solving the inverse problem for the Schr\'odinger equations using this method with other techniques of the Boundary control method. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for the theory of dynamical systems and their dynamics.

## 2. Validating Griffith fracture propagation in the phase-field approach to   fracture: The case of Mode III by means of the trousers test

**Authors:** F. Kamarei, E. Breedlove, O. Lopez-Pamies

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06086v1)

**Summary:**

There is an abundance of results showing that the phase-field approach to fracture in elastic brittle materials -- when properly accounting for material strength -- describes the fracture from large pre-existing cracks. By contrast, results that demonstrate the ability of this approach to describe Griffith fracture are scarce and restricted to Mode I. Aimed at addressing this lacuna, the main objective of this paper is to show that thePhase III fracture describes Mode III fracture propagation in a manner that is indeed consistent with the Griffith energy competition.

## 3. Algebraic Topology Principles behind Topological Quantum Error   Correction

**Authors:** Xiang Zou, Hoi-Kwong Lo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06082v1)

**Summary:**

Topological quantum error correction (TQEC) has attained the most experimental successes by far. We show that TQEC for qubits works for both orientable and non-orientable manifolds. By addressing previously unexplored topological structures, our findings represent a step forward in achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation and communication, the authors say. The work contributes to the advancement of T QEC by proposing a broader class of codes and demonstrating their theoretical and practical potential, they say.

## 4. Omni-Temporal Theory and Simulation of Hydrodynamic Dispersion using   Fourier Transformation

**Authors:** Md Abdul Hamid, Kyle C. Smith

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06063v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06063v1)

**Summary:**

Hydrodynamic dispersion determines extent of solute mixing and apparent diffusive flux in various chemical, geological, and biological systems. Though established dispersion theory captures the transient interplay between diffusion, flow, and reaction rates, a long-time approximation is commonly adopted. Here, we introduce a frequency-based theory to model omni-temporal dispersion through porous media that simultaneously captures fast and slow components of dispersion. This theory produces breakthrough curves for a fast solute pulse between inactive parallel plates that agree with the solute propagation rates.

## 5. Surface Nematic Uniformity

**Authors:** Andrea Pedrini, Epifanio G. Virga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06037v1)

**Summary:**

In a more technical jargon, we determine all possible uniform nematic fields on a smooth surface. We found explicitly all uniform fields for Beltrami's pseudosphere. Since both geodesics and uniformity are preserved under isometries, by a classical theorem of Minding, the solution for the pseudosphere carries over all other admissible surfaces, thus providing a general solution to the problem (at least in principle) The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.

## 6. Limit Theorems for step reinforced random walks with regularly varying   memory

**Authors:** Aritra Majumdar, Krishanu Maulik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05921v1)

**Summary:**

For a generalized step reinforced random walk, starting from the origin, the first step is taken according to the first element of an innovation sequence. In subsequent epochs, it recalls a past epoch with probability proportional to a regularly varying sequence. The random walk suitably scaled converges almost surely to a process, which may not be Gaussian, when the sequence is bounded and the convergence is in distribution to a Gaussian process otherwise. For the subcritical regime, the process is diffusive, while it is superdiffusive otherwise.

## 7. On removing orders from amplitude equations

**Authors:** David Juhasz, Per Kristen Jakobsen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05915v1)

**Summary:**

The method is primarily motivated by the possibility of simplifying amplitude equations. The key feature of our method is the introduction of a new homogeneous function at each order of the perturbation hierarchy. We have shown that there is a limit to how many terms can be removed, as doing so beyond a certain point would reintroduce linear growth. Using our modified RG method, higher accuracy can also be achieved while maintaining the same level of complexity in the amplitude equation. The method has been tested on numerous scalar ODEs and systems of ODE's.

## 8. Madelung Structure of the Dirac Equation

**Authors:** Luca Fabbri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05861v1)

**Summary:**

Dirac equations in polar form can be re-configured into a system of equations. This system is said to have Madelung structure. Conservation laws, second-order equations and multi-valuedness are also discussed. The system is also known as the Dirac-Jacobi system or Dirac Schrödinger system. It is the first of a series of papers on the theory of spinor fields in the form of Dirac equations. The second part of the article discusses the second order equations and their relation to spinor field.

## 9. A note on quantum Hamiltonian reduction and anomalies

**Authors:** Boris M. Elfimov, Alexey A. Sharapov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05779v1)

**Summary:**

Quantization of field-theoretic models with gauge symmetries is often obstructed by quantum anomalies. This paper provides an explicit example of a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system with first-class constraints whose quantization exhibits anomalies. These anomalies arise from the nontrivial topology of the reduced phase space. It is commonly believed that the origin of these anomalies lies in the infinite number of degrees of freedom, which requires completing the model within an appropriate regularization scheme. But this paper shows that the source of the anomalies is not the degree of freedom.
