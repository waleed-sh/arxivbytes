## 0. The Topological form is the Pfaffian form

**Authors:** Paul-Hermann Balduf, Simone Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09558v1)

**Summary:**

In a given graph $G$, Budzik, Gaiotto, Kulp, Wang, Williams, Wu, Yu, and the first author studied a ''topological'' differential form. The form expresses violations of BRST-closedness of a quantum field theory along a single topological direction. We give an explicit combinatorial proof that this form coincides with the ''Pfaffian'' form. We also discuss the equivalence of several properties of these forms, which had been established independently for both contexts in previous work.

## 1. Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system at integer index $k$:   polynomial algebras of integrals

**Authors:** Juan Carlos LÃ³pez Vieyra, Alexander V Turbiner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09502v1)

**Summary:**

An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces.

## 2. One-point large deviations of the directed landscape geodesic

**Authors:** Daniel Spivak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09486v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09486v1)

**Summary:**

The directed landscape is the central object in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. It is shown to be the scaling limit of various models by Dauvergne and Vir\'ag. This paper disproves a conjecture about the rate of the lowest rate metric under which a geodesic between two points passes through a particular point between them. It also puts the question to rest with an answer and a proof. The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics.

## 3. Conditional Stability of the Euler Method on Riemannian Manifolds

**Authors:** Marta Ghirardelli, Brynjulf Owren, Elena Celledoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09434v1)

**Summary:**

Numerical stability results for numerical integrators on Riemannian manifolds. Model case is a geodesic version of the explicit Euler method. The approach is based on a cocoercivity property of the vector field. In general we find that a non-zero curvature will deteriorate the stability region of theGeodesic Euler Method. The step size bounds depend on the distance traveled over a step from the initial point. Numerical examples for spheres and hyperbolic 2-space confirm that the bounds are tight.

## 4. Dynamical Localization and Transport properties of Quantum Walks on the   hexagonal lattice

**Authors:** Andreas Schaefer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09421v1)

**Summary:**

We study coined Random Quantum Walks on the hexagonal lattice. Each lattice site is equipped with an i.i.d. random variable that acts as a random phase in every step of the QW. We show dynamical localization in the regime of strong disorder, that is whenever the coin matrix is sufficiently close to the fully localized case, using a fractional moment criterion and a finite volume method. We adapt a topological index to our model and thereby obtain transport for some coin matrices.

## 5. Smoothness of solutions to the initial-boundary value problem for the   telegraph equation on the half-line with a locally summable potential

**Authors:** Sergey Simonov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09397v1)

**Summary:**

We study solutions to the system $u_{tt}-u_{xx}+q(x)u=0, x>0,t>0$ with a locally summable Hermitian matrix-valued potential $q$ and a $C^{\infty}$-smooth boundary control $g$ vanishing near the origin. We prove that the solution $u^{g}(\cdot,T)$ is a function from $W^2_1([0,T];\mathbb C^n) and that the control operator $W ^T:g\mapsto u^g ($T) is an isomorphism in $L_2($T) and $H

## 6. Weighted Bergman kernels and $\star$-products

**Authors:** Andreas Sykora

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09322v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the weighted Bergman kernel on a complex domain with a weight of the form $rho=e^{-\alpha\phi}\mu g$, where $alpha$ is a positive real number. Several $\star$-products related to the Bergman kernels are determined. Explicit formulas are provided up to first order. We conclude that the kernel can be viewed as a weighted sum of two real-valued positive functions. The kernel can also be seen as a complex sum of real-value positive functions, with the kernel being the product of these.

## 7. Open Hurwitz Flat F manifolds

**Authors:** Guilherme Feitosa de Almeida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09258v1)

**Summary:**

WDVV equations play a crucial role in the structure of Frobenius manifolds, quantum cohomology, and integrable systems. They provide a framework to incorporate boundary conditions, making them fundamental in Open Gromov-Witten theory. Using Dubrovin's construction of Landau Ginzburg superpotentials associated with Hurwitz spaces, we demonstrate that their primitives satisfy Open WDVV equation. Our approach provides an efficient method for computing Open WDvV equations associated with any Hurwitz Dubrovian manifold.

## 8. Energy Conditions and Stability of Charged Wormholes in $f(R,   \mathscr{L}_m)$ Gravity: A Comparative Analysis with Compact Objects

**Authors:** Sagar V. Soni, A. C. Khunt, Farook Rahaman, A. H. Hasmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09222v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the energy conditions of charged traversable wormholes in the framework of modified gravity. Our findings show that the radial NEC remains satisfied across a wide range of charge parameters consistent with established physical laws. For higher charge values, violations occur, indicating the formation of a throat-like structure necessary for wormhole stability. We compare the pressure-density profiles of these charged wormholes with those of compact objects such as neutron stars, revealing distinct variations in matter distribution. This analysis highlights the crucial role of charge and modified gravity in determining the stability and physical characteristics of wormhole structures.
