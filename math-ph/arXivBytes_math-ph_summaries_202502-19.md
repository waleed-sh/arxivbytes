## 0. Discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature through Jack   generating functions

**Authors:** Cesar Cuenca, Maciej Dołęga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13098v1)

**Summary:**

We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants. We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LL n of Huang. We also find the LLn for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero.

## 1. Global Existence and Nonlinear Stability of Finite-Energy Solutions of   the Compressible Euler-Riesz Equations with Large Initial Data of Spherical   Symmetry

**Authors:** José A. Carrillo, Samuel R. Charles, Gui-Qiang G. Chen, Difan Yuan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13094v1)

**Summary:**

The compressible Euler-Riesz equations are fundamental with wide applications in astrophysics, plasma physics, and mathematical biology. We consider both attractive and repulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for dimensions larger than or equal to two. The strong convergence of the vanishing viscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It is observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no concentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit.

## 2. General soliton solutions to the coupled Hirota equation via the   Kadomtsev-Petviashvili reduction

**Authors:** Changyan Shi, Bingyuan Liu, Bao-Feng Feng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13088v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13088v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we are concerned with various soliton solutions to the coupled Hirota equation, as well as to the Sasa-Satsuma equation. The dynamics of first-, second-order solutions are investigated in detail. It is intriguing that, for the SS equation, the bright soliton is also the soliton to the complex mKdV equation while the amplitude and velocity of dark soliton for \(N=1\) are determined by the background plane wave. We also show that the types of bright solitons can be changed due to collision.

## 3. The Canonical Forms of Matrix Product States in Infinite-Dimensional   Hilbert Spaces

**Authors:** Niilo Heikkinen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12934v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12934v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we prove that any element in the tensor product of separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be expressed as a matrix product state (MPS) of possibly infinite bond dimension. The proof is based on the singular value decomposition of compact operators and the connection between tensor products and Hilbert-Schmidt operators via the Schmidt decomposition. As an example, we explicitly construct an MPS representation for certain eigenstates of a chain of three coupled harmonic oscillators.

## 4. Separation of time scales in weakly interacting diffusions

**Authors:** Zachary P. Adams, Maximilian Engel, Rishabh S. Gvalani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12881v1)

**Summary:**

We study metastable behaviour in systems of weakly interacting Brownian particles with localised, attractive potentials which are smooth and globally bounded. numerical evidence suggests that the particles converge on a short time scale to a "droplet state" which is $metastable$, i.e. persists on a much longer time scale than the time scale of convergence. In this article, we provide rigorous evidence and a quantitative characterisation of this separation of time scales. We thus provide a partial answer to a question posed by Carrillo, Craig, and Yao (Aggregation-Diffusion Equations: Dynamics, Asymptotics, and Singular Limits)

## 5. Moderate deviations in first-passage percolation for bounded weights

**Authors:** Wai-Kit Lam, Shuta Nakajima

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12797v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the moderate and large deviations in first-passage percolation (FPP) with bounded weights on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 2. We establish that, if one assumes that the sublinear error term $T(N) - N (N) is of order $N^\chi$, then under some unverified (but widely believed) assumptions, for $a < 1$ the deviation is larger than expected. We also highlight the interplay between fluctuations and the decay rates of large deviations.

## 6. Geometric Flavours of Quantum Field Theory on a Cauchy Hypersurface:   Gaussian Analysis for the Hamiltonian Formalism and Applications to Cosmology

**Authors:** David Martínez-Crespo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760v1)

**Summary:**

This thesis explores Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on curved spacetimes. In particular it studies the theory of the scalar field described through its configurations over a Cauchy hypersurface. It is focused on mathematical consistency based on analytic and geometric tools. The work begins by extending the Koopman-van Hove formalism of classical statistical mechanics to CSFT. It reveals features inherent to both CSFT and QFT, that help delineate the genuine quantum features of a theory.

## 7. Thermal time of noncommutative Minkowski spacetime

**Authors:** Kilian Hersent

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12750v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the thermal time hypothesis of arXiv:gr-qc/9406019 in the context of noncommutative deformations of Minkowski. We show that a natural modular group arises from the modular function of the momentum space. The impact of inner automorphism transformation on the physics and the treatment of unimodular case (unthermalised spacetimes) are discussed. A reflection on the use of thermal field theory for quantum gravity phenomenology is put forward.

## 8. Matrix Product States as Observations of Entangled Hidden Markov Models

**Authors:** Abdessatar Souissi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12641v1)

**Summary:**

This paper reveals the intrinsic structure of Matrix Product States (MPS) by establishing their deep connection to entangled hidden Markov models (EHMMs) It is demonstrated that a significant class of MPS can be derived as the outcomes of EHMMs, showcasing their underlying quantum correlations. A lower bound is derived for the relative entropy between the EHMM-observation process and the corresponding MPS. These results are supported by illustrative examples from quantum information, emphasizing their importance in understanding entanglement, quantum correlations and tensor network representations.
