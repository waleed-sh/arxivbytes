## 0. Low Regularity of Self-Similar Solutions of Two-Dimensional Riemann   problems with Shocks for the Isentropic Euler system

**Authors:** Gui-Qiang G. Chen, Mikhail Feldman, Wei Xiang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07034v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07034v1)

**Summary:**

We are concerned with the low regularity of self-similar solutions of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system. We prove that it is not possible that both the density and the velocity are in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for these problems in general. We establish a general framework for the analysis of the local regularities of such solutions for a class of RiemANN problems. The proof is based on a regularization of the EulerSystem to derive the transport equation for the vorticity.

## 1. Bulk metric reconstruction from entanglement data via minimal surface   area variations

**Authors:** Niko Jokela, Tony Liimatainen, Miika Sarkkinen, Leo Tzou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07016v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07016v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk geometries. By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background. We recover the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do this by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems.

## 2. Exact Current Fluctuations in a Tight-Binding Chain with Dephasing Noise

**Authors:** Taiki Ishiyama, Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06989v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06989v1)

**Summary:**

For a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on an infinite interval, we exactly calculate the variance of the integrated current for a step initial condition with average densities. Our exact solution reveals that the presence of dephased, no matter how small, alters the nature of current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive in the long-time limit. We demonstrate that the asymptotic form of the variance and a numerically obtained cumulant generating function coincide with those in the symmetric simple exclusion process.

## 3. How does the supercritical GMC converge?

**Authors:** Federico Bertacco, Martin Hairer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06956v1)

**Summary:**

The study looked at the local structure of log-correlated Gaussian fields around extremal points. As a consequence, we obtain a refined understanding of the freezing phenomenon in supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos, the authors say. The study was published in the journal Adv Math 330 (2018) and is based on a paper by M. Biskup and O. Louidor. For more information, visit Adv Math. 330 ( 2018) and www.advmath.org.

## 4. The Dirac Equation, Mass and Arithmetic by Permutations of Automaton   States

**Authors:** Hans-Thomas Elze

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06883v1)

**Summary:**

The cornerstones of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics are its underlying ontological states that evolve by permutations. They do not create would-be quantum mechanical superposition states. We review this with a classical automaton consisting of an Ising spin chain which is related to the Weyl equation in the continuum limit. Based on this and generalizing, we construct a new ``Necklace of Necklaces'' automaton with a torus-like topology that lends itself to represent the Dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions.

## 5. Eigenvalues of non-selfadjoint functional difference operators

**Authors:** Alexei Ilyin, Ari Laptev, Lukas Schimmer, Anna Zernova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06858v1)

**Summary:**

Using the well known approach developed in the papers of B. Davies and his co-authors we obtain inequalities for the location of possible complex eigenvalues of non-selfadjoint functional difference operators. When studying the sharpness of the main result we discovered that complex potentials can create resonances. The results are published in the open-access journal, Theoretical and Applied Physics.

## 6. Convergence to the equilibrium for the kinetic transport equation in the   two-dimensional periodic Lorentz Gas

**Authors:** Francesca Pieroni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06839v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the Boltzmann-Grad limit of the two-dimensional periodic Lorentz Gas. We prove that under suitable conditions the time evolution of an initial datum in $L^p$ converges to the equilibrium state. Our proof is based on the analysis of the long time behavior of the Fourier coefficients of the solution. We also get more precise estimates about the rate of the approach to the equilibrium state if $p=2 or $x=0.

## 7. Discrete-to-continuum limit for nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems via   EDP convergence for gradient systems

**Authors:** Georg Heinze, Alexander Mielke, Artur Stephan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06837v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06837v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the convergence of spatial discretizations for reaction-diffusion systems with mass-action law satisfying a detailed balance condition. We construct appropriate space-discrete processes and show convergence not only on the level of solutions, but also on thelevel of the gradient systems governing the evolutions. The convergence is then obtained with variational methods by building on the recently introduced notion of gradient systems in continuity equation format. As an important step, we prove chain rule inequalities for the reaction-Diffusion systems as well as their discretization featuring a non-convex dissipation functional.

## 8. Quantum Field Theory on Multifractal Spacetime: Varying Dimension and   Ultraviolet Completeness

**Authors:** Alessio Maiezza, Juan Carlos Vasquez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06797v1)

**Summary:**

We explore quantum field theory where spacetime exhibits scaling properties and dimensional reduction with changing energy scales. Working within canonical quantization, we demonstrate how to properly quantize fields in such multifractal spacetime. This approach guarantees the finiteness of the theory at all orders in perturbation theory and enables rigorous construction of the S-matrix in the interaction picture. The structure tames dominant, large-order divergence sources in the perturbative series and resolves the Landau pole problem through asymptotic safety.

## 9. Comparison of Frobenius algebra structures on Calabi-Yau toric   hypersurfaces

**Authors:** Jeehoon Park, Philsang Yoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06694v1)

**Summary:**

We establish an isomorphism between two Frobenius algebra structures, termed CY and LG, on the primitive cohomology of a smooth Calabi--Yau hypersurface in a simplicial Gorenstein toric Fano variety. As an application, we observe the existence of a structure on a finite-dimensional subalgebra of the Jacobian algebra of a homogeneous polynomial which may exhibit a non-compact singularity locus. We conclude that the structure is a Frobenii manifold structure.

## 10. On BPS Equations of Generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs Model with   Scalars-Dependent Coupling $θ$-term

**Authors:** Mulyanto, Emir Syahreza Fadhilla, Ardian Nata Atmaja

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06635v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a most general $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model consist of terms up to quadratic in first-derivative of the fields. Using the BPS Lagrangian method we try to find Bogomolnyi's equations for BPS monopoles and dyons. Interestingly we find the value of $\theta$-term's coupling gives additional contribution to electric charge of BPS Dyons, and thus can determine whether we get BPS dyons or monopoles.

## 11. Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation   Theorem and Deep Learning Framework

**Authors:** Yuanfei Huang, Chengyu Liu, Bing Miao, Xiang Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628v1)

**Summary:**

We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Our result holds generally for arbitrary initial conditions, encompassing both steady-state and transient finite-time regimes. Building on the theoretical foundation, we propose a deep learning-based methodology to efficiently compute the entropy production, utilizing the L\'{e}vy score function we proposed. Our results provide a unified framework for analyzing entropy production in active Matter systems while offering practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behaviors.

## 12. One-Dimensional Relativistic Self-Gravitating Systems

**Authors:** Robert B. Mann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06515v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06515v1)

**Summary:**

Much is known about the relativistic gravitational $N$-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the feature of the absence of gravitational radiation. Relativistic self-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further investigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring many-body systems. The three- body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos, and provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relatvistic chaos can be studied. For $N\geq 4$, other interesting features emerge.

## 13. Some Remarks on the Product Formula for Defect Numbers of Closed   Operators

**Authors:** Christoph Fischbacher, Fritz Gesztesy, Lance L. Littlejohn

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06506v1)

**Summary:**

This largely pedagogical paper recalls some facts on defect numbers of products of closed operators. It applies these facts to positive integer powers of symmetric operators and subsequently to certain minimal Sturm--Liouville and minimal higher even-order ordinary and partial differential operators. We also point out some unexpected missed opportunities when comparing the work of different groups on this subject.
