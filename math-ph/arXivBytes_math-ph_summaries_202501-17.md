## 0. Coming full circle -- A unified framework for Kochen-Specker   contextuality

**Authors:** Markus Frembs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09750v1)

**Summary:**

 contextuality is a key distinguishing feature between classical and quantum physics. It expresses a fundamental obstruction to describing quantum theory using classical concepts. When understood as a resource for quantum computation, it is expected to hold the key to quantum advantage. Yet, despite its long recognised importance, the mathematics of contextuality has remained somewhat elusive. We introduce a conceptually new tool called 'context connections' which allows to cast and analyse Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality in new form. We show in detail how this framework subsumes the marginal and graph-theoretic approaches to contextuality and offers a unified perspective on KS contextuality.

## 1. Exact Parent Hamiltonians for All Landau Level States in a Half-flux   Lattice

**Authors:** Xin Shen, Guangyue Ji, Jinjie Zhang, David E. Palomino, Bruno Mera, Tomoki Ozawa, Jie Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09742v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09742v1)

**Summary:**

Realizing topological flat bands with tailored single-particle Hilbert spaces is a critical step toward exploring many-body phases, such as those featuring anyonic excitations. One prominent example is the Kapit-Mueller model, a variant of the Harper-Hofstadter model that stabilizes lattice analogs of the lowest Landau level states. The model points to a large class of tight-binding models with suitable energetic and quantum geometries that are potentially useful for realizing non-Abelian fractionalized states when interactions are included.

## 2. Belavkin-Staszewski Quantum Markov Chains

**Authors:** Andreas Bluhm, Ángela Capel, Pablo Costa Rico, Anna Jenčová

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09708v1)

**Summary:**

It is well-known that the conditional mutual information of a quantum state is zero if, and only if, the state is a quantum Markov chain. We replace the Umegaki relative entropy in the definition of the conditional information by the Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) relative entropy. We call the states with zero BS-conditional mutual information Belavkins Markov chains. This correspondence allows us to find a recovery map for the BS-relative entropy, in the spirit of the Petz recovery map.

## 3. Faber-Krahn inequality for the heat content on quantum graphs via random   walk expansion

**Authors:** Patrizio Bifulco, Matthias Täufer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09693v1)

**Summary:**

We study the heat content on quantum graphs and investigate whether an analogon of the Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality holds. This means that heat content at time $T$ among graphs of equal volume would be maximized by intervals. We prove that this holds at extremal times, that is at small and at large times. In the large time regime, we rely on a spectral-theoretic approach, using Mercer's theorem. The small-time regime is dealt with using the Feynman-Kac formula and Brownian motions on metric graphs.

## 4. Relating the modular Hamiltonian to two-point functions

**Authors:** Markus B. Fröb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09669v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the modular Hamiltonian associated to standard subspaces for a free scalar field in a globally hyperbolic spacetime in an arbitrary Gaussian state. For the restriction of the modular. Hamiltonian to the subspace, we recover formulas that were obtained previously by Casini and. Huerta. We show how the same results can be obtained more directly from the KMS condition. We conclude with the conclusion that the theory can be viewed as a framework for the theory.

## 5. Quantum Contextual Hypergraphs, Operators, Inequalities, and   Applications in Higher Dimensions

**Authors:** Mladen Pavicic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09637v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09637v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum contextuality plays a significant role in supporting quantum computation and quantum information theory. Traditionally, their representation has been predominantly operator-based, mainly focusing on specific constructs in dimensions ranging from three to eight. This study demonstrates how to generate contextual hypergraphs in any dimension using various methods, particularly those that do not scale in complexity with increasing dimensions. Also, we investigate several promising applications of hyper graphs in quantum communication and quantum computation, paving the way for future breakthroughs in the field.

## 6. Optimal paths and dynamical symmetry breaking in the current   fluctuations of driven diffusive media

**Authors:** Pablo I. Hurtado

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09629v1)

**Summary:**

Large deviation theory provides a framework to understand macroscopic fluctuations and collective phenomena in many-body nonequilibrium systems. In these lecture notes we discuss the large deviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a rare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena that appear at the fluctuating level. We also discuss the microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an emerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. We address open challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

## 7. Twistorial chiral algebras in higher dimensions

**Authors:** Tim Adamo, Iustin Surubaru

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09627v1)

**Summary:**

In four spacetime dimensions, the classically integrable self-dual sectors of gauge theory and gravity have associated chiral algebras. These emerge naturally from their description in twistor space. Using twistor sigma models to describe these sectors, we demonstrate that they also arise as soft symmetry algebraes under a certain notion of collinear limit. We show that there are similar chiralAlgebra associated to integrables sectors of gravity and gauge theory in $4m$-dimensions.

## 8. Elucidating the Physical and Mathematical Properties of the   Prouhet-Thue-Morse Sequence in Quantum Computing

**Authors:** Denis Janković, Rémi Pasquier, Jean-Gabriel Hartmann, Paul-Antoine Hervieux

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09610v1)

**Summary:**

This study explores the applications of the Prouhet-Thue-Morse (PTM) sequence in quantum computing. We demonstrate how the PTM sequence naturally appears in Ising X-X interacting systems, leading to a proposed robust encoding of quantum memories in such systems. connections to number theory, including the Riemann zeta function, bridge quantum computing with pure mathematics. Our findings emphasize the P TM sequence's importance in understanding the mathematical structure of quantum computing systems and the development of the full potential of quantum technologies.

## 9. From Weyl Anomaly to Defect Supersymmetric Rényi Entropy and Casimir   Energy

**Authors:** Zi-Xiao Huang, Ma-Ke Yuan, Yang Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09498v1)

**Summary:**

We present a closed-form expression for the contribution of surface defects to the supersymmetric R\'enyi entropy in six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theories. Our results show that this defect contribution is a linear function of $1/n$ and is directly proportional to $2b-d_2$, where $b$ and $ d_2$ are the surface defect Weyl anomaly coefficients. We also derive aclosed-form equation for the defect contribution to the Casimir energy, which simplifies to $-d-2$ in the chiral algebra limit.

## 10. Quantum algorithm for the gradient of a logarithm-determinant

**Authors:** Thomas E. Baker, Jaimie Greasley

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09413v1)

**Summary:**

The logarithm-determinant is a common quantity in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of this quantity compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarathm- determinant. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines.

## 11. Cosmological Solutions in Scalar-Tensor theory via the Eisenhart-Duval   lift

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09356v1)

**Summary:**

We implement the Einsenhart-Duval lift in scalar-tensor gravity as a means to construct integrable cosmological models and analytic solutions. We employ a geometric criterion to constrain the free functions of the theory such that the field equations can be written in the equivalent form of linear equations. This geometric linearization is achieved by the introduction of an extended minisuperspace description. The results are applied to construct analytic solutions in modified theories of gravity such as the $f\left( R\right) $-theory and the hybrid metric-Palatini.

## 12. Pretty-good simulation of all quantum measurements by projective   measurements

**Authors:** Michał Kotowski, Michał Oszmaniec

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09339v1)

**Summary:**

In quantum theory general measurements are described by so-called Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) We show that in $d$-dimensional quantum systems an application of depolarizing noise makes any POVM simulable. This result significantly limits the asymptotic advantage that POVMs can offer over projective measurements in various information-processing tasks. We also apply our findings to questions originating from quantum foundations by improving the range of visibilities for which noisy pure states of two qudits admit a local model.

## 13. Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. II: The General   Mechanism

**Authors:** Kostya Druzhkov, Alexei Cheviakov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09313v1)

**Summary:**

A mechanism of reduction of symmetry-invariant conservation laws, presymplectic structures, and variational principles of partial differential equations (PDEs) is proposed. The mechanism applies for an arbitrary PDE system that admits a local (point, contact, or higher) symmetry. A version of Noether's theorem for the PDESystem satisfied by symmetry-Invariant solutions is presented. Several detailed examples, including cases of point and higher symmetry invariance, are considered. The proposed mechanism is based on the idea that the system can be described by a set of invariant solutions.
