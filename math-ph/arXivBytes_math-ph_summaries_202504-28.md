## 0. Equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on   Finsler geometries

**Authors:** Loïc Marsot, Yuzhang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499v1)

**Summary:**

This article aims to derive equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries. The equations we obtain are the generalization of that of Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) The equations share the same properties as the MPD equations, and we mention different choices possible for supplementary conditions to close this system of equations. These equations have an additional requirement, which is the choice of what defines the tangent direction of the F Insler manifold.

## 1. Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian   Structures

**Authors:** Roee Leder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying Riemannian structure. We extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex.

## 2. On the Excess Charge Problem of Atoms

**Authors:** Dirk Hundertmark, Nikolaos Pattakos, Marvin Raimund Schulz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18487v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18487v1)

**Summary:**

This paper establishes new bounds on the maximum number of electrons $ N_c(Z) $ that an atom with nuclear charge $Z$ can bind. The result improves long--standing bounds by Lieb and Nam obtained in 1984 and 2012. Our bounds show the fundamental difference between fermionic and bosonic atoms for finite $Z. For bosonic atom it is known that t_c = 1.21$ in the limit of large nuclear charges $Z$. We show that this is an explicit bound on the lower order term $O(Z^{1/3})$.

## 3. Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics

**Authors:** Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311v1)

**Summary:**

The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions of the slow modes. In this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT)

## 4. Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval

**Authors:** Guillaume Barraquand, Pierre Le Doussal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18292v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u, v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of theheight.

## 5. Real hyperelliptic solutions of gauged modified KdV equation of genus   $g$

**Authors:** Shigeki Matsutani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18285v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18285v1)

**Summary:**

The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field gives rise to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKv) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hypelliptic curves of genus $g$ by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, Math. Phys. Ana. Geom., 27 (2024) 19).

## 6. A Canonical Construction of the Extended Hilbert Space for Causal   Fermion Systems

**Authors:** Felix Finster, Patrick Fischer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18276v1)

**Summary:**

It is shown that second variations of the causal action can be decomposed into a sum of three terms, two of which being positive and one being small. This gives rise to an approximate decoupling of the linearized field equations into the dynamical wave equation and bosonic field equations. A canonical construction of the extended Hilbert space containing these solutions is given. In addition, it is show that the solution space admits a positive definite inner product which is preserved under the time evolution. It is also shown that this inner product is preserved in time strips.

## 7. Monoidal Quantaloids

**Authors:** Gejza Jenča, Bert Lindenhovius

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18266v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18266v1)

**Summary:**

Dagger compact quantaloids turn out to have properties that are similar to the category Rel of sets and binary relations. For both examples, the process of internalization structures is of interest. We investigate how to internalize power sets and preordered structures in dagger compact quant aloids. We conclude by proposing a symmetric monoidal structure to add a symmetry to the quantaloid structure in a compatible way. The results are published in the open-access issue of the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 8. A generalized fundamental solution technique for the regularized   13-moment system in rarefied gas flows

**Authors:** Himanshi, Lambert Theisen, Anirudh Singh Rana, Manuel Torrilhon, Vinay Kumar Gupta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18261v1)

**Summary:**

The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) for solving the regularized 13-moment (R13) equations for rarefied monatomic gases. The results indicate that the MFS converges faster than the FEM and serves as a promising alternative to conventional meshing-based techniques. The framework is applied to the case of thermally-induced flow between two non-coaxial cylinders. Since no analytical solution exists for this case, we compare the results with those obtained from the finite element method (FEM)

## 9. A Noise-Robust Model-Based Approach to T-Wave Amplitude Measurement and   Alternans Detection

**Authors:** Zuzana Koscova, Amit Shah, Ali Bahrami Rad, Qiao Li, Gari D Clifford, Reza Sameni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18101v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18101v1)

**Summary:**

T-wave alternans (TWA) is a potential marker for sudden cardiac death. But reliable analysis is often constrained to noise-free environments. We explore model-based T-wave estimation to mitigate the impact of noise on TWA level. With EM noise at SNRs of -5 and 5 dB, mean absolute error (MAE) dropped from 62 to 49 uV and 27 to 25 uV, respectively (Mann-Whitney-U test, p < 0.05)
