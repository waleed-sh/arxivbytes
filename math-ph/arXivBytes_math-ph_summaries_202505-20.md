## 0. The localization transition for the directed polymer in a random   environment is smooth

**Authors:** Hubert Lacoin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13382v1)

**Summary:**

When $d\ge 3$ the directed polymer a in a random environment displays a phase transition from a diffusive phase to a localized phase. This transition is encoded by the behavior of the the free energy of the model. We prove that this transition is infinitely smooth in the sense that it grows slower than any power function at the vicinity of $\beta_c$, that is $W^{\beta}_n$ where $N$ is the normalized partition function for a directed polymer of length $n.

## 1. Principal 3-Bundles with Adjusted Connections

**Authors:** Gianni Gagliardo, Christian Saemann, Roberto Tellez-Dominguez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13368v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the notion of adjusted connection for principal 3-bundles. These connections appear in a number of context within high-energy physics. We define a notion of categorified torus that forms an adjusted 2-crossed module, which we hope to be useful in lifting T-duality to M-theory. We list local examples arising in gauged supergravity and a global example arising in various contexts in string/M-Theory. Our primary motivation, however, stems from U-dualism.

## 2. Heterogeneous diffusion in an harmonic potential: the role of the   interpretation

**Authors:** Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Igor M. Sokolov, Ralf Metzler, Diego Krapf

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13363v1)

**Summary:**

Diffusion in heterogeneous energy and diffusivity landscapes is widespread in biological systems. However, solving the Langevin equation in such environments introduces ambiguity due to the interpretation parameter. We analyse the motion of a particle in an harmonic potential -- modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our focus is on two-phase systems with a discontinuity in environmental properties at $x=0$. We derive the probability density of the particle position for the process, and consider two paradigmatic situations.

## 3. Poisson structure on predual of Banach Lie algebroid

**Authors:** Tomasz Goliński, Grzegorz Jakimowicz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13351v1)

**Summary:**

We construct the linear Poisson structure on the predual bundle of a Banach Lie algebroid. It is an alternative approach to the already known results on the linear sub-Poisson structure. We also discuss the existence of queer BanachLie algebroids. An example of a precotangent bundle is presented. We conclude with a discussion of the theory of Banach-Lie Lie Algebroids and its application to the pre-bundle of a Lie bundle.

## 4. Multiple-Order Tensor Field Theory: Enumeration of unitary invariant   observables

**Authors:** Joseph Ben Geloun, Arnauld Solente

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13236v1)

**Summary:**

In Tensor Field Theory (TFT), observables are defined through tensor field contractions. Traditionally, these observables were constructed using tensor fields of a fixed order $d$. Here, we propose an extended theoretical framework for TFT. We then establish a comprehensive group-theoretic formalism that enables the systematic enumeration of these complex TFT observables. This approach encompasses existing counting methods and therefore recovers known results in specific limiting cases. We provide computational tools to facilitate the enumerations of these invariants.

## 5. Brackets in multicontact geometry and multisymplectization

**Authors:** Manuel de León, Rubén Izquierdo-López, Xavier Rivas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13224v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we introduce a graded bracket of forms on multicontact manifolds. This bracket satisfies a graded Jacobi identity as well as two different versions of the Leibniz rule. The Jacobi bracket also permits to study the evolution of observables and study the dissipation phenomena, which we also address. Finally, we apply the results to classical dissipative field theories. We develop the multisymplectization of multicontACT structures to relate these brackets to the ones present inmultisymplectic geometry.

## 6. On some classes of bivalent and trivalent planar graphs

**Authors:** Jorge Alencar, Jean-Guy Caputo, Leonardo de Lima, Arnaud Knippel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13199v1)

**Summary:**

A graph is called bivalent or trivalent if there exists an eigenvector of the graph Laplacian composed from {-1,1} or {- 1,0,1}, respectively. These bivalent andTrivalent eigenvectors are important for engineering applications, in particular for vibrating systems. In this article, we determine the structure of bivalent  graphs in the following planar graph families: trees, unicyclic, bicyclic, and cactus.

## 7. Singularity of the spectrum of typical minimal smooth area-preserving   flows in any genus

**Authors:** Krzysztof Frączek, Adam Kanigowski, Corinna Ulcigrai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13193v1)

**Summary:**

We consider smooth flows preserving a smooth invariant measure. We show that almost every locally Hamiltonian flow with only simple saddles has singular spectrum. Almost every pair of such flows is spectrally disjoint. The spectral result is proved using a criterion for singularity based on tightness of Birkhoff sums with exponential tails decay. Disjointness of pairs then follows by producing mixing times (for the second flow), using a new mechanism for shearing based on resonant rigidity times.

## 8. Repeated quantum backflow and overflow

**Authors:** Christopher J. Fewster, Harkan J. Kirk-Karakaya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13184v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13184v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum backflow is a phenomenon in which a quantum particle can exhibit a net probability transfer to the left-hand half-line over a finite time interval. In classical statistical particle mechanics, the total backflow lies in the interval $[-1,0]$ for all $M$, indicating rightwards probability transfer. We show that the maximum $M$-fold backflow in quantum mechanics is positive and unbounded from above. We call this effect "quantum overflow" The maximum extent of the backflow and overflow effects is described by a hierarchy of back flow and overflow functions and constants.

## 9. Dynamics and equilibrium states of infinite systems of lattice bosons

**Authors:** Andreas Deuchert, Jonas Lampart, Marius Lemm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13170v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the dynamics of systems of lattice bosons with infinitely many degrees of freedom. Their dynamics defines a group of automorphisms on a $C^*$--algebra. For states that admit uniform bounds on moments of the local particle number, we derive propagation bounds of Lieb--Robinson type. We show that the dynamics gives rise to a strongly continuous unitary group in the GNS representation. Moreover, accumulation points of finite-volume Gibbs states satisfy the KMS condition with respect to this group.

## 10. Persistence of integrable wave dynamics in the Discrete   Gross--Pitaevskii equation: the focusing case

**Authors:** G. Fotopoulos, N. I. Karachalios, V. Koukouloyannis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13139v1)

**Summary:**

The study looked at the proximity of dynamics between integrable and non-integrable systems within the framework of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. For the Discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation, they guarantee the long-term persistence of small-amplitude bright solitons, driven by the analytical solution of the AL lattice. They also reveal that the soliton exhibits remarkable robustness, even as the effects of the weak harmonic trap become increasingly significant.

## 11. On the mean-field limit of Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equations

**Authors:** Li Chen, Jinwook Jung, Peter Pickl, Zhenfu Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13038v1)

**Summary:**

The derivation of effective descriptions for interacting many-body systems is an important branch of applied mathematics. We prove a propagation of chaos result for a system of $N$ particles subject to Newtonian time evolution with or without additional white noise. We assume that the particles interact according to a regularized Coulomb-interaction with a regularization parameter that vanishes in the $N\to\infty$ limit. The respective effective description is the so called Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP)

## 12. Stark Energy Shifts due to Quantum Gravity in RGUP Algebra

**Authors:** Gaurav Bhandari, S. D. Pathak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12985v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the Stark effect in the hydrogen atom under an external electric field. We incorporate relativistic generalized uncertainty principle (RGUP) corrections within Minkowskian spacetime. The perturbed Hamiltonian, modified by RGUP, enfold quantum gravitational effects. These findings reduce to standard Stark effect results and non-relativistic GUP frameworks in the limits of the GUP framework. We establish our model as a generalized framework for analyzing minimal length effects in quantum systems.

## 13. On Folding Calabi-Yau Diagrams in M-theory Black Brane Scenarios

**Authors:** Adil Belhaj, Abderrahim Bouhouch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12948v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we reconsider the study of five-dimensional supersymmetric black branes in the context of the M-theory compactification. Combining colored graph theory and outer-automorphism group action techniques, we approach the tetra-quadric Calabi-Yau diagram leading to new features. Using a procedure referred to as folding, we show that the compactifications can be reduced to known compactifications with lower dimensional K\"{a}hler moduli spaces.

## 14. On the superintegrability of the Gaussian $β$ ensemble and its   $(q,t)$ generalisation

**Authors:** Sung-Soo Byun, Peter J. Forrester

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12927v1)

**Summary:**

Superintegrability is a property of certain probability density functions coming from matrix models. It relates to the average over a distinguished basis of symmetric functions, typically the Jack or Macdonald polynomials. We use results developed in a theory of multivariable Al-Salam and Carlitz polynumials to prove the superintegrable identity. This then is used to deduce a duality formula for these same averages, which in turn allows for a derivation of a functional equation for the spectral moments.

## 15. The Flea on the Magnetic Elephant

**Authors:** Pavel Exner, Léo Morin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12846v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate a two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian with two radially symmetric magnetic wells. If the tunneling is weak and the wells are mirror symmetric, the two lowest eigenfunctions are localized in both wells being distributed roughly equally. An exponentially small symmetry violation can in this situation have a dramatic effect. This is reminiscent of the `flea on the elephant' effect for Schr\"odinger operators; our result shows that it has a purely magnetic counterpart. We show that this effect can only occur when the wells have mirror symmetry.

## 16. Modified wave operators and scattering for linear wave equations with a   repulsive potential

**Authors:** Boya Fan, Ruipeng Shen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12838v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12838v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we consider the wave equation with a repulsive potential. We combine the operator theory and the inward/outward energy theory to deduce a modified wave operator. We show that the regular wave operator without modification exists if $\beta>1$. This implies that the asymptotic behaviour of finite-energy solutions to the wave equations is similar to that of the classic wave equation if $u_{tt} - \Delta u + |x|^{-\beta} u =0$

## 17. Spin-weighted spherical harmonics as total angular momentum eigenstates   for massless particles and their role in obstructing spin-orbital   decompositions

**Authors:** Eric Palmerduca, Hong Qin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12765v1)

**Summary:**

We show that for massless particles of helicity $h$, the angular momentum eigenstates are given in an appropriate coordinate system by the spin-weighted spherical harmonics. The resultant angular momentum multiplet structure is quite different than that of massive particles, with $|h|$ acting as a lower bound on $J^2$ and at most one multiplet for each angular momentum $j$. This illustrates the obstruction to a spin-orbital decomposition of the angular Momentum.

## 18. Asymptotic analysis for a class of planar orthogonal polynomials on the   unit disc

**Authors:** Alfredo Deaño, Ken McLaughlin, Leslie Molag, Nick Simm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12633v1)

**Summary:**

We carry out the asymptotic analysis as $n \to \infty$ of a class of orthogonal polynomials of degree $n$ defined with respect to the planar measure. This measure arises naturally in the study of characteristic polynmials of non-Hermitian ensembles and generalises the example of a Gaussian weight that was recently studied by several authors. The main approach is to convert thePlanar orthogonality to one defined on suitable contours in the complex plane.
