## 0. Renormalising Feynman diagrams with multi-indices

**Authors:** Yvain Bruned, Yingtong Hou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08151v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study the BPHZ renormalisation via multi-indices. The construction relies on a well-chosen extraction-contraction coproduct. We illustrate our construction on the renormalisations of the $ \Phi^4 $ measure. We propose the multi-Indices counterpart of the Hopf algebraic program initiated by Connes and Kreimer on therenormalisation of Feynman diagrams. It is a combinatorial structure extremely succesful for describing scalar valued singular SPDEs.

## 1. Solution to SU(n+1) Toda system generated by spherical metrics

**Authors:** Yiqian Shi, Chunhui Wei, Bin Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08132v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08132v1)

**Summary:**

We show that a spherical metric generates a family of solutions. We characterize this family in terms of the monodromy group of the spherical metric. As a consequence, we obtain a new solution class to the SU(n+1) Toda system with cone singularities on compact Riemann surfaces, complementing the existence results of Lin-Yang-Zhong (JDG, 114(2):337-391, 2020). We also show that this solution class is a new class of Toda systems.

## 2. Wasserstein distances and divergences of order $p$ by quantum channels

**Authors:** Gergely Bunth, József Pitrik, Tamás Titkos, Dániel Virosztek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08066v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a non-quadratic generalization of the quantum mechanical optimal transport problem. We introduce $p$-Wasserstein distances and divergences and study their fundamental geometric properties. Finally, we prove triangle inequality for quadratic Wasserstein Divergences under the sole assumption that an arbitrary one of the states involved is pure, which is a generalization in the direction of our previous result in this direction.

## 3. Categorical quantum symmetries and ribbon tensor 2-categories

**Authors:** Hank Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08041v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we prove that the 2-representation 2-category is braided, planar-pivotal, rigid and dagger. We explicitly construct the ribbon balancing functors, and show that it is compatible with the rigid dagger structures. Framed 2-tangles can then be decorated by 2- representations of categorical quantum groups with a ribbon 2-functor. This is completely analogous to the construction of decorated ribbon graphs in the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction.

## 4. The Clifford hierarchy for one qubit or qudit

**Authors:** Nadish de Silva, Oscar Lautsch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07939v1)

**Summary:**

The Clifford hierarchy is a nested sequence of sets of quantum gates that can be fault-tolerantly performed using gate teleportation within standard quantum error correction schemes. The groups of Pauli and Clifford gates constitute the first and second 'levels', respectively. Non-Clifford gates from the third level or higher, such as the $T$ gate, are necessary for achieving universal quantum computation. We express every such hierarchy gate uniquely as a product of three simple gates, yielding also a formula for the size of every level.

## 5. The Wigner Little Group for Photons Is a Projective Subalgebra

**Authors:** Moab Croft, Hamish Todd, Edward Corbett

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07909v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07909v1)

**Summary:**

This paper presents the Geometric Algebra approach to the Wigner little group for photons using the Spacetime Algebra. The shift from a point-based view to a mirror-based views is a modern movement that allows for a more intuitive representation of geometric and physical entities. The lightlike transformations (translations) in these little photon algebras are seen to leave invariant the (pseudo)canonical electromagetic field bivector. This provides for a framework that unifies the analysis of symmetries and substructures.

## 6. The one-dimensional equilibrium shape of a crystal

**Authors:** Emanuel Indrei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07900v1)

**Summary:**

Almgren problem is to infer if sub-level sets of g are convex. The theorem proven in the paper is that in one dimension the answer is positive. Optimizing the free energy under a mass constraint may generate a convex crystal subject to assumptions on the potential $g(0)=0$, $g \ge 0$. The general problem classically attributed to Almgren is to inference if this is the case assuming the sub- level sets of G are conveX.

## 7. Brill Waves with Slow Fall-Off Towards Spatial Infinity

**Authors:** Lydia Bieri, David Garfinkle, James Wheeler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07877v1)

**Summary:**

We compute families of solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations of the type of Brill waves. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for physical data. We numerically construct an explicit example with slow-off which does not exhibit antipodal symmetry at spatial infinity. We show that the solution to the vacuum equations does not have a slow fall-off towards spatial infinity, and that it is unique to the Brill waves of this type of wave. We conclude that the Einstein equations do not have slow fall off towards infinity.

## 8. Reality conditions for sin-Gordon equation and quasi-periodic solutions   in finite phase spaces

**Authors:** Julia Bernatska

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07862v1)

**Summary:**

Quasi-periodic solutions of the sin-Gordon equation are expressed in terms of a function. This new result leads to numerical computation and graphical representation of non-linear wave solutions. A way of obtaining finite-gap solutions by means of algebro-geometric integration is also explained. A construction of thesin-Gordon hierarchy on coadjoint orbits of a loop group is addressed. The result can be used to solve the equation for non- linear wave solutions, for example.

## 9. Large genus asymptotics of super Weil-Petersson volumes

**Authors:** Xuanyu Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07848v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the existence of a complete asymptotic expansion of super Weil-Petersson volumes in the large genus. This generalizes the celebrated work of Mirzakhani-Zograf. We also confirm two conjectural formulae proposed by Griguolo-Papalini-Russo-Seminara. We give an algorithm which can explicitly compute these coefficients. We conclude that the associated coefficients of super intersection numbers are polynomials, and that they can be written as polynoms.

## 10. Richardson-Gaudin states of non-zero seniority I: matrix elements

**Authors:** Paul A. Johnson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07803v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07803v1)

**Summary:**

Seniority-zero wavefunctions describe bond-breaking processes qualitatively. As eigenvectors of a model Hamiltonian, Richardson-Gaudin states provide a clear physical picture. The next manuscript in this series will identify the corresponding Slater-Condon rules and make the computations feasible. The proof of principle calculations demonstrate that a single reference configuration interaction is comparable with seniority-based configuration interaction computations at a substantially reduced cost. In every case, the couplings between the states are computed from the cofactors of their effective overlap matrix.

## 11. SymSETs and self-dualities under gauging non-invertible symmetries

**Authors:** Da-Chuan Lu, Zhengdi Sun, Zipei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07787v1)

**Summary:**

The self-duality defects under discrete gauging in a categorical symmetry can be classified by inequivalent ways of enriching the bulk SymTFT. The resulting Symmetry Enriched Topological (SET) orders will be referred to as $\textit{SymSETs}$ We provide a direct construction of the SymSET from a given duality defect using its $F$-symbols. We show explicitly that changing fractionalization classes can change fusion rules of theDuality defect.
