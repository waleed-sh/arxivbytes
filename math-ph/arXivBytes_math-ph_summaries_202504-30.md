## 0. A Complete Characterization of Passive Unitary Normalizable (PUN)   Gaussian States

**Authors:** Tiju Cherian John, Hemant K. Mishra, Saikat Guha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20979v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20979v1)

**Summary:**

We provide a complete characterization of the class of multimode quantum Gaussian states that can be reduced to a tensor product of thermal states using only a passive unitary operator. We call these states \textit{passive unitary normalizable} (PUN) GaussianStates. It is well-known that the so-called gauge-invariantGaussian states are PUN, but whether the converse is true is not known in the literature to the best of our knowledge.

## 1. A distance between operators acting in different Hilbert spaces and   operator convergence

**Authors:** Olaf Post, Jan Simmer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20971v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of the present article is to give an introduction to the concept of quasi-unitary equivalence. We define several (pseudo-)metrics on the space of self-adjoint operators acting possibly in different Hilbert spaces. As some of the ``metrics'' do not fulfill all properties of a metric, we call them ''distances'' Here, such distances are treated for the first time. The present article shall serve as a starting point of further research (see e.g. arXiv:2412.13165).

## 2. Phase space of a Poisson algebra and the induced Pre-Poisson bialgebra

**Authors:** You Wang, Yunhe Sheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20936v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20936v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we show that a Poisson algebra has a phase space if and only if it is sub-adjacent to a pre-Poisson algebra. We study coboundary pre- Poisson bialgebras, which leads to an analogue of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. We introduce the notions of quasi-triangular and factorizable pre- poisson bials as special cases. Based on this construction, we give the phase space for a Rota-B Baxter symplectic Poissongebra.

## 3. Mesoscopic Quantum Dynamics and Bosonization of Noise

**Authors:** Michele Fantechi, Marco Merkli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20891v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum systems that interact non-locally with an environment (or bath) serve as paradigms for exploring collective phenomena. They hold broad potential for applications in quantum computing and quantum sensing. We demonstrate that the effect of general environments on the system exhibits a universal bosonic character. The emergent 'bosonization' of the environment results from the mesoscopic coupling in the thermodynamic limit and can be interpreted as a manifestation of the central limit theorem. The effect has been observed in specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.

## 4. Freezing Phase Transitions for Lattice Systems and Higher-Dimensional   Subshifts

**Authors:** J. -R. Chazottes, T. Kucherenko, A. Quas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20881v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we prove that under a natural summability condition -- satisfied, for instance, by finite-range potentials or exponentially decaying potentials -- freezing phase transitions are impossible. This phenomenon was previously studied only for $d = 1$ in the context of dynamical systems and for restricted classes of subshifts, with significant motivation stemming from quasicrystal models. We explicitly construct a continuous potential for which there exists a critical inverse temperature depending on the potential. We also show that under this condition, the freezing phase transition is impossible.

## 5. Chaos Around the Kerr Black Hole: its Effects on Entropy and the Shadow

**Authors:** Aydin Tavlayan, Bayram Tekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876v1)

**Summary:**

Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit chaotic motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. In both of these cases, chaotic motion causes information production. This information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black Hole mass and spin. We show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics.

## 6. BV actions for extended geometry

**Authors:** Martin Cederwall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20873v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20873v1)

**Summary:**

I review the construction of actions for extended geometry from the grading of an underlying tensor hierarchy algebra. The dynamics is neatly encoded in a complex. This talk, presented at the Corfu Summer Institute 2024, is mainly based on joint work with J. Palmkvist, in particular ref. [1]. It is based on a paper published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics, published by the University of Helsinki, Finland, in 2010. The paper was published on behalf of the Finnish Academy of Sciences and Letters.

## 7. Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states

**Authors:** Kaoru Mizuta, Tomotaka Kuwahara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20746v1)

**Summary:**

Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. Recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by thelow-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost for low- energy initial states.

## 8. Nonsymmorphic Topological Phases of Non-Hermitian Systems

**Authors:** Daichi Nakamura, Yutaro Tanaka, Ken Shiozaki, Kohei Kawabata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20743v1)

**Summary:**

Non-Hermiticity appears ubiquitously in various open classical and quantum systems. However, the role of nonsymmorphic symmetry, crystalline symmetry accompanying fractional lattice translations, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we systematically classify non-Hermitsian topological crystalline phases protected by nonsymmmorphic symmetry and reveal unique phases that have no counterparts in either Hermitian or non-Internal topological phases. We also identify anomalous boundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.

## 9. Unitary ensembles with a critical edge point, their multiplicative   statistics and the Korteweg-de-Vries hierarchy

**Authors:** Mattia Cafasso, Carla Mariana da Silva Pinheiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20721v1)

**Summary:**

We study the multiplicative statistics associated to the limiting determinantal point process describing unitary random matrices. We prove that these statistics are governed by the first three equations of the KdV hierarchy. We also study the asymptotic behavior of the relevant solutions. We conclude that the limiting density vanishes like a power 5/2, and that the process can be viewed as a form of stochastic random number theory. Back to Mail Online home.

## 10. On three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry: maximally   supersymmetric backgrounds and massive deformations

**Authors:** Sergei M. Kuzenko, Emmanouil S. N. Raptakis, Igor B. Samsonov, Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20712v1)

**Summary:**

Using the $SO ({\cal N})$ superspace formulation, we derive all maximally supersymmetric backgrounds in the ${\cal N} =4$ case. We also demonstrate the generation of topologically massive supersymmetry gauge theories from radiative corrections in the hypermultiplet sector. Theories necessarily contain Chern-Simons terms at the component level. They originate as massive deformations of the following two families of theories in standard Minkowski superspace: (i) superconformal field theories; and (ii) supers asymmetric gauge theories.

## 11. Dressed fields for Quantum Chromodynamics

**Authors:** Iustus C. Hemprich, Karl-Henning Rehren

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20641v1)

**Summary:**

String-localized QFT allows to explain Standard Model interactions in an autonomous way, committed to quantum principles rather than a "gauge principle" The main tool are "dressed fields", that are intermediate between free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit formulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as non-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility, enabled by our approach, that traces of confinement may be visible already at the level of the dressed fields.

## 12. From Klein-Gordon-Wave to Schrödinger-Wave: a Normal Form Approach

**Authors:** Gaia Marangon, Antonio Ponno, Lorenzo Zanelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20576v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we consider a Klein-Gordon-Wave system, which couples the evolution of a massive field and a massless one through a Yukawa interaction. We derive its Hamiltonian normal form to second order. To the first-order approximation, the normal form results in a Schr\"odinger- wave system. A second-order approximations can be obtained by iterating our constructive procedure.

## 13. Beyond Robertson-Schrödinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling   Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs

**Authors:** Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Hiromichi Ohno, Jaeha Lee, Dariusz Chruściński

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404v1)

**Summary:**

We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024) We report a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed.

## 14. Inverse problems for the zeros of the Wigner function

**Authors:** Luís Daniel Abreu, Ulysse Chabaud, Nuno Costa Dias, João Nuno Prata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20324v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we consider the inverse problem of determining the properties of a Wigner function from the set of its zeros (the nodal set) The previous state of the art of the problem is Hudson's theorem. We extend this analysis to non-Gaussian functions. We also derive a counterpart of the sign uncertainty principle of J. Bourgain, L. Clozel and J.-P. Kahane, which says that if the negative part of a function is contained in a ball, then the radius of the ball has a lower bound.
