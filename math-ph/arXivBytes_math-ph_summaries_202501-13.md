## 0. Algebraic solutions for $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems:   generic statistical ensembles and a mesoscopic system application

**Authors:** Alex E. Bernardini, Roldao da Rocha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06182v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06182v1)

**Summary:**

Solutions of generic $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems are obtained through systematic manipulations of quartic polynomial equations. An ansatz for constructing separable and entangled eigenstate basis, depending on the quartic equation coefficients, is proposed. Besides the quantum concurrence for pure entangled states, the associated thermodynamic statistical ensembles, their partition function and quantum purity are shown to be straightforwardly obtained. Results are specialized to a $SU (2)otimes (SU( 2)$ structure emulated by lattice-layer degrees of freedom of the Bernal stacked graphene.

## 1. Exploring Metastability in Ising models: critical droplets, energy   barriers and exit time

**Authors:** Vanessa Jacquier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06163v1)

**Summary:**

This paper provides an overview of the research on the metastable behavior of the Ising model. The analysis is extended to related models, such as long-range Ising models, Blume-Capel and Potts models, as well as to dynamics like Kawasaki dynamics. It provides insights into metastability across different systems, including different lattices, dimensions and anisotropic variants.

## 2. The Role of Type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann Algebras and their Tensor   Structure in Quantum Gravity}}

**Authors:** Manfred Requardt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06009v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that the type classification of v.Neumann algebras play an important role in a theory of quantum gravity and quantum space-time physics. We provide arguments that type $II_1$ and its representation as a tensor product of an ordinary (exterior) Hilbert space algebra do represent the first step away from the semiclassical picture towards a full theory ofQuantum gravity. We also argue that type. $II_{\infty}$ is encoding, in our view, the hidden microscopic gravitational degrees of freedom.

## 3. A primer of the complex WKB method, with application to the ODE/IM   correspondence

**Authors:** Gabriele Degano, Davide Masoero

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05957v1)

**Summary:**

In these lectures, we provide an introduction to the complex WKB method. We use as a guiding example a class of anharmonic oscillators that appears in the ODE/IM correspondence. In the fourth and last lecture, we compute (and prove) the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum of the anharmony oscillators in two asymPTotic regimes, when the momentum is fixed and the energy is large, and when it is large. We conclude with a discussion of the main objects of the method.

## 4. A Contact Topological Glossary for Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics

**Authors:** Michael Entov, Leonid Polterovich, Lenya Ryzhik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05955v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the occurrence of some notions and results from contact topology in the non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This includes the Reeb chords and the partial order on the space of Legendrian submanifolds. We also discuss some notions of contact topologism and contact topography in the Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics. We conclude by discussing some of the ideas we have learned from the work of Robert Hooke and his colleagues in the field of Non-equilibration Thermodynamic Theory.

## 5. Finite-size scaling in the ageing dynamics of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising   model

**Authors:** Malte Henkel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05912v1)

**Summary:**

Single-time and two-time correlators are computed exactly in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model after a quench to zero temperature and on a periodic chain of finite length $N$, using a simple analytical continuation technique. Besides the general confirmation of finite-size scaling in non-equilibrium dynamics, this allows to test the scaling behaviour of the plateau height $C_{\infty}^{(2)}$ to which the two- time auto-correlator converges.

## 6. Quantum Speedup for Nonreversible Markov Chains

**Authors:** Baptiste Claudon, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pierre Monmarché

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05868v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum algorithms can potentially solve a handful of problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. This study uses modern quantum algorithmic techniques and Markov chain theory to sample from the stationary distribution of nonreversible Markov chains with faster worst-case runtime. Such an up-to-exponential quantum speedup goes beyond the predicted quadratic quantum acceleration for reversible chains. It is likely to have a decisive impact on many applications ranging from statistics and machine learning to computational modeling in physics, chemistry, biology and finance.

## 7. Maximality of the futures of points in globally hyperbolic maximal   conformally flat spacetimes

**Authors:** Rym Smaï

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05856v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that the indecomposable past/future sets (abbrev. IPs/IFs) of the universal cover of $M$ are domains of injectivity of the developing map. We show that they are conformally equivalent to regular domains of Minkowski spacetime as defined by F. Bonsante. We provide a new proof of a result of completeness by C. Rossi, which notably simplifies the original arguments. We establish that if, in addition, $M $ is maximal, the IPs and IFs are maximal as globally hyperbolic conformally flat spacetimes.

## 8. Dynamical Spreading Under Power Law Potential

**Authors:** Ido Fanto, Naomi Oppenheimer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05846v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the dynamic spreading of a dense overdamped suspension of particles under power law repulsive potentials, often called Riesz gases. We demonstrate that the density profiles differ significantly depending on whether k is larger than, smaller than, or equal to D-2, where D is the dimension. For k>D-2 the density is centered in the middle and we also notice a Wigner lattice emerging as a result of the repulsive interactions. We observed an interesting phenomenon when two or more suspensions are placed near each other: a particle-free zone is formed where the two populations meet.

## 9. Higher Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of super Riemann   surfaces

**Authors:** Xuanyu Huang, Kefeng Liu, Hao Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05806v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05806v1)

**Summary:**

Stanford-Witten derived a remarkable recursion formula of Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli space of super Riemann surfaces. It is the super version of the celebrated Mirzakhani's recursions formula. In this paper, we generalize Stanford- Witten's formula to include high degree kappa classes. We also show that the formula can be applied to the theory of JT supergravity, which is the basis for the supergravity theory. The paper is published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

## 10. Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical   overview

**Authors:** Leonardo Santilli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05794v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05794v1)

**Summary:**

The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

## 11. Dubrovin duality and mirror symmetry for ADE resolutions

**Authors:** Andrea Brini, Jingxiang Ma, Ian A. B. Strachan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05753v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05753v1)

**Summary:**

We show that, under Dubrovin's notion of ''almost'' duality, the Frobenius manifold structure on the orbit spaces of the extended affine Weyl groups is dual to the equivariant quantum cohomology of the du Val singularity. We also provide a uniform Lie-theoretic construction of Landau-Ginzburg mirrors. The mirror B-model is described by a one-dimensional LG superpotential associated to the spectral curve of the affine relativistic Toda chain.

## 12. Skein Construction of Balanced Tensor Products

**Authors:** Manuel Araújo, Jin-Cheng Guu, Skyler Hudson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05747v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of tensor categories has found applications across various fields. In essence, it is a categorification of the classical theory of algebras and modules. We introduce a topological construction based on skein theory that offers a better mix of algebra and topology. This approach not only works for products of multiple module categories, but also provides the missing key to proving that the Turaev-Viro state sum model naturally arises from the 3-functor in the classification of fully extended field theories.

## 13. A fast algorithmic way to calculate the degree growth of birational   mappings

**Authors:** Basil Grammaticos, Alfred Ramani, Adrian Stefan Carstea, Ralph Willox

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05650v1)

**Summary:**

The method uses only integer arithmetic with additions and, in some cases, multiplications by small integers. It is therefore extremely fast. Several examples of integrable and non-integrable mappings are presented. In the latter case the dynamical degree we obtain from our method is always in agreement with that calculated by previously known methods. We present an algorithmic method for the calculation of the degrees of the iterates of birational mappings, based on Halburd's method for obtaining the degrees from the singularity structure.
