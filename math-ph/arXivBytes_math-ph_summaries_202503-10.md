## 0. Quantum State Designs from Minimally Random Quantum Circuits

**Authors:** Jonathon Riddell, Katja Klobas, Bruno Bertini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05698v1)

**Summary:**

Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth.

## 1. Epstein curves and holography of the Schwarzian action

**Authors:** Franco Vargas Pallete, Yilin Wang, Catherine Wolfram

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05690v1)

**Summary:**

We show identities between the Schwarzian action of a circle diffeomorphism and the hyperbolic area enclosed by the Epstein curve. We also show the monotonicity of the Loewner energy along its equipotential foliation. We obtain two new proofs of the non-negativity of the Schwarzians action for circle Diffeomorphisms. We show that the bi-local observables on the edges of any ideal triangulation of $\mathbb{D}$ determine the circle diffEomorphism.

## 2. Characterization of the spectra of rotating truncated gas planets and   inertia-gravity modes

**Authors:** Maarten V. de Hoop, Sean Holman, Alexei Iantchenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05428v1)

**Summary:**

We study the essential spectrum, which corresponds to inertia-gravity modes, of the system of equations governing a rotating and self-gravitating gas planet. We show how it splits from the portion of the spectrum corresponding to the acoustic modes. The fundamental mathematical tools in our analysis are a generalization of the Helmholtz decomposition and the Lopantinskii conditions. We rigorously and precisely characterize the essentialSpectrum of a rotating gas planet with certain boundary conditions. The essential spectrum can be seen in the image below.

## 3. Quantum Dual Extended Hamming Code Immune to Collective Coherent Errors

**Authors:** En-Jui Chang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05249v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05249v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for protecting quantum information from various error sources. In this work, we propose a novel family of constant excitation (CE) stabilizer codes. These codes are constructed by concatenating an inner complemented dual-rail (CDR) code with a classical outer $[2^r, 2^r-(r+1), 4]$ extended Hamming code. Our results contribute to the ongoing development of high-rate, fault-tolerant QEC schemes suitable for practical quantum computing.

## 4. Homotopy Wave Function in Algebraic Geometry

**Authors:** Renaud Gauthier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05099v1)

**Summary:**

We propose the homotopy shape of the Segal topos of derived stacks over simplicial k-algebras as the higher homotopical generalization of the concept of wave function in Quantum Mechanics. We propose the. Segal. topos as a higher homotsopical. generalization. of the. concept of the wave function. In this paper, we show that this is the case in the case of a wave function of the form Segal topos. We also show that the shape of Segal Topos is the same as that of the Wave function.

## 5. Poisson homogeneous spaces of Poisson 2-groups

**Authors:** Honglei Lang, Zhangju Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05080v1)

**Summary:**

Drinfeld classified Poisson homogeneous spaces of a Poisson Lie group in terms of Dirac structures of the Lie bialgebra. In this paper, we study homogeneous Spaces of a 2-group and develop Drinfeld theorem in the Poisson 2- group context. We also show that Drinfeld's theorem can be applied to Poisson spaces of 2-groups. We conclude that the Drinfeld conjecture can be used to study Poisson Homogeneous Spaces in 2- groups.
