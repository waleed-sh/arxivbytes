## 0. Real operator systems

**Authors:** David P. Blecher, Travis B. Russell

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12126v1)

**Summary:**

 complex operator systems are an important category containing the C*-algebras and von Neumann algebr as. They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject. In the final two sections of our paper we study real versions of the Kirchberg conjectures etc, and show that they are equivalent.

## 1. High-dimensional long-range statistical mechanical models have random   walk correlation functions

**Authors:** Yucheng Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12104v1)

**Summary:**

We consider long-range percolation, Ising model, and self-avoiding walk. We show that the two-point function for each of these models exactly coincides with a random walk function, up to a constant prefactor. We also give a simple proof of the convergence of the lace expansion, assuming diagrammatic estimates. We prove a uniform upper bound of the form $|x|^{-(d-\alpha) \min\{ 1, (p_c - p)^{-2} |x|^-2\alpha} \}$

## 2. Semiclassical trace formula for the Bochner-Schrödinger operator

**Authors:** Yuri A. Kordyukov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12087v1)

**Summary:**

We study the semiclassical Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator on tensor powers $L^p$ of a Hermitian line bundle. We prove that its smooth Schwartz kernel on the diagonal admits a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of $p^{-1}$ in the semiclassesical limit $p\to \infty$. In particular, when the manifold is compact, we get acomplete asymPTotic expansion for the trace of $varphi(H_p)$

## 3. Non-invertible symmetry breaking in a frustration-free spin chain

**Authors:** Akash Sinha, Vivek Kumar Singh, Pramod Padmanabhan, Kun Hao, Vladimir Korepin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11997v1)

**Summary:**

A nearest-neighbor, frustration-free spin chain can be constructed using projectors of various ranks. We show that in the rank 1 case this system is gapped and has two ground states resembling ferromagnetic states. These states spontaneously break the non-invertible symmetry connecting them. The latter is proved using the machinery of algebraic quantum theory. The non- invertible symmetries of this system do not come from a duality. We conclude that the system is not symmetric.

## 4. Variational Quantum Algorithms for Many-Body Systems

**Authors:** Mirko Consiglio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11985v1)

**Summary:**

 Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) incorporate hybrid quantum-classical computation. They are aimed at harnessing the power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers to solve challenging computational problems. In this thesis, three main VQAs are presented, each tackling a different facet of many-body physics.

## 5. Unitary orthonormal bases of finite dimensional inclusions

**Authors:** Keshab Chandra Bakshi, B V Rajarama Bhat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11821v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11821v1)

**Summary:**

We study unitary orthonormal bases in the sense of Pimsner and Popa for inclusions. They generalize complex Hadamard matrices, Weyl unitary bases, and a recent work of Crann et al which correspond to the special cases of abelian, simple, and general multi-matrix algebras. As a further application, we prove the existence of such bases for a large class of depth 2 subfactors with abelians relative commutant.

## 6. A purely analytic derivation of Bonnet surfaces

**Authors:** Robert Conte, A. Michel Grundland

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11815v1)

**Summary:**

Bonnet has characterized his surfaces by a geometric condition. What is done here is a characterization of the same surfaces by two analytic conditions: (i) the mean curvature $H$ of a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ should admit a reduction to an ordinary differential equation; (ii) this latter equation should possess the Painlev\'e property. The result is that Bonnet's surfaces can be characterized by the geometric condition, and the analytic condition, respectively.

## 7. Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential

**Authors:** P. L. Krapivsky, Baruch Meerson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11796v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11796v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blow up time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short- time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-Law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions.

## 8. Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises

**Authors:** Sergei Kuksin, Armen Shirikyan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699v1)

**Summary:**

The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.

## 9. Open orbits in causal flag manifolds, modular flows and wedge regions

**Authors:** Karl-Hermann Neeb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11635v1)

**Summary:**

We study open orbits of symmetric subgroups of a simple connected Lie group G on a causal flag manifold. A key motivation is the geometry of corresponding modular flows. The open orbits are reductive causal symmetric spaces, which arise in two flavors:   compactly causal and non-compactly causal ones. We discuss the Lorentzian case, involving de Sitter   and anti-de Sitter space in some detail. We conclude that the open orbits can be used to study quantum field theory.

## 10. A note on optimization of the second positive Neumann eigenvalue for   parallelograms

**Authors:** Vladimir Lotoreichik, Jonathan Rohleder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11542v1)

**Summary:**

The Neumann Laplacian is maximized, among all planar convex domains of fixed perimeter, by the rectangle with one edge length equal to twice the other. In this note we prove that this conjecture is true within the class of parallelogram domains. It has recently been conjectured by Bogosel, Henrot, and Michetti that the second positive eigenvalue of the NeumannLaplacians is maximized by the rectangle. We prove this conjecture to be true.

## 11. Non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast processes

**Authors:** K. S. Glavatskiy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11530v1)

**Summary:**

A simple expression for the non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast transient processes is proposed. The proposed theory is validated by deriving the known law of inertial heat conduction, which accounts for finite speed of thermal propagation. A rigorous threshold between "slow" and "fast" processes is suggested, identifying the range of applicability of classical quasi-equ equilibrium description. Finally, a new expression is derived, revealing two kinds of pressure that emerge in fast non-Equilibrium.

## 12. A non-trivial conservation law with a trivial characteristic

**Authors:** Kostya Druzhkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11502v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the conservation law of the overdetermined system $u_t - 4u_x^3 - u_{xxx} = 0$ is non-trivial despite the characteristic vanishing on the system. The conservation law is related to the characteristic $u_{xy}, 0)$, which vanishes on $u t - $u x + $u y = 0' and $u z = 0. We show that this law is not a result of the characteristic disappearing.

## 13. Semiclassical scar on tori in high dimension

**Authors:** Huanhuan Yuan, Yong Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11445v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11445v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint elliptic $H-$differential operator $P_{h}(t)$ exhibits semiclassical scar phenomena on the $d-$dimensional torus. The equivalence is described as: for almost all perturbed Hamiltonian's KAM Lagrangian tori, there exists a semiclassicals measure with positive mass on $Lambda_{\omega}$. The premise is that we can obatain a family of quasimodes for the $h-$ differential operator$ in the semiclassically limit as $h\rightarrow0$, under the $\sigma$-Bruno-R\'smann condition.

## 14. Uniform-in-time asymptotic limits of generalized Kuramoto models

**Authors:** Hangjun Cho, Seung-Yeal Ha, Myeongju Kang, Chan Ho Min

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11392v1)

**Summary:**

We study two uniform-in-time asymptotic limits for generalized Kuramoto (GK) models. In the mean-field limit setting, the number of particles tends to infinity. On the other hand, in a continuum limit setting (the lattice size tends to zero), we show that the lattice GKM solutions converge to a classical solution to the continuum GK model in supremum norm. The results improve earlier results for the generalized GK type models, we say.
