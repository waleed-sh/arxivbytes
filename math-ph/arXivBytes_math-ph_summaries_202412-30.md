## 0. On dual-projectively equivalent connections associated to second order   superintegrable systems

**Authors:** Andreas Vollmer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19739v1)

**Summary:**

In projective differential geometry, pre-geodesics of an affine connection are curves that are geodesics after a reparametrization. Superintegrable systems are Hamiltonian systems with a large number of independent constants of the motion. Famous examples include the Kepler-Coulomb and the harmonic oscillator systems, which are foundational models in the Sciences. We show that certain torsion-free affine connections which are naturally associated to certain second order superintegrability systems share the same dual-geodeics.

## 1. High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications

**Authors:** Jacopo Borga, Andrew Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730v1)

**Summary:**

Permutons are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals. We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d-dimensional permutons. We determine the random high-dimensionalpermuton limits for two natural families of high- dimensional permutations. The limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional Permutons. They share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree.

## 2. The non-standad logic of physics: the case of the Boltzmann-Sinai   hard-sphere system

**Authors:** Massimo Tessarotto, Claudio Cremaschini, Claudio Asci, Alessandro Soranzo, Marco Tessarotto, Gino Tironi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19716v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19716v1)

**Summary:**

The Boltzmann-Sinai dynamical system is represented by the ensemble of classical smooth hard-spheres. Depending on the initial conditions which are prescribed for such a system, its classical state is shown to obey the propositional calculus of non-classical logic. In particular, the latter is expressed by the 3-way Principle of Non-Contradiction, namely the same logical principle that holds for quantum logic. The result therefore permits to question on a mathematical basis the principles of deterministic classical logic.

## 3. All Finite (Anti)Hermitian Irreducible Representations of the de Sitter   and Anti-de Sitter Lie Algebras and Their Lorentz Structure

**Authors:** Richard A. W. Bradford

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19708v1)

**Summary:**

Work on the representations of the de Sitter group has focussed on the unitary case. Here we address the finite dimensional representations resulting from the requirement that the Lie algebra generators are either Hermitian or anti-Hermitian. These irreducible representations (irreps) are based on backbones defined as the homogeneous Lorentz sub-algebra. The two Casimir invariants can be specified in terms of a single integral or half-integral parameter, p.

## 4. Continuous majorization in quantum phase space with Wigner negativity

**Authors:** Jan de Boer, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Erik Tonni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698v1)

**Summary:**

In discrete variable quantum computation, stabilizer operations naturally produce an order between input and output states. The order results in inequalities for magic monotones. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. This concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023) In this work, we develop the theory of continuousmajorization in the general $N$- mode case.

## 5. Casimir Radial Parts via Matsuki Decomposition

**Authors:** Philip Schlösser, Mikhail Isachenkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19681v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19681v1)

**Summary:**

We use Matsuki's decomposition for symmetric pairs of reductive Lie groups to construct the radial parts for differential operators acting on matrix-spherical functions. As an application, we employ this machinery to formulate an alternative, mathematically rigorous approach to obtaining radial parts of Casimir operators that appear in the theory of conformal blocks. We argue that Matsuki’s decomposition provides a proper mathematical framework for analysing the correspondence between Casimir equations and the Calogero-Sutherland-type models.

## 6. Multipole moments in stationary spacetimes

**Authors:** Jorn van Voorthuizen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19667v1)

**Summary:**

Multipole moments in general relativity serve as a powerful tool for characterising the gravitational field. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition. We formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. We discuss how the multipole moments behave under certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how they behave under such transformations.

## 7. Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry

**Authors:** Zhian Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19657v1)

**Summary:**

We develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of aweak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state. The model is inspired by a weak hopf algebra generalized to a tensor product Hilbert space. It is based on symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT)

## 8. Branes and Representations of DAHA $C^\vee C_1$: affine braid group   action on category

**Authors:** Junkang Huang, Satoshi Nawata, Yutai Zhang, Shutong Zhuang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19647v1)

**Summary:**

We study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra. We show a one-to-one correspondence between Lagrangian $A$-branes with compact support. The $D_4$ root system plays an essential role in understanding both the geometry and representation theory. As a by-product, our geometric investigation offers detailed information about the low-energy dynamics of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ Seiberg-Witten theory.

## 9. Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and   the K-identities

**Authors:** Sheng-Hong Lai, Jen-Chi Lee, Yi Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases. We propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringyScale behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-Identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K- identities for some higher point HSSA .

## 10. A non-semisimple non-invertible symmetry

**Authors:** Clement Delcamp, Edmund Heng, Matthew Yu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19635v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the action of a non-semisimple, non-invertible symmetry on spin chains. The topological defects encode the category of modules over the Taft algebra of dimension 4. We find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry. We further relate the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit to the notion that they are associated with a simple object and its projective cover, respectively.

## 11. An impediment to torsion from spectral geometry

**Authors:** Arkadiusz Bochniak, Ludwik Dąbrowski, Andrzej Sitarz, Paweł Zalecki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626v1)

**Summary:**

No convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the Torsion shall be excluded from the consideration of general relativity. We conclude that there are no convincing arguments to support the inclusion of theTorsion in a general relativity model.

## 12. Quasicrystal problem -- on rigidity of non-periodic structures from   statistical mechanics point of view

**Authors:** Jacek Miȩkisz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19594v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss stability of non-periodic tilings and one-dimensional sequences of symbols seen as ground states of some hamiltonians. We argue that some sort of homogeneity, the so-called Strict Boundary Condition, is necessary for stability. We present a brief history of quasicrystals and a short introduction to classical lattice-gas models of interacting particles. We conclude with a discussion of the role of quantum mechanics in the study of quantum computing. We hope this article will help you understand the history of quantum chemistry.

## 13. Elliptic triad

**Authors:** A. Mironov, A. Morozov, A. Popolitov, Z. Zakirova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19588v1)

**Summary:**

The triad refers to embedding the Macdonald polynomials into the Noumi-Shiraishi functions. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory. The central unknown ingredient is linear equations. We discuss various possible approaches, including immediate elliptic deformation of periodicity conditions and (elliptic) Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra operators. We also discuss lifting the triad to an elliptic generalization of the Nouimi-Shirahis functions.

## 14. Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories:   Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their   descriptions by (mock) modular covariant

**Authors:** Yoshiki Fukusumi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577v1)

**Summary:**

We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase.

## 15. Superintegrability of the Wilson family of matrix models and moments of   multivariable orthogonal polynomials

**Authors:** Victor Mishnyakov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19574v1)

**Summary:**

We present new examples of superintegrable matrix/eigenvalue models. These examples arise as a result of the exploration of the relationship between the theory of superIntegrability and multivariate orthogonal polynomials. The new examples are built upon the multivariate generalizations of the Meixner-Pollaczek and Wilson polynmials and their respective measures. We propose expressions for (generalized) moments of the respective multi-variable measures. From the perspective ofsuperintegrability we uncover a couple of new phenomena.

## 16. Quantum K-theory and Integrability

**Authors:** Peter Koroteev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19570v1)

**Summary:**

This is a contribution to the proceedings of the GLSM@30 conference, which was held in May 2023 at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics. In this note, we explore some recent advancements in enumerative algebraic geometry, focusing particularly on the role of quantum K-theory of quiver varieties as viewed through the lens of integrable systems. We highlight a number of conjectures and open questions. We also highlight some of the most interesting conjectures.

## 17. Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems

**Authors:** Simon Lyakhovich, nikit Sinelnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations restricting the trajectory. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from a requirement that this gauge variation ofThe action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not Lagrangian as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket.

## 18. On the Symmetry of Odd Leech Lattice CFT

**Authors:** Masaki Okada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19430v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the Mathieu groups do not lift to subgroups of the automorphism group of the odd Leech lattice. This study is motivated by the moonshine-type observation on the extremal elliptic genus of central charge 24 by [Benjamin, Dyer, Fitzpatrick, Kachru arXiv:1507.00004]. We also investigate weight-1 and weight-$\frac{3}{2}$ currents invariant under the subgroup.
