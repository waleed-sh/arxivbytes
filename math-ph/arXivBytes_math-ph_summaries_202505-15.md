## 0. Quantifying complexity of continuous-variable quantum states via Wehrl   entropy and Fisher information

**Authors:** Siting Tang, Francesco Albarelli, Yue Zhang, Shunlong Luo, Matteo G. A. Paris

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09613v1)

**Summary:**

The notion of complexity of quantum states is quite different from uncertainty or information contents, and involves the tradeoff between its classical and quantum features. In this work, we introduce a quantifier of. complexity of continuous-variable states, e.g. quantum optical states, based on the Husimi quasiprobability distribution. This quantity is built upon two functions of the state: the Wehrl entropy, capturing the spread of the distribution, and the Fisher information with respect to location parameters, which captures the opposite behaviour.

## 1. The Magnus expansion for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians

**Authors:** Yair Mulian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09559v1)

**Summary:**

The Magnus expansion offers a method to express a time-ordered exponential as an ordinary operatorial exponential. This representation has advantageous theoretical properties, while still solving the original differential equation. For any finite dimensional Hermitian Hamiltonians, the standard Magnus expansion guarantees a manifestly unitary representation. This property is no longer preserved if the Hamiltonian is infinite dimensional or non-Hermitian. In this work, we derive a generalized expansion that maintains the property of unitarity for all bounded finite dimensional Hamiltonians.

## 2. Variational formulations of transport on combinatorial meshes

**Authors:** Kiprian Berbatov, Andrey P. Jivkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09443v1)

**Summary:**

We develop analogues of the conservation laws describing transport of scalar physical properties for topological spaces referred to as cell complexes. The development is based on a calculus with combinatorial differential forms which is a discrete analogue of the smooth exterior calculus with differential forms. We discuss how the obtained formulation is specialised for several different problems, including mass diffusion, heat conduction, fluid flow in porous media, and charge diffusion. Examples and results for selected boundary value problems are given to demonstrate the capabilities of the CMC formulations.

## 3. Probabilistic construction of non compactified imaginary Liouville field   theory

**Authors:** Romain Usciati, Colin Guillarmou, Remi Rhodes, Raoul Santachiara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09390v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a probabilistic construction of imaginary Liouville Field Theory based on a real (non-compactified) Gaussian Free Field. We argue that our theory is the first explicit Lagrangian field theory that reproduces the imaginary DOZZ structure constants without requiring a neutrality constraint. Our proposal is supported by exact results for the imaginary Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos on the circle, and by numerical simulations on the sphere. In particular, we show that the three-point functions of the theory agree remarkably well with the imaginary DoZZ structure constant.

## 4. On the topology of the magnetic lines of large solutions to the   Magnetohydrodynamic equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$

**Authors:** Renato Lucà, Claudia Peña

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09340v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we introduce a new class of global strong solutions to the magnetohydrodynamic system. We impose a smallness condition on the difference $u_0-b_0$. Then we use this result to prove magnetic reconnection for a suitable class of (large) solutions. The proof relies on counting the number of hyperbolic critical points of the solutions, and this instance is structurally stable. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to show that a class of strong solutions with initial data of arbitrarily large size in any critical space.

## 5. Fully analytical propagator for lunar satellite orbits in closed form

**Authors:** Rita Mastroianni, Edoardo Legnaro, Christos Efthymiopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09241v1)

**Summary:**

We present a fully analytical propagator for the orbits of lunar artificial satellites in a lunar gravity and third-body model. The gravity model includes the twelve most important lunar gravity harmonics as well as the Earth's quadrupole tidal terms. The theory is based on deriving an approximate analytical solution of the secular part of the equations of motion using a Hamiltonian normal form in closed form. Open software python and symbolic routines implementing our propagator are provided in the repository [14]. Precision tests with respect to fully numerical orbital propagation in Cartesian coordinates are reported.

## 6. Magnetized Letelier black hole in AdS spacetime

**Authors:** Ahmad Al-Badawi, Faizuddin Ahmed, İzzet Sakallı, Sanjar Shaymatov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156v1)

**Summary:**

The study looked at the motion of charged, neutral, and light-like particles in a magnetized black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background. We demonstrate that key parameters characterizing the geometry-such as the cloud ofstrings parameter, the magnetic field strength, and the AdS radius-significantly affect the trajectories of these particles. These findings provide potential observables for distinguishing between different black hole models in realistic astrophysical environments.

## 7. Localization for heavy-tailed Anderson models

**Authors:** Omar Hurtado

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09079v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09079v1)

**Summary:**

We prove localization for one dimensional Anderson models with heavy tails. Using recent results on uniform large deviation estimates for random matrix products obtained by S. Raman and the author, we show localization for Anderson models. We also show that Anderson models can be used to predict the shape of the human body. We conclude that the Anderson model is a good model for predicting human shape and size. We present our results in a paper published in the Journal of Computer Science and the Arts, published by the University of Pennsylvania.

## 8. Entropy in Loop Quantum Cosmology

**Authors:** Alejandro Corichi, Omar Gallegos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09055v1)

**Summary:**

The Generalized First Law (GFL) and the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics are searched for effective and alternative cosmic models. The general conditions of the GSL validity are analyzed for the entropy as a general function and for logarithmic corrections to the usual Black Hole entropy. In addition, we explore the possibility of having negative temperature, where the validity conditions for an alternative generalized second law (AGSL) are studied. We study the regions where the GFL is valid for an effective Loop Quantum Cosmology model with spatially flat curvature.

## 9. The Anti-Unitarity of Time Reversal & Co-representations of Lorentzian   Pin Groups

**Authors:** Craig McRae

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09041v1)

**Summary:**

In the representation theory of Lorentzian orthogonal groups, there are well known arguments as to why the parity inversion operator and the time reversal operator should be realized as linear and anti-linear operators respectively. Despite this, standard constructions of double covers naturally build time reversal operators in such a manner that they are linear. This article introduces a viewpoint naturally incorporating the anti- linearity into the construction of these double covers, through what Wigner called co-representations, a kind of semi-linear representation.
