## 0. Integrability of the Kondo model with time dependent interaction   strength

**Authors:** Parameshwar R. Pasnoori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20125v1)

**Summary:**

Using the Bethe ansatz framework, an exact solution to the time dependent Schrodinger equation is constructed. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation. The framework developed in this work is general and provides a method to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra. The work is published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by Oxford University Press.

## 1. Critical dynamical fluctuations in reaction-diffusion processes

**Authors:** Benoit Dagallier, Claudio Landim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20008v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20008v1)

**Summary:**

We study dynamical fluctuations of the density field at the critical point. We show that magnetisation fluctuations are non-Gaussian and characterise their limit as the solution of a non-linear SDE. The proof relies on a decoupling of slow and fast modes relying in particular on a relative entropy argument. Major technical difficulties include the fact that local equilibrium does not hold due to the non- linearity, and proving replacement estimates on diverging time intervals due to critical slowdown. We prove, furthermore, that other observables remain fast.

## 2. Ultraviolet Renormalization of the van Hove-Miyatake Model: an Algebraic   and Hamiltonian Approach

**Authors:** Marco Falconi, Benjamin Hinrichs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19977v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19977v1)

**Summary:**

In this short communication we discuss the ultraviolet renormalization of the van Hove-Miyatake scalar field. An abstract algebraic approach is based on the study of a special class of ground states of the dynamical map. The two approaches are proved to yield equivalent results. We conclude that the two approaches to renormalize the field are equivalent to each other and can be used to form a new type of algebraic field.

## 3. Robust quantification of spectral transitions in perturbed quantum   systems

**Authors:** Zsolt Szabó, Stefan Gehr, Paolo Facchi, Kazuya Yuasa, Daniel Burgarth, Davide Lonigro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19904v1)

**Summary:**

A quantum system subject to an external perturbation can experience leakage between uncoupled regions of its energy spectrum separated by a gap. To quantify this phenomenon, we present two complementary results. First, we establish time-independent bounds on the distances between the true dynamics and the dynamics generated by block-diagonal effective evolutions. Second, we prove that, under the right conditions, this leakage remains small eternally, ensuring its validity for arbitrarily large times. Our approach only requires a finite spectral gap, thus accommodating continuous and unbounded spectra.

## 4. Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations

**Authors:** Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Haruki Yamashita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861v1)

**Summary:**

We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation. The conventional constant 1/4 is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient with the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator. Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus, thereby generalizing the Arthurs-Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.

## 5. On the asymptotic scaling of the von Neumann entropy in quasifree   fermionic right mover/left mover systems

**Authors:** Walter H. Aschbacher

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19783v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19783v1)

**Summary:**

For the general class of quasifree fermionic right mover/left mover systems, we study the von Neumann entropy of a contiguous subsystem of finite length in interaction with its environment. We prove that its leading order density is, in general, nonvanishing and displays the signature of a mixture of the independent thermal species. As special cases, the formalism covers so-called nonequilibrium steady states, thermal equilibrium states, and ground states. For general Fermi functions, we derive a necessary and sufficient criterion for the vonNeumann entropy density to vanish.

## 6. A space-dependent Boltzmann-BGK model for gas mixtures and its   hydrodynamic limits

**Authors:** Marzia Bisi, Maria Groppi, Giorgio Martalò

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19735v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19735v1)

**Summary:**

We present a hybrid Boltzmann-BGK model for inert mixtures. We prove that this model guarantees conservations of species masses, global momentum and energy. This model leads to the expected Maxwellian equilibria with all species sharing the same mean velocity and the same temperature. We investigate then such mixed kinetic equations in three different hydrodynamic limits: the classical collision dominated regime, a situation with dominant intra-species collisions, and a mixture with heavy and light particles leading to a kinetic-fluid description.

## 7. Local isometric immersions of pseudospherical surfaces described by a   class of third order partial differential equations

**Authors:** Mingyue Guo, Zhenhua Shi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19728v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19728v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the problem of local isometric immersion of pseudospherical surfaces determined by the solutions of a class of third order nonlinear partial differential equations. We prove that there is only two subclasses of equations for which the coefficients of the second fundamental form depend on a jet of finite order of $u$, and furthermore, these coefficients are universal. Finally, we show that the generalized Camassa-Holm equation describing pseudosp spherical surfaces has a universal second fundamentalform.

## 8. A duality of Bethe algebras for general linear Lie (super)algebras

**Authors:** Wan Keng Cheong, Ngau Lam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19661v1)

**Summary:**

We study the joint action of the Bethe algebra. for the general linear Lie algebra. We establish a duality, called the. Bethe duality of $d(p+m)$ bosonic and $d (q+n)$ fermionic oscillators. We show that the action of. $B$ on each weight space of the evaluation module is diagonalizable with a. simple spectrum on the weight space for generic $w$ and $z$ We conclude that there is an equivalence between the actions of the algebras.

## 9. On novel Hamiltonian description of the nonholonomic Suslov problem

**Authors:** A. V. Tsiganov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19594v1)

**Summary:**

We present some new Poisson bivectors that are invariants by the flow of the nonholonomic Suslov problem. Two rank four invariant Poisson bivectors have globally defined Casimir functions and, therefore, define cubic Poisson brackets on the five dimensional state space with standard symplectic leaves. For the Suslov gyrostat in the potential field we found rank two Poisson  Bivectors having only two globally definedCasimir functions. We say about formal Hamiltonian description in these cases.

## 10. Multipole Distributions and Hyper-Flux Fields

**Authors:** Vladimir Gol'dshtein, Reuven Segev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19559v1)

**Summary:**

We outline here a simple mathematical introduction to the notions of multipoles for a general extensive property of continuum mechanics. The proposed framework allows a simple computation of the bound "charges" and bound multipoles of lower orders. We consider hyper-fluxes -- flux fields of tensorial order greater than one -- and show that moving multipoles (in particular, a moving dielectric) give rise to hyper-Fluxes. In addition, if the property $\Pi$ has a potential function in the sense described below, a general expression for the mechanical force (power) functional acting on bodies containing the property is presented.
