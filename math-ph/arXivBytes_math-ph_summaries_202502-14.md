## 0. The Eigenfunctions of the Transfer Operator for the Dyson model in a   field

**Authors:** Mirmukhsin Makhmudov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09588v1)

**Summary:**

This paper aims to bridge the gap in the literature by investigating the Dyson model in a field. In this paper, we prove that, for high temperatures or strong magnetic fields, there exists a non-negative, integrable eigenfunction of the transfer operator. However, unlike in the zero-magnetic-field case, this eigen function is not continuous. This paper is a continuation of \cite{EFMV2024} and aims to build on that work.

## 1. Nonmodal amplitude equations

**Authors:** Yves-Marie Ducimetière, François Gallaire

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09572v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09572v1)

**Summary:**

We consider fluid flows for which the linearized Navier-Stokes operator is strongly non-normal. The responses of such flows to external perturbations are spanned by a generically very large number of (non-orthogonal) eigenmodes. We propose a method to analytically derive a weakly nonlinear amplitude equation for the nonmodal response of a fluid flow to a small harmonic forcing, stochastic forcing, and initial perturbation. Eventually, the three derived amplitude equations are tested in three distinct flows.

## 2. Gabor systems with Hermite functions of order n and oversampling greater   n+1 which are not frames

**Authors:** Markus Faulhuber

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09510v1)

**Summary:**

We show that a sufficient density condition for Gabor systems with Hermite functions over lattices is not sufficient in general. This follows from a result on how zeros of the Zak transform determine the frame property of integer over-sampled Gabor system. We also show that the density condition is not necessary for all lattices to have Hermite functions over lattices. We conclude that this is not the case for most lattices, and that it is not sufficient in general.

## 3. Quantitative estimates for high-contrast random media

**Authors:** Peter Bella, Matteo Capoferri, Mikhail Cherdantsev, Igor Velčić

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09493v1)

**Summary:**

This paper studies quantitative homogenization of elliptic equations with random, uniformly elliptic coefficients that vanish in a union of random holes. We derive optimal bounds for the regularity radius $r_*$ and suboptimal growth estimates for the corrector. These results are key ingredients for error analysis in stochastic homogenizing. They also serve as crucial input for recent developments in the double-porosity model, such as those by Bonhomme, Duerinckx, and Gloria.

## 4. Run-and-tumble particles with 1D Coulomb interaction: the active jellium   model and the non-reciprocal self-gravitating gas

**Authors:** Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09466v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09466v1)

**Summary:**

Recently we studied $N$ run-and-tumble particles in one dimension. We consider the same system, but inside a harmonic confining potential, which we call "active jellium" We obtain a parametric representation of the particle density in the stationary state at large $N$, which we analyze in detail. In the second part, we consider a non-reciprocal version of the rank interaction: the $+$ particles are attracted towards the $-$ particles (of velocity $-v_0$) with a constant force $b/N.

## 5. Domain Overlapping Algorithm with Nonlinear Mapping for   Collocation-Based Solutions of Eigenvalue Problems

**Authors:** Jinwei Yang, Vinod Srinivasan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09398v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09398v1)

**Summary:**

The proposed methods leverage the spectral accuracy of Chebyshev polynomials while overcoming limitations of existing tools like Chebfun. The one-point overlap method demonstrated significant improvements over global mapping approaches. Validation on 3D channel flow with viscosity stratification and Burgers equation highlighted the methods robustness. For instance, eigenvalue calculations for miscible core-annular flows matched prior results while resolving sharp viscosities gradients with fewer nodes. The proposed algorithms preserved smoothness up to CN continuity, critical for eigen Value problems in hydrodynamic stability and nonlinear BVPs.

## 6. The number of monotone trapezoids with prescribed bottom row

**Authors:** Ilse Fischer, Hans Höngesberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09343v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09343v1)

**Summary:**

We establish an operator formula for the number of monotone trapezoids with prescribed bottom row, generalizing alternating sign matrices. The enumeration formula is conceptually simple and applies, in addition to the newly discovered hidden operator, an operator ensuring row strictness to the formula. We also uncover an unexpected relation to the coinvariant algebra and propose a conjecture on its generalization. The result involves a free boundary, which is a novel situation in this area. It is also the first time that the top row of the monot one trapezoid is not prescribed.

## 7. The bilinear fermionic form for KP and BKP hierarchies

**Authors:** Shuai Guo, Ce Ji, Chenglang Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09302v1)

**Summary:**

For a tau-function of the KP or BKP hierarchy, we introduce the notion of lifting operator and derive an equation. This provides an effective approach to determine the fermionic two-point function of the tau. As practical applications, we derive concise formulas for the two- point functions of several models, like the $r$-spin model and the Br{\' e}zin--Gross--Witten model, which respectively serve as examples for KP and BkP t Tau-functions.

## 8. Exact physical quantities of the $D_2^{(2)}$ spin chain model with   generic open boundary conditions

**Authors:** Pengcheng Lu, Junpeng Cao, Wen-Li Yang, Ian Marquette, Yao-Zhong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09262v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the twisted $D_2^{(2)$ algebra. The Hamiltonian of this model can be factorized into the sum of two staggered XXZ spin chains. Based on these results, we analytically compute the surface energies and excitation energies of the model in different regimes of boundary parameters. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, San Diego.

## 9. Localized past stability of the subcritical Kasner-scalar field   spacetimes

**Authors:** F. Beyer, T. A. Oliynyk, W. Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the nonlinear stability, in the contracting direction, of the entire subcritical family of Kasner-scalar field solutions. We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities. Spatial localisation is achieved through our choice of zero-shift, harmonic time slicing that leads to hyperbolic evolution equations with a finite propagation speed. Our proof relies on a zero- shift, orthonormal frame decomposition of a conformal representation of the Einstein-scaled field equations.

## 10. A Jensen inequality for partial traces and applications to partially   semiclassical limits

**Authors:** Eric A. Carlen, Rupert L. Frank, Simon Larson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09160v1)

**Summary:**

We prove a matrix inequality for convex functions of a Hermitian matrix on a bipartite space. As an application we reprove and extend some theorems about eigenvalue asymptotics of Schr\"odinger operators with homogeneous potentials. The case of main interest is where the Weyl expression is infinite and a partially semiclassical limit occurs. We show that this limit is not the same as the limit where the expression is inclusive and the expression is infinite.

## 11. Oscillons from $Q$-balls

**Authors:** F. Blaschke, T. Romańczukiewicz, K. Sławińska, A. Wereszczyński

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136v1)

**Summary:**

Using Renormalization Group Theory we show that oscillons in (1+1)-dimensions can be obtained, at the leading nonlinear order, from $Q$-balls of universal complex field theories. This allows us to generalize the usual perturbative expansion by Fodor et. al. beyond the simplest unmodulated oscillon case. We explain the characteristic amplitude modulations of excited oscillons as an effect of formation of a two-Q-ball (two-oscillon) bound state.

## 12. Tail Profile of Bulk Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos Measures I:   Bulk/Boundary Quotients

**Authors:** Yichao Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09121v1)

**Summary:**

This is the first part of a series of papers devoted to studying the right tail profile of a bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure with uniform singularity on the boundary. The study of the universal tail profiles of general bulk measures and bulk/boundary quotients as well as connections to integrability results of boundary Liouville conformal field theory will be pursued in subsequent papers. The main idea is to implement the so-called localization trick at the boundary, and we also record a useful generalization of Kahane's convexity inequality.

## 13. On Zero Energy States in SUSY Quantum Mechanics on Manifolds

**Authors:** Ivan G. Avramidi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09040v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09040v1)

**Summary:**

We study the zero modes of the operator $H_f=D^*_fD_f$ acting on the spinor bundle over a closed even dimensional Riemannian manifold $M. We obtain sufficient conditions on the deformation function that guarantee the positivity of the operators. We also show that these conditions are not necessary and provide an explicit counterexample of a zero mode of $H-f$ We conclude by showing that $D-f' is a Dirac type operator with zero modes.

## 14. Gaussian Waves and Edge Eigenvectors of Random Regular Graphs

**Authors:** Yukun He, Jiaoyang Huang, Horng-Tzer Yau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08897v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08897v1)

**Summary:**

Backhausz and Szegedy (2019) demonstrated that the almost eigenvectors of random regular graphs converge to Gaussian waves. In this paper, we present an alternative proof of this result. We establish that the variance must be $\sigma^2=1$. Furthermore, we show that the eigenvalues and eigenevectors are asymptotically independent. Our approach introduces a simple framework linking the weak convergence of the imaginary part of the Green's function to the convergence of eigenivectors, which may be of independent interest.
