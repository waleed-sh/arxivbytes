## 0. Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries

**Authors:** Yi-Jun He, Jue Hou, Yi-Chao Liu, Zi-Xi Tan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636v1)

**Summary:**

In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetry and boundary conditions.

## 1. Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from   supersymmetric gauge theory

**Authors:** Xian-Hui Ge, Masataka Matsumoto, Kilar Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627v1)

**Summary:**

The master equation of the Proca field in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by using the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal modes duality. We establish the dictionary between the parameters in gauge and gravity theories, since both sides lead to Heun-type equations. Applying the technique of instanton counting, we analytically find the eigenfrequencies of the quasinormal mode and quasi-bound states for massive vector fields around black holes. The results show consistency with known numerical researches in the literature.

## 2. Generalized determinant inspired by QCD

**Authors:** Francesco Giacosa, Michał Zakrzewski, Shahriyar Jafarzade, Robert D. Pisarski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617v1)

**Summary:**

We present a generalized determinant as a function of $N$ distinct $N \times N$ complex matrices into a complex number. This function, originally introduced in the study of the chiral anomaly in QCD, reduces to the usual determinant when all the matrices are taken as equal. We denote it as `polydeterminant' Here, we explore its main algebraic properties as well as its geometric interpretation in detail. In particular, we focus on connections to mesons.

## 3. Ontological models cannot adequately represent state update for   sequential measurement of incompatible observables

**Authors:** Alisson Tezzin, Bárbara Amaral, Jonte R. Hance

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615v1)

**Summary:**

Ontological models play a central role in current research on quantum foundations. They serve as a framework for defining classicality and constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena. In this work, we analyse the quantum state update rule in these models and argue that incompatibility is sufficient to stop them from being able to adequately represent a scenario. We also argue that classical wave theory is equally incompatible with ontological models, challenging the notion that generalized contextuality serves as a signature of classicality. The study is published in the open-access journal Theoretical Physics.

## 4. Foundational aspects of spinor structures and exotic spinors

**Authors:** J. M. Hoff da Silva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15471v1)

**Summary:**

Spacetimes may have more than one spinor structure, depending on topological properties. The spinors resulting from the extra structures are called exotic. In the sequel, we delve into the topologically corrected Dirac operator, explicitly obtaining it and exploring the physical consequences encoded in the exotic spinor dynamics. Finally, we overview early and recent achievements in the area, pointing out possible directions within this research program. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.

## 5. Bound on the Excess Charge of Generalized Thomas-Fermi-Weizsäcker   Functionals

**Authors:** Rafael D. Benguria, Heinz Siedentop

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15444v1)

**Summary:**

We bound the number of electrons $Q$ that an atom can bind in excess of neutrality for density functionals generalizing the classical Thomas-Fermi-Weizsacker functional. Instead of the classical power $5/3$ more general powers $p$ are considered. The case $p=3/2$ is critical: the behavior changes from a uniform bound in $Z$ to a linear bound at the critical coupling of the nonlinear term. We also improve the linear bound for all $p\geq6/5$.

## 6. Numerical and graphical exploration of the generalized beta-logarithmic   matrix function and its properties

**Authors:** Nabiullah Khan, Rakibul Sk, Mehbub Hassan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15415v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the generalized beta-logarithmic matrix function (GBLMF) The study establishes essential properties of this function, including functional relations, inequalities, finite and infinite sums, integral representations, and partial derivative formulas. Theoretical results are accompanied by numerical examples and graphical representations to demonstrate the behavior of the new matrix function. A comparison with classical and previously studied beta matrix functions is presented to highlight the differences and advantages of the generalized version. The findings offer valuable insights into the properties and applications of the extended beta- logarithmic matrix function in various mathematical and applied contexts.

## 7. Mixed Berndt-Type Integrals and Generalized Barnes Multiple Zeta   Functions

**Authors:** JiaNing Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15173v1)

**Summary:**

Mixed Berndt-type integrals contain (hyperbolic) sine and cosine functions in the integrand function. By contour integration, these integrals are first converted to some hyperbolic (infinite) sums of Ramanujan type. All of these can be calculated in closed forms by comparing both the Fourier series expansions and the Maclaurin series expansions of a few Jacobi elliptic functions. We also present some interesting consequences and illustrative examples.

## 8. Emergence of coupled Korteweg-de Vries equations in $m$ fields

**Authors:** Sharath Jose, Manas Kulkarni, Vishal Vasan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15159v1)

**Summary:**

The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is of fundamental importance in a wide range of subjects. We present a general framework in which a family of multi-component KdV (mKDV) equations naturally arises from a broader mathematical structure under reasonable assumptions on the nature of the nonlinear couplings. We show that physically relevant setups such as $N\geq m+1$ multi- component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (MNLS) reduce to such an equation for a specific choice of the symmetric functions.
