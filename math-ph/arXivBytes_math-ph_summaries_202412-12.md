## Primitive asymptotics in $φ^4$ vector theory

**Authors:** Paul-Hermann Balduf, Johannes Thürigen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08617v1)

**Summary:**

A longstanding conjecture in QFT is that primitive graphs dominate the beta function asymptotically at large loop order in the minimal-subtraction scheme. Here we investigate this issue by exploiting additional combinatorial structure coming from an extension to vectors with $O(N)$ symmetry. We find that the leadingAsymptotic growth rate becomes visible only above $approx 25$ loops, while data at lower order is suggestive of a wrong asymPTotics. We give bounds on the degree in $N$ for primitive and non-primitive graphs, and construct the primitive graphs of highest degree explicitly.

## Minimizing sequences of Sobolev inequalities revisited

**Authors:** Charlotte Dietze, Phan Thành Nam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08616v1)

**Summary:**

We give a new proof of the compactness of minimizing sequences of the Sobolev inequalities in the critical case. Our approach relies on a simplified version of the concentration-compactness principle, which does not require any refinement of the Sobolev embedding theory. We present our proof in a paper published in the Journal of Computer Science and Engineering. The article is based on a study published by the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2010. The author's title is the ‘Concentration-Compactness Principle in the Critical Case’

## Invariant Stability Conditions on Certain Calabi-Yau Threefolds

**Authors:** Tom Bridgeland, Fabrizio Del Monte, Luca Giovenzana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08531v1)

**Summary:**

We apply results on inducing stability conditions to local Calabi-Yau threefolds and obtain applications to Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory. We use a result of Dell to construct stability conditions on the derived category of $X$ for which all stable objects can be explicitly described. These stability conditions were first discussed in the physics literature by Closset and del Zotto, and were constructed mathematically by Xiong by a different method. We conclude that they define analytic wall-crossing structures in the sense of Kontsevich and Soibelman.

## Gromov ground state in phase space engineering for fusion energy

**Authors:** Hong Qin, Elijah J. Kolmes, Michael Updike, Nicholas Bohlsen, Nathaniel J. Fisch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08494v1)

**Summary:**

 phase space engineering by RF waves plays important roles in both thermal D-T fusion and non-thermal advanced fuel fusion. But not all phase space manipulation is allowed, certain fundamental limits exist. The challenge question is: What is the Gromov ground state, i.e., the lowest energy state accessible by smooth symplectic maps? This is a difficult problem. As a simplification, we conjecture that the linear GromOV ground state problem is solvable. We show how to manipulate phase space using RF waves.

## Koopman Theory-Inspired Method for Learning Time Advancement Operators   in Unstable Flame Front Evolution

**Authors:** Rixin Yu, Marco Herbert, Markus Klein, Erdzan Hodzic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08426v1)

**Summary:**

Predicting the evolution of complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging, especially for nonlinear, chaotic behaviors. This study introduces Koopman-inspired Fourier Neural Operators (kFNO) and Convolutional Neural Networks (kCNN) to learn solution advancement operators for flame front instabilities. By transforming data into a high-dimensional latent space, these models achieve more accurate multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods. Benchmarking across one- and two-dimensional flame front scenarios demonstrates the proposed approaches' superior performance in short-term accuracy.

## A new class of semiclassical gravity solutions, gravitational quantum   stealths and regular Cauchy horizons

**Authors:** Benito A. Juárez-Aubry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402v1)

**Summary:**

We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the system is quasi-linear hyperbolic. If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship. We provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassicals gravity without spacetime symmetries.

## Generalized pentagram maps via Q-nets and refactorization mappings

**Authors:** Bao Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08202v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a family of generalizations of the pentagram maps related to $Q$-nets. We find the map can be treated as a refactorization mapping in the Poisson-Lie group of pseudo-difference operators. Using this description, we obtain the corresponding Lax form with a spectral parameter and invariant Poisson brackets. Finally, we consider the reduction to $B$- nets and the discrete BKP equation, offering a geometric explanation for the discrete-time Toda equation.

## States and IR divergences in factorization algebras

**Authors:** Masashi Kawahira, Tomohiro Shigemura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08183v1)

**Summary:**

In factorization algebras, we often use a natural augmentation state. In physics, we use a state given by compactification of spacetime. At first glance, the relation between these three states is not so clear. In this paper, propose a definition of compactification method in factorizationAlgebraes and give a way to treat IR divergences in massless theory. As a result, we see the three sates are equivalent both in massive theory and massless Theory.

## The spectral Einstein functional for the Dirac operator with torsion

**Authors:** Jin Hong, Yong Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08028v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08028v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we compute the spectral Einstein functional associated with the Dirac operator with torsion on even-dimensional spin manifolds without boundary. We also show that this functional can be used to calculate the Einstein functional for a Dirac-like Dirac equation. We conclude that the Einstein-Dirac equation can be written in terms of an Einstein- Dirac  equation with a torsionsion. We then use this equation to solve the Einstein equation for Dirac's Dirac function.

## Geometric Deformation of Quantum Mechanics

**Authors:** Ivan G. Avramidi, Roberto Niardi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08007v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a novel approach to Quantum Mechanics that we call Curved Quantum Mechanics. In this approach, a state of a quantum system is described by a point in the cotangent bundle of the state manifold. We show that in the case of negative curvature there is a bifurcation at a critical value of the curvature. This means that for small mass all modes are in the quantum regime with the unitary periodic dynamics. For large mass there are classical modes, with not a periodic but rather an exponential time evolution leading to a collapse.
