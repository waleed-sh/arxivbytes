## 0. Limits on dark matter, ultralight scalars, and cosmic neutrinos with   gyroscope spin and precision clocks

**Authors:** Sara Rufrano Aliberti, Gaetano Lambiase, Tanmay Kumar Poddar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09575v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09575v1)

**Summary:**

Dark matter (DM) within the solar system induces deviations in the geodetic drift of gyroscope spin due to its gravitational interaction. We constrain DM overdensity within the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) orbit and project limits for Earth's and Neptune's orbits around the Sun. The presence of electrons in gravitating sources and test objects introduces a scalar-mediated Yukawa potential, which can be probed using terrestrial and space--based precision clocks. These precision measurements offer a robust framework for testing gravity at solar system scales.

## 1. A glitch in gravity: cosmic Lorentz-violation from fiery Big Bang to   glacial heat death

**Authors:** Robin Y. Wen, Lukas T. Hergt, Niayesh Afshordi, Douglas Scott

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09568v1)

**Summary:**

One regime where we might see departures from general relativity is at the largest accessible scales. We investigate a single-parameter extension to the standard cosmological model with a different strength of gravity above and below this scale. Cosmic microwave background observations, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (including the recent DESI Y1) favour weaker superhorizon gravity, at nearly a percent (or 2$\sigma$ level) This compounds evidence for an even stronger glitch during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

## 2. Black Mirrors: CPT-Symmetric Alternatives to Black Holes

**Authors:** Kostas Tzanavaris, Latham Boyle, Neil Turok

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09558v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein's equations imply that a gravitationally collapsed object forms an event horizon. But what lies on the other side of this horizon? In this paper, we question the reality of the conventional solution (the black hole) and point out another, topologically distinct solution: the black mirror. In the black hole solution, the horizon connects the exterior metric to an interior metric which contains a curvature singularity. We give the general stationary (charged, rotating) black mirror solution explicitly, and describe the general black mirror formed by gravitational collapse.

## 3. Discretely self-similar exterior-naked singularities for the   Einstein-scalar field system

**Authors:** Serban Cicortas, Christoph Kehle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09540v1)

**Summary:**

The problem of constructing naked singularities in general relativity can be naturally divided into two parts: (i) the construction of the region exterior to the past light cone of the singularity, and (ii) attaching an interior fill-in. This problem has been resolved for the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system by Christodoulou, but his construction, based on a continuously self-similar ansatz, requires that both the exterior and the interior regions are mildly irregular on the past cone. On the other hand, numerical works suggest that there exist naked singularity spacetimes with discreteself-similarity arising from smooth initial data.

## 4. Les Houches lectures on two-dimensional gravity and holography

**Authors:** Gustavo J. Turiaci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09537v1)

**Summary:**

Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.

## 5. The Interconnection of Cosmological Constant and Renyi Entropy in   Kalb-Ramond Black Holes : Insights from Thermodynamic Topology

**Authors:** Bidyut Hazarika, Mozib Bin Awal, Prabwal Phukon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09494v1)

**Summary:**

This paper seeks to establish a connection between the cosmological constant and Renyi entropy within the framework of Kalb-Raymond(K-R) gravity. Our analysis is supported by evidence showing the equivalence of the thermodynamic topology of K-R AdS black holes in the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical framework. We derive an approximate relationship between the Renyi parameter and the cosMological constant, which is consistent with similar findings in the literature from acosmological perspective.

## 6. Gravitational ABJ Anomaly, Stochastic Matter Production, and   Leptogenesis

**Authors:** Azadeh Maleknejad

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09490v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational ABJ anomaly links the chirality of the gravitational field to the chiral fermions, resulting in the stochastic generation of fermionic matter in the radiation era. We show that this mechanism can account for the entire dark matter relic density and discuss its potential as a leptogenesis scenario to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Remarkably, this letter reveals that even if gravitational waves become unpolarized later, their temporaryChirality during their generation process leaves a lasting imprint on the fermion matter.

## 7. Long-lived quasinormal modes and asymptotic tails of regular   Schwarzschild-like black holes in the presence of a magnetic field

**Authors:** Akbar Davlataliev, Bakhtiyor Narzilloev, Ibrar Hussain, Ahmadjon Abdujabbarov, Bobomurat Ahmedov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09464v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the evolution of perturbations of a (charged) massive scalar field near a regular Simpson-Visser black hole. We show that the damping rate of the quasinormal frequencies is strongly suppressed by both the magnetic field and the mass term. There are indications that arbitrarily long-lived modes, or quasi-resonances, may exist in the spectrum. For nonzero multipole and azimuthal numbers, the power-law envelope characteristic of cases without a magnetic field transforms into an oscillatory envelope that cannot be easily fitted with a simple formula.

## 8. Constraints on Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology from Advanced LIGO and Advanced   Virgo's First Three Observing Runs

**Authors:** Qin Tan, Zu Cheng Chen, You Wu, Lang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09461v1)

**Summary:**

PBB cosmology proposes an alternative to cosmic inflation where the Universe evolves from a weak-coupling, low-curvature state to the hot Big Bang. We search for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) predicted by pre-big-bang (PBB) cosmology using data from the first three observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We find no evidence for a PBB-induced SGWB, with a Bayes factor of $0.03$ between the PBB and noise-only model.

## 9. de Sitter Excited State in Heterotic E_8 x E_8 Theory

**Authors:** Suddhasattwa Brahma, Keshav Dasgupta, Bohdan Kulinich, Archana Maji, P. Ramadevi, Radu Tatar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09449v1)

**Summary:**

We devise a novel duality sequence to study late-time cosmology. We find that the dimensionally reduced four-dimensional theory does not violate NEC. We do not see either a bouncing or an ekpyrotic phase. Instead, our setup shows a transient de Sitter phase that lies well within the trans-Planckian bound. This opens up a myriad of possibilities of addressing both phenomenological and cosmological issues. We concentrate on one such interesting model, an axionic cosmology with temporally varying axionic coupling.

## 10. Backreaction inclusive Schwinger effect

**Authors:** Shagun Kaushal, Suprit Singh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09436v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09436v1)

**Summary:**

We employ a self-consistent framework to study the backreaction effects of particle creation in coupled semiclassical dynamics of a quantum complex scalar field and a classical electric field. We study the time-dependent particle content, current density, and electric field, and describe how they capture the time evolution of the quantized field modes. We then compare the results with and without backre reaction in flat and cosmological de Sitter spacetime, finding that the Backreaction significantly alters particle production in both cases.

## 11. Modified gravity/Dynamical Dark Energy vs $Λ$CDM: is the game   over?

**Authors:** Sergei D. Odintsov, Diego Sáez-Chillón Gómez, German S. Sharov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09409v1)

**Summary:**

Over the last decades, tests on the standard model of cosmology, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM model, have been widely analysed and compared with many different models for describing dark energy. Modified gravities have played an important role in this sense. Previous observational data has been always favouring $F(R) model in comparison to any other model. Results of this analysis suggest that standard exponential $F (R) models provide much better fits than the $Lamb da$ CDM model.

## 12. Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark   Matter Admixed Neutron Stars

**Authors:** Francesco Grippa, Gaetano Lambiase, Tanmay Kumar Poddar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09381v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09381v1)

**Summary:**

Neutron Stars (NSs) are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We review how DM can modify cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.

## 13. Quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in shift-symmetric   Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory

**Authors:** Fech Scen Khoo, Jose Luis Blázquez-Salcedo, Burkhard Kleihaus, Jutta Kunz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09377v1)

**Summary:**

Quasinormal modes were recently obtained by employing perturbation theory in quadratic order in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Here we present the full non-perturbative results for the spectrum within the domain of existence of rotating black holes. We also compare with the quasinormal mode spectrum of rapidly rotating Einstein-dilaton-Gauss- Bonnet black holes and compare them with the perturbative result. We employ a recently developed spectral method to obtain the spectrum.

## 14. Propagating degrees of freedom on maximally-symmetric backgrounds in   $f(R)$ theories of gravity

**Authors:** Adrián Casado-Turrión, Álvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz, Antonio Dobado

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09366v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of $f(R)$ gravity, as well as other extended theories of gravity, the correct counting of globally well-defined dynamical modes has recently drawn a vivid interest. In this communication we present a consistent approach shedding light on such issues for both so-called degenerate and non-degenerate models. We find that the linearised spectrum of degenerate models on these backgrounds is empty, lacking both the graviton and scalaron modes which appear in generic non- Degenerated models.

## 15. Is cosmological data suggesting a nonminimal coupling between matter and   gravity?

**Authors:** Miguel Barroso Varela, Orfeu Bertolami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09348v1)

**Summary:**

Theoretical predictions from a modified theory of gravity are compared to data from recent cosmological surveys. We find moderate to strong evidence for a preference of the nonminimally coupled theory over the current standard model for all dataset combinations. Although the modified model is shown to be capable of matching early-time observations from the cosmic microwave background and late-time supernovae data, we find that there is still some incoherence with respect to the conclusions drawn from baryon acoustic oscillation observations.

## 16. Electromagnetic radiation from a relativistic jet induced by a plane   gravitational wave

**Authors:** Vladimir Epp, Konstantin Osetrin, Elena Osetrina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09326v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational wave is considered as a weak (linearized) field on flat Minkowski spacetime. It is assumed that the relativistic jet has large regions with uncompensated electric charge. The deformation of these areas under the action of a gravitational wave leads to the appearance of electric currents that generate electromagnetic radiation. The angular distribution of the intensity of this radiation is found. Cases are considered when the jet and the gravitational wave move in the same direction or towards each other..

## 17. Properties of interacting quark star in light of Rastall gravity

**Authors:** Ayan Banerjee, Anirudh Pradhan, Izzet Sakalli, Archana Dixit

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09306v1)

**Summary:**

This study explores the properties of quark stars (QS) formulated with an interacting quark matter equation of state (EoS) within the framework of Rastall gravity, a modified theory of gravity. We derive the mass-radius relationships and calculate the maximum gravitational masses and their corresponding radii. We also assess the stability of these quarks stars by evaluating their static stability, adiabatic index, and sound velocity profiles. This confirms their viability within the modified gravitational framework.

## 18. Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT

**Authors:** Chen Yang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09297v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter. They have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}-10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter, say the authors. They use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBH's within the massrange of £10^{16}-£18$ g.

## 19. An approach to quasinormal modes of black hole based on reversed   harmonic oscillator dynamics

**Authors:** Shigefumi Naka, Haruki Toyoda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09274v1)

**Summary:**

The frequencies of quasinormal modes (QNM) for the Schwartzschild black hole are studied from the viewpoint of the particle scattering under an effective Regge-Wheeler type of potential. Under this setting, the transmission and reflection coefficients are studied in addition to the frequencies of QNMs. In particular, we use the eigenstates for a reversed harmonic oscillator as the complete bases in this intermediate region. We also use a parabolic type one in an intermediate region and flat potentials on both sides.

## 20. Wormhole geometries in modified gravity

**Authors:** Nailya Ganiyeva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09228v1)

**Summary:**

In this thesis, we investigate traversable wormhole spacetimes within the context of a covariant generalization of Einstein's General Relativity. We demonstrate the existence of numerous wormhole solutions, wherein the matter fields satisfy all energy conditions. Remarkably, these solutions do not require fine-tuning of the free parameters inherent to the model. One limitation is that these solutions lack natural localization, necessitating then a matching with an external vacuum spacetime. To address this, we derive the junction conditions for the theory, establishing that any matching between two spacetime must be smooth.

## 21. DeWitt wave functions for de Sitter JT gravity

**Authors:** Wilfried Buchmuller, Arthur Hebecker, Alexander Westphal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09211v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09211v1)

**Summary:**

Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an intriguing model for cosmological wave functions of the universe. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Projection to expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.

## 22. On M87$^*$ and SgrA$^*$ Observational Constraints of Dunkl Black Holes

**Authors:** N. Askour, A. Belhaj, L. Chakhchi, H. El Moumni, K. Masmar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09196v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09196v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate the optical properties of a new black hole recently obtained from the Dunkl operator formalism involving a relevant parameter. We provide strong constraints on the parameter via the falsification mechanism.   Exploiting the M87$^*$ and SgrA$*$ optical bonds, we provide strong constraint on theparameter. We examine the effect of this parameter on the Dunk l hole deflection angle in vacuum and medium backgrounds by manipulating the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

## 23. Barrow holographic dark energy: a path to reconstructing $f(R,T)$   gravity

**Authors:** P. S. Ens, A. F. Santos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09189v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09189v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates one of the established methods for reconstructing modified gravity models from a dark energy model. We focus on the $f(R,T)$ modified gravity theory, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T$ represents the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The numerical results are subsequently presented for various infrared cutoffs, such as the Hubble horizon, future event horizon, and Granda-Oliveros cutoff. We employ Barrow's holographic darkEnergy model, derived from fractal surfaces of black holes.

## 24. Frolov Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence -- II: Quasinormal modes   and Chaos Bound

**Authors:** Mrinnoy M. Gohain, Kalyan Bhuyan, Hari Prasad Saikia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09143v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the quasinormal modes and chaotic phenomena associated with the Frolov black hole in the presence of a quintessence field. We also examined the chaos bound of circular photon orbits and observed that it violates for lower photon orbit radii and larger angular momentum values. These violation in the strong-field regime implies the onset of chaotic behaviour in the vicinity of the BHs and signify the importance of the quintessences field in photon geodesics. The obtained results on the QNM shows that increasing the magnitude of the Quintessence parameter causes the scalar perturbations to decay at a slower rate.

## 25. Interacting dark energy models

**Authors:** Robert Rugg, Shambel Sahlu, Amare Abebe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09024v1)

**Summary:**

This work focuses on two linear interaction models between dark matter and dark energy, which are proposed as key factors in explaining cosmic history. Both models are constrained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) using different sets of observational data. The constrained results are used to revisit the coincidence problem and other problems in standard cosmology. The analysis provided a discrepancy between the different data sets with one having a large error margin. The pantheon data set however predicted a reverse interaction for both models which does not follow initial assumptions that were made.

## 26. Intrinsic Torsion, Extrinsic Torsion, and the Hubble Parameter

**Authors:** Brett McInnes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08990v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08990v1)

**Summary:**

We study the intrinsic and extrinsic torsions of the spatial sections of torsional spacetimes. We consider two possibilities. First, that the intrinsic torsion might prove to be directly observable. Second, that it is not observable, having been ''inflated away'' in the early Universe. We point out that, if its presence is not recognised, the Extrinsic Torsion could lead to anomalies in the theoretical estimate of the Hubble parameter, a result with obvious potential applications.

## 27. Low regularity approach to Bartnik's conjecture

**Authors:** José Luis Flores, Jónatan Herrera, Didier A. Solis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08967v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we establish a version of the Bartnik Splitting Conjecture in the context of Lorentzian length spaces. In precise terms, we show that under an appropriate timelike completeness condition, a globally hyperbolic LorentZian length space of the form $Sigma\times \mathbb{R}$ with compact splits can be considered as a metric product. This is achieved by showing that the causal boundary of that Lorent zian space consists on a single point.

## 28. Probing Spacetime Symmetries Using Gravitational Wave Ringdown

**Authors:** Rajes Ghosh, Akash K Mishra, Sudipta Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08942v1)

**Summary:**

The uniqueness and rigidity theorems assert that the asymptotically flat, vacuum, stationary rotating black hole solution in general relativity must be the Kerr solution. In our analysis of post-merger ringdown signal from coalescing black hole binary systems, we identify potential observational signatures for deviations from these Kerr symmetries. Utilizing ringdown data from the gravitational wave event GW150914, we place significant constraints on such deviations. Our analysis introduces a new and novel approach for testing spacetime symmetry through gravitational wave observations.

## 29. The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry

**Authors:** Moritz Reintjes, Blake Temple

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a natural, mathematically consistent definition of the essential (highest possible) regularity of an affine connection. This condition is based on the relative regularity between the connection and its Riemann curvature. We prove that authors' theory of the RT-equations provides a computable procedure for constructing coordinate transformations which simultaneously lift connection and curvature components to essential regularity. This provides a definitive theory for determining whether or not singularities in a geometry are essential or removable by coordinate transformation.

## 30. Scalar perturbations on the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP   brane and $σ_8$

**Authors:** Maribel Hernández Márquez, Celia Escamilla Rivera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08852v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08852v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we constrain the value of $\sigma_8$ for the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time. We solve numerically the equation for dark matter scalar perturbations using the dynamical scaling solution for the master equation. Finally, we found that the evolution of matter density perturbation in both branches is different from the $\Lambda$CDM model.

## 31. Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole

**Authors:** Parthapratim Pradhan, John W. Moffat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08844v1)

**Summary:**

It has been argued that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine the Kerr-MOG black hole and derive its form through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the black hole within the framework of modified gravity. The study also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches..

## 32. Non-minimally coupled quintessential inflation

**Authors:** Seong Chan Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08833v1)

**Summary:**

We present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses the dynamics of early-time cosmic inflation and late- time cosmic acceleration. By employing an exponential coupling function and a scalar potential with dual asymptotic plateaus, our model naturally transitions from inflationary dynamics at small field values to a quintessence-like behavior at large field values. For late-time acceleration, the model produces a viable dark energy component with an equation of state $w_\phi$ approaching $-1$ but retaining a measurable deviation that could serve as an observational signature.
