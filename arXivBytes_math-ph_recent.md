## 0. Les Houches lectures on two-dimensional gravity and holography

**Authors:** Gustavo J. Turiaci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09537v1)

**Summary:**

Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.

## 1. Regge symmetry of 6j-symbols of the Lorentz group

**Authors:** Elena Apresyan, Gor Sarkissian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09425v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we derive new symmetry and new expression for $6j$-symbols of the unitary principle series representations of the $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ group. This allowed us to derive for them the analogue of the Regge symmetry. We also show how to use this new symmetry to derive a new form of the Riemann zig-zag symmetry.

## 2. Asymptotics of Harish-Chandra transform and infinitesimal freeness

**Authors:** Alexey Bufetov, Panagiotis Zografos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09290v1)

**Summary:**

In the last ten years a technique of Schur generating functions and Harish-Chandra transforms was developed for the study of the asymptotic behavior of discrete particle systems and random matrices. In the current paper we extend this toolbox in several directions. We establish general results which allow to access not only the Law of Large Numbers, but also next terms of the  expansion of averaged empirical measures. In particular, this allows to obtain an analog of a discrete Baik-Ben Arous-Peche phase transition.

## 3. On the spectrum of the Landau Hamiltonian perturbed by a periodic   electric potential $V\in H^s_{\mathrm {loc}}({\mathbb R}^2;{\mathbb R})$, $s   > 0$

**Authors:** L. I. Danilov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09212v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that in a Sobolev space there exists a dense $G_{\delta }$-set. The spectrum of the Landau Hamiltonian $H_B + V$ perturbed by any periodic electric potential is absolutely continuous for all homogeneous magnetic fields with a rational flux. We also prove that the spectrum of a periodic function with a given period lattice is continuous in a space $H^s_{\Lambda }({\mathbb R}^2;{\mathbb O})$, $s > 0.

## 4. Towards kinetic equations of open systems of active soft matter

**Authors:** V. I. Gerasimenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09137v1)

**Summary:**

The chapter presents some new approaches to describing the collective behavior of complex systems of mathematical biology. This representation of kinetic evolution has looked to be the most direct and mathematically fully consistent formulation. An approach is also related to the challenge of a rigorous derivation of the non-Markovian kinetic equations from underlying many-entity dynamics, which makes it possible to describe the memory effects of the collectivebehavior of living creatures. The book is published by Oxford University Press and is available in hardback.

## 5. Highest weight vectors, shifted topological recursion and quantum curves

**Authors:** Raphaël Belliard, Vincent Bouchard, Reinier Kramer, Tanner Nelson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120v1)

**Summary:**

We extend the theory of topological recursion by considering Airy structures whose partition functions are highest weight vectors of particular $\mathcal{W}$-algebra representations. We show that this generalization amounts to adding specific terms to the correlators of the spectral curve. We then prove that the wave-functions constructed from this shifted version of topology recursion are WKB solutions of families of quantizations of the spectrum. In the reverse direction, starting from an $hbar$-connection, we find that a structure is topological if the exact same conditions that we found for the Airy structure are satisfied.

## 6. Generalized Liénard systems with momentum-dependent mass:   Isochronicity and bound states

**Authors:** Bijan Bagchi, A. Ghose-Choudhury, Aritra Ghosh, Partha Guha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Li\'enard equation. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states.

## 7. Boundaries of the sets of quantum realizable values of arbitrary order   Bargmann invariants

**Authors:** Lin Zhang, Bing Xie, Bo Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09070v1)

**Summary:**

Bargmann invariants have emerged as fundamental quantities in quantum information science. They uniquely characterize tuples of quantum states while remaining invariant under unitary transformations. But determining the boundaries of quantum-realizable values for Bargmann invariants of arbitrary order remains a significant theoretical challenge. This work completely solves this problem by deriving a unified boundary formulation for these values. The results enhance our understanding of the physical limits within quantum mechanics and may lead to novel applications of Bargmann  in quantum information processing.

## 8. Operator formulation of Classical mechanics: Levi-Civita map and   equivalence of central forces in 2-dimensions

**Authors:** Nikhil Kasyap Puranam, E. Harikumar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08999v1)

**Summary:**

We construct classical Hamiltonian operators and classical wavefunctions corresponding to these systems, using plane polar coordinates. Operator formulations of classical Kepler and harmonic oscillator problems in 2-dimensions are shown to be equivalent. We use Levi-Civita map and reparameterization of time(Sundman map) to solve these problems. The Schr\"{o}dinger like equation written in terms of these classical Hamiltonians is called the Schr\" dinger like equation. The equation is written as follows:

## 9. Low regularity approach to Bartnik's conjecture

**Authors:** José Luis Flores, Jónatan Herrera, Didier A. Solis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08967v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we establish a version of the Bartnik Splitting Conjecture in the context of Lorentzian length spaces. In precise terms, we show that under an appropriate timelike completeness condition, a globally hyperbolic LorentZian length space of the form $Sigma\times \mathbb{R}$ with compact splits can be considered as a metric product. This is achieved by showing that the causal boundary of that Lorent zian space consists on a single point.

## 10. Phase transition and critical behavior in hierarchical integer-valued   Gaussian and Coulomb gas models

**Authors:** Marek Biskup, Haiyu Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08964v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08964v1)

**Summary:**

We study hierarchical random fields with law proportional to the inverse temperature. Our setting includes the integer-valued Gaussian field (a.k.a. DG-model or Villain Coulomb gas) and the sine-Gordon model. Relying on renormalization group analysis we derive sharp asymptotic formulas. The field exhibits logarithmic correlations throughout albeit with a distinct $\beta$-dependence of the variance and fractional-charge exponents in the sub/supercritical regimes.

## 11. Rational RG flow, extension, and Witt class

**Authors:** Ken Kikuchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08935v1)

**Summary:**

The conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets. The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.

## 12. The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry

**Authors:** Moritz Reintjes, Blake Temple

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a natural, mathematically consistent definition of the essential (highest possible) regularity of an affine connection. This condition is based on the relative regularity between the connection and its Riemann curvature. We prove that authors' theory of the RT-equations provides a computable procedure for constructing coordinate transformations which simultaneously lift connection and curvature components to essential regularity. This provides a definitive theory for determining whether or not singularities in a geometry are essential or removable by coordinate transformation.

## 13. Formal justification of a continuum relaxation model for one-dimensional   moiré materials

**Authors:** Jingzhi, Zhou, Alexander B. Watson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08854v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08854v1)

**Summary:**

Mechanical relaxation in moir\'e materials is often modeled by a continuum model where linear elasticity is coupled to a stacking penalty. We review and compute minimizers of a one-dimensional version of this model, and then show how it can be formally derived from a natural atomistic model. We show that the continuum model emerges in the limit of the monolayer lattice constant and the typical stacking energy to the monlayer stiffness. We conclude by showing that the model can be used to predict the elasticity of a given material.

## 14. Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole

**Authors:** Parthapratim Pradhan, John W. Moffat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08844v1)

**Summary:**

It has been argued that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine the Kerr-MOG black hole and derive its form through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the black hole within the framework of modified gravity. The study also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches..
