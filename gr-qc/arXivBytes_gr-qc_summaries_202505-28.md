## 0. 5-Dimensional Gravitational Raman Scattering: Scalar Wave Perturbations   in Schwarzschild-Tangherlini Spacetime

**Authors:** Samim Akhtar, Yilber Fabian Bautista, Cristoforo Iossa, Zihan Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21489v1)

**Summary:**

In this Letter, we study scalar wave perturbations of arbitrary frequency to the 5D Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole (STBH) within general relativity. For the first time, we derive a closed formula for the5D partial wave gravitational Raman scattering amplitude applicable to a broad class of boundary conditions. We compute the dynamical and static Love numbers of the STBH by matching an effective field theory description. The matched Love numbers do not vanish and present renormalization group running behavior.

## 1. Representations of the fractional d'Alembertian and initial conditions   in fractional dynamics

**Authors:** Gianluca Calcagni, Giuseppe Nardelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21485v1)

**Summary:**

We construct representations of complex powers of the d'Alembertian operator in Lorentzian signature. We pinpoint one which is self-adjoint and suitable for classical and quantum fractional field theory. We generalize this result to a much wider class of nonlocal theories and discuss its applications to quantum gravity. Using a cleaned-up version of the diffusion method, we formulate and solve the problem of initial conditions of the classical dynamics with a standard plus a fractional d' Alecptian.

## 2. Non-minimal light-curvature couplings and black-hole imaging

**Authors:** Raúl Carballo-Rubio, Héloïse Delaporte, Astrid Eichhorn, Pedro G. S. Fernandes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21431v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21431v1)

**Summary:**

Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter. They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime. curvature to the non-Minimal coupling is of order one. We investigate which values of theNonMinimal Coupling can be robustly excluded. We work within the paradigm of lensing bands, and focusing on the $n=1$ photon ring.

## 3. Scalar field stochastic dynamics in de Sitter spacetime from exact   solutions of quantum deficient oscillators

**Authors:** Yuta Nasuda, Koki Tokeshi, Yuki Watanabe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429v1)

**Summary:**

The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactlysolvable double- well model is also presented.

## 4. Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries   in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment

**Authors:** Tomás Ferreira Chase, Diana López Nacir, Nicolás Yunes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21383v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be affected by a variety of environmental effects. If detected, these effects could inform astrophysics and cosmology. We study how gravitational waves are affected by the presence of an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled to the binary. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark- matter environments.
