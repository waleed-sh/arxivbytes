## 0. Cosmic deceptions due to peculiar motions

**Authors:** Christos G. Tsagas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04680v1)

**Summary:**

 Relative motions have long been known to mislead the unsuspecting observers to false interpretations of reality. Despite the appearances, the host universe keeps decelerating and its material content retains its conventional form. Our observers can find out that they have been deceived by their own peculiar flow, by looking for the trademark signature of relative motion in their data. This signature is nothing else but a Doppler-like anisotropy in the sky distribution of the measured deceleration parameter. The magnitude of the apparent dipole should decrease with increasing redshift.

## 1. Kerr black hole parameters and its distance from the Earth in terms of   directly measurable quantities of accretion disk

**Authors:** Mehrab Momennia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04677v1)

**Summary:**

We consider massive geodesic particles circularly orbiting the Kerr black hole in the equatorial plane and emitting frequency-shifted photons toward a distant observer. We calculate the frequency shift and redshift rapidity at the detector location. The relations presented in this article allow us to disentangle mass, spin, and distance to the black holes in the Kerr spacetime background and obtain these parameters separately. Our analytic formulae are valid on the midline and close to the line of sight and they can be directly applied to supermassive black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei.

## 2. Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model

**Authors:** Martí Berenguer, Javier Mas, Juan Santos-Suárez, Alfonso V. Ramallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04660v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation.

## 3. Star equilibrium: from BNG to TOV

**Authors:** Roberto Casadio, Octavian Micu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04632v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04632v1)

**Summary:**

We study the role of the equilibrium equation in bootstrapped Newtonian gravity (BNG) We include terms inspired by the post-Newtonian expansion of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation. We then compare (approximate) BNG solutions for homogenous stars with their Newtonian and General Relativistic exact solutions. Regardless of the additional terms from the conservation equation, BNG stars do not exhibit a Buchdahl limit.

## 5. Nonlinear coupling between magnetar QPOs

**Authors:** Pantelis Pnigouras, Samuel K. Lander

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04556v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04556v1)

**Summary:**

Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $gamma$-ray flares. QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. Using a representative triplet of modes we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic-field geometry.

## 6. Cosmological scalar perturbations in Horndeski-like gravity

**Authors:** Dani de Boe, Fabiano F. Santos, Jackson Levi Said

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04524v1)

**Summary:**

Scalar-tensor theories are promising dark energy models. Horndeski-like gravity takes into account two dilaton fields. The gravitational slip (minus one) to entropy ratio is also considered as a possible replacement for the usual shear viscosity to entropy Ratio for black holes. The entropy coming from particle production $S_{in}$ and that of the apparent horizon $S$ will be studied, which translates into entropy bounds. This work is published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 7. Gravitational lensing and shadows in the toron solution of Einstein's   equations using ray tracing methods

**Authors:** Eddy B. de Leon. C. Klein, D. Korotkin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04509v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04509v1)

**Summary:**

We present a numerical and analytical study of the so-called `toron' solution of the stationary axisymmetric Einstein equations in vacuum. The asymptotic behavior of this solution coincides with the one of the NUT solution. The physical properties of this spacetime are studied via ray tracing. The results are compared to known geodesic flows in Schwarzschild, Kerr and NUT spacetimes to discuss similarities and differences, with a particular emphasis on the comparison of NUT and toron spacetime.

## 8. Eccentricity Effects on Modeling Dynamic Quantities and Their   Correlations in Binary Black Hole Mergers

**Authors:** Hao Wang, Yuan Chuan Zou, Qing Wen Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04495v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we revisit the oscillatory behavior of radiative quantities-energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum-linked with initial eccentricities in binary black hole (BBH) mergers. By varying the mean anomaly $l_0$ across the parameter range $[0,2\pi]$ from a post-Newtonian perspective, we establish an envelope that encapsulates the oscillations of these quantities. We discuss the extension of this eccentricity effect to spin alignment and spin precession configurations of BBHs.

## 9. Thermodynamic Stability of Schwarzschild-de Sitter Black holes with   Rényi entropy

**Authors:** Thanawat Anusonthi, Pitayuth Wongjun, Ratchaphat Nakarachinda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04378v1)

**Summary:**

Black holes can be treated as a thermodynamic object when quantum effect is taken into account. By using Gibbs-Boltzmann entropy, thermodynamic system associated Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole is unstable. According to R\'enyi entropy, the thermodynamic phase space needed to be extended. We found that it is possible to obtain the stability of the black hole under the process with fixing pressure, temperature and number of particles. We also found that there exist the phase transitions from the hot gas to the stable black hole in such the process. Therefore, the non-extensive effect of R\'enii statistics may provide a physical insight beyond the standard approach to black hole thermodynamics.

## 10. Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations around the   Schwarzschild MOG black hole

**Authors:** Oreeda Shabbir, Mubasher Jamil Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04367v1)

**Summary:**

This article explores the motion of massive particles in the gravitational field of a modified gravity (MOG) black hole (BH) Using the Hamiltonian formalism, the geodesic equations and the effective potential governing particle trajectories are derived. Numerical methods are employed to compute periodic orbits in this spacetime, with a comparison drawn to the Schwarzschild BH. The findings indicate that for $\alpha>0$, periodic orbits around Schwarzschild-MOG BH exhibit lower energy requirements than those in Schwarzschild spacetime.

## 11. Corrections to the Black hole entropy from a Bose Einstein condensate: a   semi-classical phenomenological approach

**Authors:** Stefano Viaggiu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy. Motivated by our recent proposal concerning the nature of the degrees of freedom. We show that after modifying the internal energy by means of simple by physically sound arguments dictated by ordinary quantum mechanics and possible non-commutative effects at Planckian scales. Our approach show that the possibility that the interior of a black hole is composed with a Bose Einstein condensate of gravitons is a viable physically motivated possibility.

## 12. The effective phase space and $e$-folding of the Starobinsky and   extended Starobinsky model of inflation

**Authors:** Theppawan Rukpakawong, Piyabut Burikham

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04334v1)

**Summary:**

Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky inflationary model show three apparent attractors; the fixed angle attractor in the large field limit, the final attractor representing reheating phase in the small field region, and the apparent attractor corresponding to the slow-roll condition connecting between the large-field and small-field region. To consider the total $e$-folding likelihood of the model, Remmen-Carroll conserved measure is constructed and normalized. Using the measure, the total e- folding number $N$ and its expectation value $N \right\rangle$ are calculated.
