## 0. Quantum Area Fluctuations from Gravitational Phase Space

**Authors:** Luca Ciambelli, Temple He, Kathryn M. Zurek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12282v1)

**Summary:**

We study the gravitational phase space associated to a stretched horizon within a finite-sized causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional spacetimes. By imposing the Raychaudhuri equation, we obtain its constrained symplectic form using the covariant phase space formalism. We compute the area fluctuations of the causal diamond by taking a Carrollian limit of the stretched horizon in pure Minkowski spacetime. We show that the variance of the area fluctuation is proportional to the area itself.

## 1. Wormholes with Ends of the World

**Authors:** Diandian Wang, Zhencheng Wang, Zixia Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12278v1)

**Summary:**

We study classical wormhole solutions in 3D gravity with end-of-the-world branes, conical defects, kinks, and punctures. These solutions compute statistical averages of an ensemble of boundary conformal field theories. We provide evidence for a correspondence between the gravity theory and the ensemble. In particular, the agreement of $g$-function dependence results from an underlying topological aspect of the on-shell EOW brane action, from which a BCFT analogue of the Schlenker-Witten theorem also follows.

## 2. Sound waves from primordial black hole formations

**Authors:** Zhuan Ning, Xiang-Xi Zeng, Zi-Yan Yuwen, Shao-Jiang Wang, Heling Deng, Rong-Gen Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12243v1)

**Summary:**

We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures ofPBHs in the gravitational wave spectrum.

## 3. Suppression of composition g-modes in chemically-equilibrating warm   neutron stars

**Authors:** Tianqi Zhao, Peter B. Rau, Alexander Haber, Steven P. Harris, Constantinos Constantinou, Sophia Han

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12230v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12230v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures up to T~5 MeV. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscoity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state.

## 4. Barrow and Tsallis entropies after the DESI DR2 BAO data

**Authors:** Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12205v1)

**Summary:**

Modified cosmology based on Barrow entropy arises from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. We use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) to extract constraints on such scenarios. The best-fit value for the Barrow exponent $Delta$ is found to be negative, while the zero value is allowed only in the range of $2\sigma $ for three out of four datasets.

## 5. Towards asteroseismology of neutron stars with physics-informed neural   networks

**Authors:** Dimitra Tseneklidou, Alejandro Torres-Forne, Pablo Cerda-Duran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12183v1)

**Summary:**

The study of the gravitational wave signatures of neutron star oscillations may provide important information of their interior structure and Equation of State (EoS) at high densities. We present a novel technique based on physically informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the eigenvalue problem associated with normal oscillation modes of neutron stars. The flexibility of the method and its capability of adapting to complex scenarios may serve in the future as a path to include more physics into these systems. The procedure is tested in a simplified scenario, with an analytical solution, that can be used to test the performance and the accuracy of the system.

## 6. Can asteroid-mass PBHDM be compatible with catalyzed phase transition   interpretation of PTA?

**Authors:** Jiahang Zhong, Chao Chen, Yi-Fu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12105v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW) signals from PTs. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of this catalytic effect during supercooled PTs within the high PBH number density regime. We find that at relatively small PBH. number densities, the GW signals are amplified due to the large-size bubbles. While higher PBH numbers suppress GW signals, since the accelerated PT progresses too rapidly.

## 7. Observational properties of regular black holes in Asymptotic Safety

**Authors:** Abdybek Urmanov, Hrishikesh Chakrabarty, Daniele Malafarina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12072v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the observational properties of a spherically symmetric, static regular black hole within the framework of asymptotic safety (AS) The metric resembles the Schwarzschild solution in the classical limit. The departure from Schwarzschild at small scales is controlled by a single free parameter related to the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff of the theory. We found that the radiation flux, luminosity, and efficiency of the accretion disk increase with the value of the free parameter. Using a spacetime generic open-source relativistic ray-tracing code we simulate the K$\alpha$ iron line profiles emitted by the disk.

## 8. Diverse regular spacetimes using a parametrised density profile

**Authors:** Anjan Kar, Sayan Kar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12042v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the construction of diverse regular spacetimes (black holes and defects) in General Relativity. Our solutions, in the Schwarzschild gauge, include new regular black holes as well as non-singular solutions representing spacetime defects. We also provide possible Lagrangian density constructions for the matter energy-momentum tensors. Finally, we present a model for a stable star (a gravastar) by explicit use of the junction conditions and obtain relevant consequences highlighting its characteristic features.

## 9. Area spectrum and black hole thermodynamics

**Authors:** Arpita Jana, Manjari Dutta, Sunandan Gangopadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12014v1)

**Summary:**

The role of horizon area quantization on black hole thermodynamics is investigated in this article. The coefficient appearing in the quantization of area is fixed by an appeal to the saturated form of the Landauer's principle. The change in mass is then equated to the product of the Hawking temperature and change in entropy of the black hole between two consecutive discrete states. This gives the corrected Hawking temperature. In particular, we apply this technique to the Schwarzschild black hole, the quantum corrected Schwarzschild Black Hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole and the rotating Kerr black hole geometry.

## 10. Hawking evaporation and the fate of black holes in loop quantum gravity

**Authors:** Idrus Husin Belfaqih, Martin Bojowald, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Erick I. Duque

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11998v1)

**Summary:**

New framework makes it possible to couple scalar matter to such LQG black holes and derive Hawking radiation. Quantum-geometry effects enter the thermal distribution only through sub-leading corrections in the greybody factors. They do impact energy emission of the black hole and its final state in a crucial way regarding one of the main questions of black-hole evaporation. For the first time, a first-principles derivation, based on a discussion of backreaction, finds evidence that points to the former outcome.

## 11. Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for   Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence

**Authors:** Hing-Tong Cho, Bei-Lok Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11991v1)

**Summary:**

A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum Stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies.

## 12. Probing the cold nature of dark matter

**Authors:** Weiqiang Yang, Supriya Pan, Eleonora Di Valentino, Olga Mena, David F. Mota, Subenoy Chakraborty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11973v1)

**Summary:**

There are indications that cold dark matter may encounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly at galactic scales. A pressureless dark matter component fits well with several cosmological observations. This study suggests that models incorporating a non-cold dark matter part should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological implications, as reflected in the present work. It also suggests that when the dark energy equation of state lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated.

## 13. Spinorial quasilocal mass for spacetimes with negative cosmological   constant

**Authors:** Virinchi Rallabhandi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11971v1)

**Summary:**

A new notion of quasilocal mass is defined for generic, compact, two dimensional, spacelike surfaces in four dimensional spacetimes with negative cosmological constant. This mass is non-negative, equal to the Misner-Sharp mass in spherical symmetry. It has an appropriate form for gravity linearised about AdS and has a limit for large spheres in asymptotically AdS spacetime. The definition is spinorial and based on work for vanishing cosmologically constant by Penrose and Dougan & Mason.

## 14. The Conserved Effective Stress Tensor of Gravitational Wave

**Authors:** Yang Zhang, Xuan Ye

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11956v1)

**Summary:**

We present a detailed study of the effective stress tensor of gravitational wave (GW) as the source for the background Einstein equation. The second order perturbed Einstein tensor has long been known to be covariantly nonconserved with respect to the background spacetime. We find that, by expressing it in terms of the perturbed Hilbert-Einstein actions,   the non Conserved part of $G^{(2)$ is actually canceled out by the pert disturbed fluid stress tensors in the back-reaction equation.

## 15. Revisiting Unimodular Quantum Cosmology

**Authors:** Júlio C. Fabris, Luiz Filipe Guimarães, Nelson Pinto-Neto, Mahamadou Hamani Daouda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11955v1)

**Summary:**

The quantization of unimodular gravity in minisuperspace leads to a time evolution of states generated by the Hamiltonian, as in usual quantum mechanics. The behavior of the scale factor presents a bounce followed by a de Sitter expansion, reproducing the quantum cosmological scenario in General Relativity. The analysis is extended to the Brans-Dicke scalar tensor theory. It is argued that only in this case a non-trivial evolution for the scalar field can be obtained.

## 16. Assessing WGC Compatibility in ModMax Black Holes via Photon Spheres   Analysis and WCCC Validation

**Authors:** Saeed Noori Gashti, Mohammad Ali S. Afshar, Mohammad Reza Alipour, Izzet Sakallı, Behnam Pourhassan, Jafar Sadeghi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11939v1)

**Summary:**

The regime of Hawking radiation and evaporation ultimately drives charged black holes toward super-extremality of the charge parameter. This progression, in turn, lays the groundwork for satisfying the necessary conditions for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) Preliminary studies indicate that black holes such as the Reissner-Nordstr$\"o$m (RN) model, in their initial form, lack the capacity to sustain super- Extremality. If such conditions arise, these black holes transition into naked singularities.

## 17. Separate universe in multifield inflation: a phase-space approach

**Authors:** Julien Grain, Hugo Holland

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11929v1)

**Summary:**

The separate-universe approach consists in describing the universe as a collection of homogeneous and isotropic patches. This gives us an effective description of perturbation theory at large scales through phase-space reduction. This approximation is a necessary step in stochastic inflation, an effective theory of coarse-grained, super-Hubble, scalar fields fluctuations. One needs a stochastics inflation description in the context of primordial black hole productions since it needs enhancements of the curvature power spectrum.

## 18. Nonlinearly self-interacting extended bodies move as test bodies in   effective external fields

**Authors:** Abraham I. Harte, Francisco M. Blanco, Eanna E. Flanagan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11912v1)

**Summary:**

Previous work has shown that the laws of motion which govern compact, self-interacting bodies can be obtained by applying "Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions" These prescriptions replace any field which appears in a test-body law of motion with a certain effective field which is a quasilocal functional of the physical variables. We generalize these results, presenting a formalism which allows Detweiler's prescriptions to be be directly derived for extended bodies, even in nonlinear field theories. Although our main focus is on bodies coupled to nonlinear scalar fields, we also remark on the gravitational case.

## 19. Deflection of Light due to Kerr Sen Black Hole in Heterotic String   Theory using Material Medium Approach

**Authors:** Saswati Roy, Shubham Kala, Atanu Singha, Hemwati Nandan, A. K. Sen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11909v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11909v1)

**Summary:**

The deflection of light in the gravitational field of a massive body can be analyzed through diverse theoretical approaches. The null geodesic approach is commonly employed to calculate light deflection within strong and weak field limits. The frame-dragging effects inherent to the Kerr-Sen geometry are incorporated to compute the velocity of light rays, enabling the derivation of the refractive index in this field. The study compares our results with those obtained for the Kerr and Schwarzschild black hole solution in GR.

## 20. Semiclassical causal geodesics: Minkowski spacetime case

**Authors:** Adam Cieślik, Andrzej Góźdź, Patryk Mach, Aleksandra Pȩdrak, Włodzimierz Piechocki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11828v1)

**Summary:**

The work is a sequel to a previous paper, devoted to mathematical aspects of our model. We use an integral quantization model based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group to describe the motion of a spinless particle in the Minkowski background spacetime. We design our model in a way which allows for a future generalization to a semi-classical quantization of the geodesic motion in curved spacetimes. This result is obtained by modeling the slits in terms of eigenstates of the position operator.

## 21. Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics

**Authors:** Massimo Giovannini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11807v1)

**Summary:**

The entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation in the space-time curvature. It turns out that the quantum amplification is effective, provided the system is described by a pair of quantum oscillators and an appropriate Hermitian interaction.

## 22. Gaussian states in quantum field theory: Exact representations of   relative phase in superpositions of Gaussian states

**Authors:** Nicholas Funai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11799v1)

**Summary:**

Recent interest in qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime.
