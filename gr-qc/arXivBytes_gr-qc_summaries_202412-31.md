## 0. Holographic observers for time-band algebras

**Authors:** Kristan Jensen, Suvrat Raju, Antony J. Speranza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21185v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21185v1)

**Summary:**

We study the algebra of observables in a time band on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space in a theory of quantum gravity. Our construction requires a choice of dressing that determines how elements of the algebra transform under the Hamiltonian. At leading order in gravitational perturbation theory, our construction reduces to the modular crossed-product described previously in the literature. We also prove a theorem showing that this is the only crossed product of a type III$_1$ algebra resulting in an algebra with a trace.

## 1. Causality and Stability from Acoustic Geometry

**Authors:** Ignacy Sawicki, Georg Trenkler, Alexander Vikman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21169v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21169v1)

**Summary:**

Scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions form backgrounds which spontaneously break Lorentz invariance. We investigate the dynamics of free scalar perturbations on general anisotropic backgrounds. We demonstrate that the phonons move on null geodesics of an acoustic spacetime described by its own metric and own connection featuring nonmetricity with respect to the usual spacetime metric. We discuss the phonon properties that moving observers, inequivalent owing to the breaking of LorentZ invariance, would measure.

## 2. Junction conditions for higher order gravity theories from a   Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term

**Authors:** Marcos A. Ramirez, Cristián Martínez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21167v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we study the problem of generalizing the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms for general quadratic theories of gravity. From these terms we derive the junction conditions for a subset of this family of theories that includes Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity. We re-obtain the well-known results for GB theory, generalize them to other quadRatic theories and compare the resulting junction conditions with the ones already derived in the literature using other methods.

## 3. Topological dark energy from black-hole formations and mergers through   the gravity-thermodynamics approach

**Authors:** Stylianos A. Tsilioukas, Nicholas Petropoulos, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach in the case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector of topological origin. We estimate the black-hole formation and merger rates starting from the observed star formation rate per redshift. Finally, we study the effect of the other model parameters, showing that for the whole allowed observationally estimated ranges, the topological dark-energy equation-of-state parameter remains within its observational bounds.

## 4. Gravitational EFT for dissipative open systems

**Authors:** Pak Hang Chris Lau, Kanji Nishii, Toshifumi Noumi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21136v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity. Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics of the dissipative system of interest.

**Authors:** Oscar Castillo-Felisola, Bastian Grez, Manuel Morocho-López, Jose Perdiguero, Aureliano Skirzewski, Jefferson Vaca, Nicolas Zambra-Gómez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21122v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21122v1)

**Summary:**

The polynomial affine model of gravity was proposed as an alternative to metric and metric-affine gravitational models. It contains all possible combinations of the fields compatible with the covariance under diffeomorphisms. Here, we present a review of the advances in the analysis of the model after ten years of its proposal. We sketch the guideline of our future perspectives for the future of the field of gravitational theory and the theory of gravity in general. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.

## 6. All toric Kahler surfaces with twistor 2-forms

**Authors:** Sergei G. Ovchinnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21114v1)

**Summary:**

We complete the classification of all smooth 4-dimensional Kahler geometries admitting a twistor (conformal Killing-Yano) 2-form invariant under a 2-torus action. We establish that there are six geometrically distinct families, and we provide them in a simple form amenable to calculations and compute their curvature. We also find that for toric geometry the square norm of the twistor 2- form is quadratic in moment maps and we are led to conjecture that this holds when less symmetry is present.

## 7. Charged thin shells in unimodular gravity

**Authors:** Gabriel R. Bengochea, Ernesto F. Eiroa, Griselda Figueroa-Aguirre

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21098v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we construct a broad family of spacetimes with spherically symmetric thin shells in unimodular gravity. We analyze the dynamical stability of the configurations under perturbations preserving the symmetry. In particular, we consider the case of thin shells with charge surrounding vacuum, obtaining stable configurations for suitable values of the parameters. We compare our results with those corresponding to general relativity and show that they are consistent with the theory of relativity in some cases, but not all.

## 8. Effects of asymmetric dark matter on a magnetized neutron star: A   two-fluid approach

**Authors:** Pinku Routaray, Vishal Parmar, H. C. Das, Bharat Kumar, G. F. Burgio, H. -J. Schulze

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21097v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21097v1)

**Summary:**

We study the interaction between dark matter (DM) and highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs) We consider self-interacting, non-annihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles.

## 9. A Lorentz invariant formulation of artificial viscosity for the   relativistic Euler equations

**Authors:** Moritz Reintjes, Adhiraj Chaddha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21093v1)

**Summary:**

The vanishing (artificial) viscosity method has played a fundamental role in the theory of classical shock waves. For relativistic fluid flow, the underlying dissipation mechanism based on the Euclidean Laplace operator violates Lorentz invariance -- the fundamental principle of Special Relativity. In this paper we introduce a simple Dissipation mechanism for the relativistically Euler equations which is LorentZ invariant and consistent with the laws of Specialrelativity. We prove existence and decay of Fourier Laplace mode solutions (implying dissipation) and we prove that 1-D shock profiles exist if and only if the approximated shock waves are Lax admissible.

## 10. The (in)stability of quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black   hole in the hyperboloidal framework

**Authors:** Li-Ming Cao, Liang-Bi Wu, Yu-Sen Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. We also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of thehyperboloidal approach.

## 11. Inflation after Curvature Bounce

**Authors:** Rinat Kagirov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21087v1)

**Summary:**

We present a stable cosmological model of a closed universe in the presence of a conventional scalar field. The stability of the model and absence of singularity is ensured by spatial curvature without the need for additional peculiar matter. We reconstruct the Lagrangian and numerically compute observational predictions, including the number of e-folds, the spectral index $n_s$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We present several sets of parameters that satisfy the current observational data.

## 12. The 3BF theory as a TQFT

**Authors:** Tijana Radenkovic, Marko Vojinovic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032v1)

**Summary:**

We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. This state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) We provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQ FT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.

## 13. Holography dual of accelerating and rotating black hole in Nariai limit

**Authors:** Shu Luo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21013v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21013v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole. We define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties. We conclude by discussing some of the properties of the rotating C-metric model of the black hole in Nariai limit, which is related to Kerr-CFT correspondence.

## 14. New Black Hole Solutions of Second and First Order Formulations of   Nonlinear Electrodynamics

**Authors:** Yosef Verbin, Beyhan Pulice, Ali Övgün, Hyat Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989v1)

**Summary:**

In this first order formalism the field strength and the gauge potential are treated as independent. Several new spherically-symmetric objects are constructed analytically and their main properties are studied. The solutions are obtained in flat spacetime ignoring gravity. Among the self-gravitating solutions we find new black holes and study their main characteristics. Some of the solutions can regularize the total energy of a point charge although their black hole counterparts are not regular. We consider within this formalism alternative and generalized non-linear Lagrangian densities.

## 15. Fate of Mixmaster Chaos in a Deformed Algebra framework

**Authors:** G. Barca, E. Giovannetti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20983v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the anisotropic Bianchi models, and in particular the Bianchi Type IX known as the Mixmaster universe. We consider three different deformations, two of which have been able to remove the initial singularity similarly to Loop Quantum Cosmology when implemented to the single volume variable. Depending on the sign of the deformation, the dynamics will either settle into oscillations between two almost-constant angles, or stop reflecting after a finite number of iterations and reach the singularity as one last simple Kasner solution.

## 16. Dimensional Resonance Theory: An Evolutionary Approach to Universal Rest

**Authors:** Andre Carnevali da Silva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20961v1)

**Summary:**

Dimensional Resonance Theory proposes that gravity and fundamental forces can be interpreted as emergent phenomena arising from three-dimensional waves. We analyze the phi4 kink in (1+1) dimensions, an established topological defect with a well-known oscillation spectrum. We introduce an emergent gravitational term, h00(x), regulated by a coupling parameter G, under a linearized regime valid up to G = 0.02. We discuss the implications of these findings, connections to other emergent gravity approaches, and extensions to nonlinear regimes, higher-dimensional frameworks and time quantization.

## 17. Environmental gravitational decoherence with higher derivative theory

**Authors:** Linda M. van Manen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20929v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the decoherence in a quantum system induced by interaction with gravitational degrees of freedom that are part of a higher derivative theory. The deformation of a mass distribution due to gravitational waves acquires naturally a mass quadrupole moment. We first derive a Langevin equation for a lower derivative model and show how higher derivatives naturally emerge on the boundary. A quantum master equation is derived for the emerging quadrupoles moment, considering that the environment is a high derivative theory of gravity. This model focuses on the open dynamics of the quadrupol moment, rather than on individual particles. As such, a short example is given to utilizequadrupole measurements to probe gravitational decoherent and noise.

## 18. Petrov Types for the Weyl Tensor via the Riemannian-to-Lorentzian Bridge

**Authors:** Amir Babak Aazami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20915v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze oriented Riemannian 4-manifolds whose Weyl tensors $W$ satisfy the conformally invariant condition $W(T,\cdot,\CDot,T) = 0$ for some nonzero vector $T$. While this can be algebraically classified via $W's normal form, we find a further geometric classification by deforming the metric into a Lorentzian one via $T. We show that such a $W $ will have the analogue of Petrov Types from general relativity, that only Types I and D can occur.

## 19. Gravitational waves from cosmic strings for pedestrians

**Authors:** Kai Schmitz, Tobias Schröder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20907v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20907v1)

**Summary:**

Cosmic strings represent an attractive source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. computing the GW signal from cosmic strings requires the numerical evaluation of complicated integral and sum expressions. This shortcoming motivates us to rederive theGW signal from a network of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation. We provide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their characteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors. We conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas that can readily be used in future studies.

## 20. Superradiance in acoustic black hole

**Authors:** Chengye Yu, Xiaolin Zhang, Sobhan Kazempour, Sichun Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20890v1)

**Summary:**

Superradiance can occur in acoustic black holes when the general superradiance condition is met. Amplification effect is significantly weaker in black holes than in regular cylinders, due to the absorption in such structure. Superradiance in cylinders has recently been observed experimentally using acoustic waves to shed light on the understanding of the superradiant phenomenon in black hole. In this paper, for the first time, we study superradiances inoustic black holes through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation using COMSOL multiphysics.

## 21. Complete Classification of Analytical Models in Einstein-Aether   Cosmology

**Authors:** R. Chan, M. F. A. da Silva, V. H. Satheeshkumar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20856v1)

**Summary:**

We present all possible analytical solutions of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in Einstein-aether theory. We analyze the dynamics of each model analytically and also graphically by plotting the geometric radius, Hubble and deceleration parameters along with the effective energy conditions. All our results are compared with the corresponding models in General Relativity. We found eight models that are entirely void of any aether. In such a universe aether does not play any role cosmologically, although it affects the solar system dynamics.

## 22. Constraining the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity using   cosmological data

**Authors:** Shambel Sahlu, Amare Abebe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20831v1)

**Summary:**

This paper examines the late-time accelerating Universe and the formation of large-scale structures within the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity framework. We evaluate the cosmological viability of this model, using 57 Observational Hubble Data (OHD) points, 1048 supernovae distance modulus measurements (SNIa) and 14 growth rate data points (f-data) The values suggest that our model holds significant promise in addressing the Cosmological tensions. We conclude by suggesting that the $f(Q)$-gravity model could be used to predict the future of the universe.

## 23. Quantum flux operators in the fermionic theory and their supersymmetric   extension

**Authors:** Si-Mao Guo, Wen-Bin Liu, Jiang Long

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20829v1)

**Summary:**

We construct quantum flux operators with respect to the Poincar\'e symmetry in the massless Dirac theory at future null infinity. An anomalous helicity flux operator emerges from the commutator of the superrotation generators. We also find its relation to the non-closure of the Lie transport of the spinor field around a loop. We discuss various algebras formed by these operators and constrain the test functions by the requirement of eliminating non-local terms and satisfying the Jacobi identities. Furthermore, we explore their supersymmetric extension in the Wess-Zumino model.

## 24. Constraining the $f$-mode oscillations frequency in Neutron Stars   through Universal Relations in the realm of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity

**Authors:** Sayantan Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20815v1)

**Summary:**

Neutron stars (NSs) provide an ideal laboratory for probing general relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime. Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) is a modified theory of gravity that extends GR by including nonlinear terms involving the energy-momentum tensor. This study examines the effects of EMSG on the properties and behaviour of NSs by varying the free parameter $alpha$. Results indicate that the Stiff EOS undergoes a phase transition at the highest energy densities and pressures.

## 25. Robust Bayesian inference with gapped LISA data using all-in-one   TDI-$\infty$

**Authors:** Niklas Houba, Jean-Baptiste Bayle, Michele Vallisneri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20793v1)

**Summary:**

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. LISA will enable studies of astrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data is the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using time-delay interferometry (TDI) Classical TDI mitigates this noise by algebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and spacecraft.

## 26. Pre-trained Audio Transformer as a Foundational AI Tool for   Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Chayan Chatterjee, Abigail Petulante, Karan Jani, Jesse Spencer-Smith, Yang Hu, Roy Lau, Haowei Fu, Trang Hoang, Stephen Chong Zhao, Suyash Deshmukh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20789v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20789v1)

**Summary:**

The number of signals recorded by Advanced LIGO and Virgo from merging compact objects is expected to rise dramatically. This surge in detection rates necessitates the development of adaptable, scalable, and efficient tools. Foundational AI models present a transformative opportunity in this context by providing a unified framework that can be fine tuned for diverse applications while leveraging the power of large scale pre training. In this work, we explore how advanced transformer models, specifically Whisper by OpenAI, can be adapted as a foundational model for gravitational wave data analysis.

## 27. Gravitational Lensing and Image Distortion by Buchdahl Inspired Metric   in $\mathcal{R}^2$ Gravity

**Authors:** Shafia Maryam, Mubasher Jamil, Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou, Zoe C S Chan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20745v1)

**Summary:**

In strong deflection limit, we derive the deflection angle analytically for the light rays that diverge as photons approach the photon sphere. These are then used in order to compute the angular image positions modeling supermassive black holes, Sgr A* and M87* as lenses. The Einstein rings for the outermost relativistic images are also depicted here alongside observational constraints on $k$ by the Einstein radius and lens mass. It is shown that image distortion satisfies the hypothesis of Virbhadra.

## 28. SgrA* spin and mass estimates through the detection of multiple   extremely large mass-ratio inspirals

**Authors:** Verónica Vázquez-Aceves, Yiren Lin, Alejandro Torres-Orjuela

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20738v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the parameter estimation accuracy that can be achieved for the mass and spin of SgrA*, the SMBH in our Galactic Center. XMRIs are formed by brown dwarfs (BD) inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH), thus emitting gravitational waves (GWs) inside the detection band of future space-based detectors such as LISA and TianQin. Theoretical estimates suggest the presence of approximately 10 X MRIs emitting detectable GWs, making them some of the most promising candidates for space- based GW detectors.

## 29. Linear perturbations of symmetric teleparallel gravity on Minkowski   background

**Authors:** Dehao Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20696v1)

**Summary:**

Symmetric teleparallel gravity (STG) can be regarded as a modified gravity theory that lacks diffeomorphism symmetries. In this study, we analyze the linear perturbations of general STG models on a Minkowski background, considering both scenarios with and without scalar couplings. Furthermore, we provide lower bounds for the number of degrees of freedom associated with each model. We conclude that STG can be viewed as a new type of gravity theory, and that it can be used to develop new theories of gravity.

## 30. The second order quasi-normal modes for an AdS$_4$ black brane

**Authors:** Wen-Bin Pan, ZhangPing Yu, Yi Ling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20683v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20683v1)

**Summary:**

We study the second order gravitational perturbations in an AdS black brane background. The resonance occurs at special positions in momentum space, where the amplitude becomes divergent. This phenomenon is in contrast to what is observed in asymptotically flat spacetime. The condition leading to the resonance is that the combined frequency of two sources coincides with one of another first order quasi-normal mode. The quadratic-to-linear ratio of amplitudes at horizon is found to be of order one in general.

## 31. The Advantage of Early Detection and Localization from   Eccentricity-Induced Higher Harmonic Modes in Second-Generation Ground-Based   Detector Networks

**Authors:** Tao Yang, Rong-Gen Cai, Zhoujian Cao, Hyung Mok Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20664v1)

**Summary:**

Early detection and localization of gravitational waves (GWs) are crucial for identifying and capturing their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. For second-generation (2G) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, the typical duration of GW signals ranges from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ seconds to several tens of seconds. This limited duration is insufficient to provide adequate early warning and localization for potential GWs and their associated EM counterparts. In this paper, we investigate whether eccentricity-induced higher harmonic modes, which enter the detector band much earlier than the dominant mode, can aid early detection of GW sources.
