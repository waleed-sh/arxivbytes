## 0. Higher-spin effects in black hole and neutron star binary dynamics:   worldline supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling

**Authors:** Domenico Bonocore, Anna Kulesza, Johannes Pirsch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11488v1)

**Summary:**

The inclusion of spin effects in the binary dynamics for black hole and neutron stars is crucial for the computation of gravitational wave observables. Worldline supersymmetric models have shown to be particularly efficient at this task up to quadratic order in spin, but progress at higher orders has been hampered by no-go-theorems. In this work we propose a novel approach to overcome this problem by extending the supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by computing an all-order in spin and linear in curvature.

## 1. Area and volume from entangled qubits

**Authors:** Juan M. Romero, Emiliano Montoya-González

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11487v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11487v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper a relation between entangled states and geometry is studied. In particular, the area of 2D parallelogram is obtained from an entangled 4-qubit state. In addition, the vector area of a 3D parallelepiped is derived from entangled 6-qu bit states. It has been provided the quantum circuit in qiskit code for these entangled states. The paper concludes that parallelograms andparallelepipeds serve as fundamental building blocks for more sophisticated geometric structures.

## 2. Complementary Probes of Gravitational Radiation States

**Authors:** Sreenath K. Manikandan, Frank Wilczek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11422v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate that the statistical fluctuations in resonant radiation detectors operating in homodyne and heterodyne modes offers additional, complementary information to that obtained from their direct operation as click detectors. We use this to refine tests of the coherent state hypothesis of interest in connection with gravitational wave fields. The results will be used to test the theory of gravitational wave waves in space and time. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Radioactivity and Radioactivity (ASR) (http://www.astrophysics.org/ASR/2013/01/27/astronomy-of-Radioactive-Radioactivity-and-Radiofrequency.html).

## 3. Probing Quantum Structure in Gravitational Radiation

**Authors:** Sreenath K. Manikandan, Frank Wilczek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11407v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational radiation from known astrophysical sources is conventionally treated classically. This treatment corresponds, implicitly, to the hypothesis that a particular class of quantum-mechanical states -- the so-called coherent states -- adequately describe the gravitational radiation field. We propose practicable, quantitative tests of that hypothesis using resonant bar detectors monitored in coincidence with LIGO-style interferometers. Our tests readily distinguish fields that contain significant thermal components or squeezing. We identify concrete circumstances in which the classical (i.e., coherent state) hypothesis is likely to fail.

## 4. On Kerr black hole formation with complete apparent horizon and a new   approach toward Penrose inequality

**Authors:** Xinliang An, Taoran He

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11399v1)

**Summary:**

We show that 3+1 dimensional Einstein vacuum equations admit dynamical Kerr black hole formation solutions. Our hyperbolic arguments combine the scale-critical gravitational-collapse result by An--Luk with the recent breakthrough by Klainerman--Szeftel on proving nonlinear Kerr stability with small angular momentum. Collectively, without assuming any symmetry, we extend Christodoulou's celebrated trapped surface formation theorem to a black Hole formation result. We then put forward a new mathematical framework and prove both the dynamical Penrose inequality and the spacetime Penroseequality in our black-hole formation spacetimes.

## 5. Weakly-Coupled Trace Anomaly Action for Gravity

**Authors:** Gregory Gabadadze, Giorgi Tukhashvili

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11397v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss a local, diff-invariant quantum effective action for gravity. We show how the counter-term leads to a scattering amplitude that is strongly coupled at arbitrarily low energies. Three Appendices summarize quantum effective actions for the scale anomaly in 4D QED, for the axial anomaly in 2DQED, and for the size anomaly in a 2D sigma model. We highlight connections between their local, and seemingly non-local formulations. We conclude by discussing some physical consequences due to the new sector.

## 6. Features of the Partition Function of a $Λ>0$ Universe

**Authors:** Dionysios Anninos, Chiara Baracco, Samuel Brian, Frederik Denef

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11330v1)

**Summary:**

We consider properties of the gravitational path integral of a four-dimensional gravitational effective field theory. We discuss how a general positive curvature Einstein metric contributes to the theory. Along the way, we discuss Einstein-Maxwell theory and identify an interesting class of closed non-Einstein gravitational instantons. We present exact one-loop results for scalar particles, Maxwell theory, and Einstein gravity about the Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}P^2$. We provide a detailed study for the specific case of the saddle with second largest volume and positive definite tensor eigenspectrum.

## 7. Dark standard siren cosmology with bright galaxy subsets

**Authors:** Khuzaifa Naveed, Cezary Turski, Archisman Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11268v1)

**Summary:**

The paper looks at the impact of selecting only a subset of bright galaxies to provide redshift information for a dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant. It lays the foundation for employing alternative tracers -- such as brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and luminous red galaxies (LRGs) -- in gravitational-wave cosmology, particularly at redshifts where conventional galaxy catalogues offer limited coverage. A comprehensive assessment of systematic uncertainties is still required, the authors say. The paper is published by The Astrophysical Journal, a division of the journal Nature.

## 8. Inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms with gravitational self-force results   within the effective-one-body formalism

**Authors:** Benjamin Leather, Alessandra Buonanno, Maarten van de Meent

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11242v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11242v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational self-force (GSF) theory is a strong-gravity perturbative approach to the relativistic two-body problem. We show that our model outperforms inspiral waveforms from full 2GSF calculations in the intermediate-to-comparable mass regime. We benchmark our model against high-accuracy, nonspinning numerical-relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) catalogue and find that its median mismatch is comparable to that of SEOBNRv5.

## 9. Conformal transformations of spacetimes without observer horizons

**Authors:** Leonardo García-Heveling, Abdelghani Zeghib

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11148v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that for a certain class of Lorentzian manifolds, namely causal spacetimes without observer horizons, conformal transformations can be classified into two types: escaping and non-escaping. This means that successive powers of a given conformal transformation will either send all points to infinity, or none. We also study the question of essentiality in this context, i.e. which conformal Transformations are isometric for some metric in the conformal class. As an application, we classify the conformal transformations of Einstein's static universe.

## 10. Can we distinguish whether black holes have singularities or not through   echoes and light rings?

**Authors:** Xiao-Pin Rao, Hyat Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11073v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11073v1)

**Summary:**

A recent work shows that the curvature singularity of a black hole can vanish at a fine-tuned mass value. This implies that regular black holes could be special states in black hole evolution. We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Bardeen black hole and its singular counterparts under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. The time-domain analysis results suggest that echo signals may emerge in the QNMs of singular black hole states. Furthermore, we investigate the null geodesics of these black holes.

## 11. Dynamical Stability and Critical Exponents of the Neutral (S-type)   Gubser-Rocha Model with Momentum Dissipation

**Authors:** Shuta Ishigaki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11052v1)

**Summary:**

The (S-type) Gubser-Rocha model is a holographic model, which can be derived from the maximal gauged supergravity in four dimensions. With an appropriate choice of the boundary action, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition in the neutral limit. In addition, we find that there is an emergent Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase of the S-type model. The dynamical stability of the model agrees with the thermodynamic stability.

## 12. Einstein Telescope an Cosmic Explorer

**Authors:** Matteo Di Giovanni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11033v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer ground based gravitational wave detectors. These detectors will be up to a factor 8 more sensitive across the band covered by current detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. Improvements will not only enhance the number and quality of GW observations, but will also enable researchers to have access to sources and physical processes which are out of reach for current detectors. The improvement in sensitivity in the low frequency regime will also increase the observation time of compact binary coalescence events, strengthening the collaboration with electromagnetic observatories.

## 13. Black hole thermodynamics probes the equivalence principle

**Authors:** Ana Alonso-Serrano, Luis J. Garay, Marek Liška

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10934v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10934v1)

**Summary:**

Lanczos-Lovelock gravity violates the strong equivalence principle. General relativity is the only local, diffeomorphism-invariant theory compatible with it. We also show that certain nonlocal expressions for black hole entropy appear to obey the strong equivalence principle but not all of them do. We present a simple theoretical criterion for identifying equivalence violations in black hole thermodynamics. The paper is published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 14. Graviton-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields

**Authors:** Wataru Chiba, Ryusuke Jinno, Kimihiro Nomura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10926v1)

**Summary:**

We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. We find that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity. A peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Gravitons and Photons, published by the University of California, Los Angeles.
