## 0. Pushing limits: Probing new gravity using a satellite constellation

**Authors:** Viktor T. Toth

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06106v1)

**Summary:**

A constellation placed at 30 astronomical units may approach sensitivities that are sufficient to detect cosmological dark matter and dark energy constituents. The sensitivity of the experiment improves at larger heliocentric distances. A refined model, calculated with extended numerical precision, confirms that exceptional sensitivity is possible, placing within reach observational tests of certain modified gravity theories (e.g., Yukawa terms, galileons) The sensitivity is still well within the domain of feasibility using available propulsion and deep space communication technologies.

## 1. The Spectre of Underdetermination in Modern Cosmology

**Authors:** Pedro G. Ferreira, William J. Wolf, James Read

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06095v1)

**Summary:**

The scientific status of physical cosmology has been the subject of philosophical debate ever since Einstein's general theory of relativity. This article revisits, in light of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier debate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow. We argue that modern cosmology faces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the microphysical nature of its exotic energy components. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects for future breakthroughs and/or non-empirical arguments which could decide this issue conclusively.

## 2. The Role of Type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann Algebras and their Tensor   Structure in Quantum Gravity}}

**Authors:** Manfred Requardt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06009v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that the type classification of v.Neumann algebras play an important role in a theory of quantum gravity and quantum space-time physics. We provide arguments that type $II_1$ and its representation as a tensor product of an ordinary (exterior) Hilbert space algebra do represent the first step away from the semiclassical picture towards a full theory ofQuantum gravity. We also argue that type. $II_{\infty}$ is encoding, in our view, the hidden microscopic gravitational degrees of freedom.

## 3. Black hole-disc coevolution in the presence of magnetic fields: refining   the Thorne limit with emission from within the plunging region

**Authors:** Andrew Mummery

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05843v1)

**Summary:**

 accretion of material onto a black hole modifies the properties of that hole owing to the capture of both matter and radiation. Adding matter to the hole through an accretion disc generally acts to increase the hole's spin parameter. The capture of radiation generally provides a retarding torque. The balance between the torques provided by adding matter and. radiation leads to a maximum spin parameter that can be obtained by a. black hole which grows by accretion. In the simplest theory of thin disc accretion this Thorne limit has the value $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.998$. The purpose of this paper is to highlight that any modification to theories of accretion flows also modify this limiting value

## 4. Relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in the early Universe

**Authors:** Alberto Roper Pol, Antonino Salvino Midiri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05732v1)

**Summary:**

The conservation laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can be applied to the study of early Universe physics during the epoch of radiation domination. The conservation laws for a conducting perfect fluid with relativistic bulk velocities in an expanding background are presented. We review the propagation of sound waves, Alfv\'en waves, and magnetosonic waves, as well as the Boris correction for relatvistic Alfv \'en speeds. This review is an extension, including new results, of part of the lectures presented by A. Roper Pol and J. Schober at EPFL in 2024.

## 5. The Extended Uncertainty Principle from an Operational Viewpoint

**Authors:** Thomas Sch√ºrmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05713v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the traditional inequalities of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) from the perspective of operational quantum mechanics. Instead of relying on purely wavefunction-based measures, we introduce a apparatus-centred definition of positional uncertainty. Using hermitian EUP momentum operators, we establish a rigorous new lower bound on the uncertainty product. Extending these ideas to three (and $d) dimensions, we also derive an analogous lower bound for systems confined in higher-dimensional spherical regions of radius $R$.
