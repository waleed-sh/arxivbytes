## 0. Quasi-Keplerian parametrization for compact binaries on hyperbolic   orbits in scalar-tensor theories at second post-Newtonian order

**Authors:** Davide Usseglio, David Trestini, Abhishek Chowdhuri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13829v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain the generalized quasi-Keplerian parametrization for compact binaries on quasihyperbolic orbits at second post-Newtonian (2PN) order in a class of massless scalar-tensor theories. In particular, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impact parameter at 2PN. We then compute the total energy and angular momentum lost by the system. Finally, we obtain, in general relativity, an expression for the 3PN impact parameter in the conservative sector.

## 1. High Energy String Theory and the Celestial Sphere

**Authors:** Xavier Kervyn, Stephan Stieberger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13738v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate on a string world-sheet connection to flat space-time holography. We show that this picture continues to hold at all subleading orders in the quantum fluctuations around this classical configuration. As a consequence there is a dual description of the high energy limit of string theory as the large energy expansion on the celestial sphere organized by (light) higher spin modes. This approach points to an intrinsic construction of celestial conformal field theory (CFT) by relating it to a (free) world-sheets CFT.

## 2. Dynamics of Geodesics in Non-linear Electrodynamics Corrected Black Hole   and Shadows of its Rotating Analogue

**Authors:** Hari Prasad Saikia, Mrinnoy M. Gohain, Kalyan Bhuyan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13466v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13466v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate photon geodesics in a static black hole spacetime. We use a model inspired by the confinement of heavy quark-antiquark pairs that recovers Maxwell's theory in the strong-field limit. We then generate the spinning analogue via the Newman-Janis algorithm, and analyze its resulting ergosphere and shadow profile. We integrate the null geodesic equations to characterize critical orbits and deflection angles in the NLED background. To explore rotational effects, we then generate a spinning analogue.

## 3. Dynamics and gravitational radiation of binaries with spin precession   and eccentricity in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity

**Authors:** Zhao Li, Wen Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13450v1)

**Summary:**

Dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity has attracted significant attention in recent gravitational wave (GW) studies. This work explores the dynamics and gravitational radiation from the binary black hole systems with orbital eccentricity and spin precession. It provides the theoretical foundation for the complete waveform construction in dCS gravity, benefiting the future gravitational parity-symmetry tests. It is based on the quasi-Keplerian parameterization of the gravitational and scalar radiation from binary black holes.

## 4. Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the   Absolute Magnitude

**Authors:** Jing-Yi Jia, Jia-Lei Niu, Da-Chun Qiang, Hao Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380v1)

**Summary:**

The Hubble tension is the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.
