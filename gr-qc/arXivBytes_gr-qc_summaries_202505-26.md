## 0. First astrometric constraints on parity-violation in the gravitational   wave background

**Authors:** Santiago Jaraba, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Qiuyue Liang, Meng-Xiang Lin, Mark Trodden

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18085v1)

**Summary:**

Astrometry offers a promising approach to probing the low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) Astrometric vector sky maps are sensitive to parity-violating SGWB signals, which cannot be distinguished using pulsar timing array observations in an isotropic SGWB. We present the first astrometric constraints on parity- violating SGWB using quasar catalogs from Gaia DR3 and VLBA data. Although not currently a tight constraint on theoretical models, this first attempt lays the groundwork for future investigations using more precise astrometry data.

## 1. The Noether formalism for constructing conserved quantities in   teleparallel equivalents of general relativity

**Authors:** E. D. Emtsova, A. N. Petrov, A. V. Toporensky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18084v1)

**Summary:**

 conserved currents, superpotentials, and charges are constructed. These are shown to be covariant under coordinate transformations and local Lorentz rotations in TEGR, while in STEGR they are not. The teleparallel (flat) connections in both theories are defined using the "turning off gravity" principle. Uniting such defined flat connections with tetrad in T EGR and metric in STegR a new fruitful in applications notion "gauge" is introduced.

## 2. Inflaton Dynamics in Higher-Derivative Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity

**Authors:** Sam E. Brady, Katy Clough, Pau Figueras, Áron D. Kovács

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17986v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17986v1)

**Summary:**

During inflation, higher derivative terms in the gravitational action may play a significant role. We study the impact of these corrections in the case where the inflaton is also the additional scalar degree of freedom of the modified theory. This case is highly restricted by requiring that in the homogeneous limit inflation must still work, and that the initial data must be in the weak coupling limit. We show that in principle it is possible to drive the field out of the weak-coupling regime from a starting point well within it.

## 3. Charged black holes in Kalb-Ramond gravity: Weak Deflection Angle,   Shadow cast, Quasinormal Modes and Neutrino annihilation

**Authors:** Reggie C. Pantig, Ali Övgün, Ángel Rincón

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17947v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of electrically charged black holes in a Lorentz-violating gravitational framework mediated by a background Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymmetric tensor field. Employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in a non-asymptotically flat geometry, we derive analytic expressions for the weak deflection angle of light and massive particles. Constraints derived from Event Horizon Telescope data for Sgr A* and M87* validate the model and provide stringent bounds on $ \ell $.

## 4. The impact of compact object deformation on thin accretion disk   properties

**Authors:** Shokoufe Faraji

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17924v1)

**Summary:**

The main purpose of this work is to determine whether such a deformed object possesses its own observational fingerprint that can distinguish it from Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. We investigate the standard relativistic geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disk in the background of a Deformed compact object. Our analysis reveals the properties of this relativistically accretion disks model and its dependence on the initial parameters. We also show the dependence of this model on the shape of the object.

## 5. Influence of cosmic expansion on gravitational waveforms

**Authors:** Tan Liu, Wen-Fan Feng, Zong-Kuan Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17886v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves undergo redshift as they propagate through the expanding universe. The redshift may exhibit time-dependent drift. We show that dimensionless source parameters depending on mass can break this degeneracy. The postmerger signal from binary neutron stars contains several dimensionless parameters that satisfy this condition, including the quality factors of different frequency components and their frequency ratios. We present a corrected derivation of the waveform phase correction due to the redshift drift effect, rectifying a sign error in previous studies.

## 6. Gravitational waves from strong first order phase transitions

**Authors:** José Correia, Mark Hindmarsh, Kari Rummukainen, David J. Weir

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17824v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17824v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave power approaches a constant with a power law in time, from which can be derived a gravitational wave production efficiency. Vortical modes do not contribute greatly to the produced gravitational wave power spectra even in the deflagration, where they dominate over a range of wavenumbers. In both cases, we observe dissipation of kinetic energy by acoustic turbulence, and in the case of the detonation an accompanying growth in the integral scale of the flow. The corresponding fractional density in gravitational radiation today, normalised by the square of the mean bubble spacing in Hubble units, is about 0.017.

## 7. Searching for extreme mass ratio inspirals in LISA: from identification   to parameter estimation

**Authors:** Stefan H. Strub, Lorenzo Speri, Domenico Giardini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17814v1)

**Summary:**

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) within the millihertz frequency range. LISA is anticipated to observe the inspiral of compact objects into black holes at the centers of galaxies. However, the extraction of these long-lived complex signals is challenging due to the large size and multimodality of the search space. This work is an important step in understanding how to extract EMRIs from future LISA data.

## 8. Primordial black holes through preheating instabilities in   $α$-attractor models

**Authors:** Daniel del-Corral, Paolo Gondolo, K. Sravan Kumar, João Marto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17790v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the context of inflationary models. During this phase, self-resonance instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a quadratic form. We calculate the PBH mass fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms. Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance during preheating.

## 9. Does Unruh effect necessarily imply entanglement?

**Authors:** Vaibhav Wasnik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17744v1)

**Summary:**

We show that despite the fact that an accelerating observer would note the Minkowski vacuum to be thermal, an inconsistency is implied writing the Minksowski vacuum as an entangled state between Rindler wedges. We highlight the reason behind the inconsistency in the derivation as an issue with expanding the relevant fields in a complete set of frequency modes. We next highlight issues in this textbook derivation by first noting the blowing up of Bogoluibov coefficients at $k=0$, followed by showing that that two point correlation function evaluations are inconsistent.

## 10. Time-frequency structure in the post-merger binary black hole   gravitational wave signal

**Authors:** Chad Henshaw, Alice Heranval, Laura Cadonati

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17743v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave signals from asymmetric binary black hole systems have been shown to exhibit additional chirps beyond the primary merger chirp in the post-merger region of the time-frequency domain. We find that the inclusion of strong aligned spin $\left(\xi = 0.75\right)$ induces further post-Merger time- frequency peaks. We show that even mild precessing spin strongly affects the distribution of post- merger radiative power across the celestial sky of the final black hole.

## 11. Continuing Isaacson's Legacy: A general metric theory perspective on   gravitational memory and the non-linearity of gravity

**Authors:** Jann Zosso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17603v1)

**Summary:**

The challenge of defining a physical notion of gravitational waves is a long-standing problem. The Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) spacetime symmetry at null infinity and its connection to gravitational memory is a major contribution to an understanding of waves in gravitation. The work of Isaacson equally leads to the inevitable presence of displacement memory, and provides additional understanding of the phenomenon. In particular, the Isaacson viewpoint allows for an efficient method to compute gravitational displacement memory in general metric theories of gravity.

## 12. Exploring gravastar-like structures with strongly interacting quark   matter shell in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity under conformal symmetry

**Authors:** Debadri Bhattacharjee, Pradip Kumar Chattopadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17583v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate gravastar-like structures in static and spherically symmetric space-time within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity coupled with conformal symmetry. We have used the Israel junction condition to evaluate the mass of the thin shell for different choices of characteristic radii. We found that for radii 9.009, 10.009 and 11.009 the mass increases as $1.80,~1.95 and $2.28~M_{\odot}$.

## 13. The primordial angular power spectrum from the alternative mass function   in loop quantum cosmology

**Authors:** Abolhassan Mohammadi, Bao-Fei Li, Tao Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17554v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the cosmological impacts of the alternative effective mass function of the modified Mukhanov-Sasaki equation in loop quantum cosmology. We find that the fine structure of the primordial power spectrum sensitively relies on the parameters in the polymerization ansatz. For the angular power spectrum, we find $\xi=0.2$ provides the best-fit curve to the result from the $\Lambda$CDM model. The study presents a concrete example in which the fine Structure of thePrimordial power Spectrum sensitively depends on the Parameter in the Polymerization Ansatz.

## 14. Are single-field models of inflation and PBH production ruled out by ACT   observations?

**Authors:** Daniel Frolovsky, Sergei V. Ketov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17514v1)

**Summary:**

The data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) imposes stronger constraints on primordial black hole (PBH) formation in single-field inflation models than the Planck data. We investigate an impact of bending of the inflaton potential plateau toward reconciling the model with the new bounds for CMB observables. A possible model-building approach to resolve the tension is proposed. We find that attempts to increase $n_s$ by upward bending lead to negative values of $\alpha_s $ that are disfavored by the new limits.

## 15. Superradiance of Charged Static Black Hole in Cubic Gravity

**Authors:** Seyed Naseh Sajadi, Supakchai Ponglertsakul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17429v1)

**Summary:**

Higher curvature gravity usually has complicated field equations, and solving them analytically is strenuous. In this work, we obtain an analytical charged black hole (BH) solution using the thermodynamics of black holes and employing the continued fraction expansion. We demonstrate how the amplification factor will change as a function of the black hole charge and frequency of the incident wave. We also show that a black hole mass and charge are decreasing in the superradiance region of Einstein-cubic gravity.

## 16. Interpretation of complexity for spherically symmetric fluid composition   within the context of modified gravity theory

**Authors:** A. Rehman, Tayyab Naseer, Baiju Dayanandan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17424v1)

**Summary:**

The inner spacetime is assumed to be spherically symmetric static composition. The orthogonal splitting of the curvature tensor yields the complexity factor. It is noted that celestial formations having anisotropic and non-uniform compositions of matter assert the utmost complexity. Nevertheless, the spheric symmetric matter distribution may not exhibit complexity in the scenario of vanishing impacts of non-homogenous energy density and an isotropic pressure due to the presence of dark source terms associated with this extended gravity theory.

## 17. Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015   Data

**Authors:** Yun Wang, Katherine Freese

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415v1)

**Summary:**

Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density. We find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1.2$\sigma$ for $w_X(z)$ at $z=2/3. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy, the authors say.
