## 0. Linear matter density perturbations in the $Λ_{\rm s}$CDM model:   Examining growth dynamics and addressing the $S_8$ tension

**Authors:** Özgür Akarsu, Arman Çam, Evangelos A. Paraskevas, Leandros Perivolaropoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20384v1)

**Summary:**

We use two complementary approaches: determining the initial density contrast and its evolution rate for a given collapse scale factor. We derive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$ in both models. Using the Planck best-fit values, we find $f =0.49$ and $ f=0.53$, respectively. This suggests that the structure growth anomaly may resolve the growth anomaly, without deviating from $gamma \sim 0.55$.

## 1. Inferring Black Hole Spin from Interferometric Measurements of the First   Photon Ring: A Geometric Approach

**Authors:** Lennox S. Keeble, Alejandro Cárdenas-Avendaño, Daniel C. M. Palumbo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20312v1)

**Summary:**

Accurately inferring black hole spin is crucial for understanding black hole dynamics and their astrophysical environments. In this work, we outline a geometric method for spin estimation by using the interferometric shape of the first photon ring. We find that the inferred asymmetry of the $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be heavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental. Remarkably, even using only the ring's asymmetry, we can establish lower bounds on the spin.

## 2. Nyquist-resolving gravitational waves via orbital frequency-based   refinement

**Authors:** William K. Black, David Neilsen, Eric W. Hirschmann, David F. Van Komen, Milinda Fernando

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20282v1)

**Summary:**

Adaptive mesh refinement efficiently facilitates the computation of gravitational waveforms in numerical relativity. But determining precisely when, where, and to what extent to refine when solving the Einstein equations poses challenges. This work introduces an optimized resolution baseline derived in situ from the inspiral trajectory (ORBIT) This method uses the binary's orbital frequency as a proxy for anticipated gravitational waves to dynamically refine the grid, satisfying the Nyquist frequency requirements on grid resolution. ORBIT sustains propagation of gravitational waves while avoiding the more costly alternative of maintaining high resolution across an entire simulation.

## 3. Model spaces as constrained Hamiltonian systems: I. Application to   $\mathrm{SU}(2)$

**Authors:** Glenn Barnich, Thomas Smoes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20267v1)

**Summary:**

We study model spaces and their quantization from the viewpoint of constrained Hamiltonian systems. The analysis sheds some light on the definition and properties of spin-weighted/monopole spherical harmonics. Besides recovering well-known results on the quantum theory of angular momentum from a unified perspective, the analysis also recovers some information about the definition of spherical harmonICS. We work out all details in the simplest case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We conclude with a discussion of the group-theoretical questions relevant to the gravitational setting.

## 4. Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via   Machine Learning

**Authors:** N. K. Patra, Tuhin Malik, Helena Pais, Kai Zhou, B. K. Agrawal, Constança Providência

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20226v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20226v1)

**Summary:**

We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star observables and the underlying EoS parameters. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$.

## 5. Stability of multi-state configurations of fuzzy dark matter

**Authors:** Francisco S. Guzman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20222v1)

**Summary:**

We study the stability properties of multi-state configurations of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system without self-interaction. We show these configurations studied are stable using numerical simulations. The astrophysical implication of this result is that this type of configurations is at least stable and can be considered physically sound in multi- state ultralight bosonic dark matter. The study covers a range of states with monopolar to dipolar mass ratio between 47 and 0.17. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 6. Unveiling Orbital Chaos: The Wild Heart of Fuzzy Dark Matter Structures

**Authors:** Ivan Alvarez-Rios, Francisco S. Guzman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20205v1)

**Summary:**

Study of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure. Core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. No trajectory remains circular, trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps.

## 7. Gentle spaghettification in effective LQG dust collapse

**Authors:** Francesco Fazzini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20187v1)

**Summary:**

 effective dust collapse inspired by loop quantum gravity predicts two main features for general realistic initial profiles. These are a gravitational bounce of the stellar core, when the energy density becomes planckian, and shell-crossing singularities. The aim of this work is to study the mathematical and physical features of the effective spacetime near these singularities, through the Jacobi deviation equation. The results show that the radial and angular deviations between dust particles remain finite at both the bounce andShell-Crossing singularity. This provides a physical justification for extending the spacetime beyond shell- crossing singularities through weak solutions.

## 8. Love numbers beyond GR from the modified Teukolsky equation

**Authors:** Pablo A. Cano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20185v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20185v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain the full set of tidal Love numbers of non-rotating black holes in an effective field theory extension of general relativity. The modified Teukolsky equation proves to be very useful as it allows us to obtain all the different Love numbers in a unified framework. We observe that there are three types of Love numbers: electric, magnetic, and a ``mixing'' type, associated to parity-breaking theories, that we identify here for the first time. The method introduced here paves the way towards the computation of Love number of rotating black holes beyond general relativity, we say.

**Authors:** Jun Luo, Haipeng An, Ligong Bian, Rong-Gen Cai, Zhoujian Cao, Wenbiao Han, Jianhua He, Martin A. Hendry, Bin Hu, Yi-Ming Hu, Fa Peng Huang, Shun-Jia Huang, Sang Pyo Kim, En-Kun Li, Yu-Xiao Liu, Vadim Milyukov, Shi Pi, Konstantin Postnov, Misao Sasaki, Cheng-Gang Shao, Lijing Shao, Changfu Shi, Shuo Sun, Anzhong Wang, Pan-Pan Wang, Sai Wang, Shao-Jiang Wang, Zhong-Zhi Xianyu, Huan Yang, Tao Yang, Jian-dong Zhang, Xin Zhang, Wen Zhao, Liang-Gui Zhu, Jianwei Mei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20138v1)

**Summary:**

The space-based gravitational wave detector TianQin will tune in to gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency range. It will open a new gravitational wave spectrum window to explore many of the previously hidden sectors of the universe. The plethora of information collected will bring us to new fronts on which to search for the breaking points of general relativity, the possible violation of established physical laws, the signature of possible new gravitational physics and new fundamental fields. The discoveries will improve our knowledge on the expansion history of the universes.

## 10. Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Modified Gravity

**Authors:** Anjali Abirami Kugarajh, Marisol Traforetti, Andrea Maselli, Sabino Matarrese, Angelo Ricciardone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20137v1)

**Summary:**

 Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) are expected to contribute to the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) potentially detectable by current and future gravitational wave interferometers. In the framework of GR, this SGWB represents an unavoidable contribution to the gravitational wave spectrum. In this paper, we go beyond GR and we investigate the behavior of SIGWs in f(R) gravity. Our results indicate that the beyond-GR correction leaves an observational imprint, mainly in the low-frequency part of the spectrum.

## 11. Rotating Casimir Wormholes

**Authors:** Remo Garattini, Athanasios G. Tzikas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19995v1)

**Summary:**

A Casimir Wormhole is a Traversable Wormhole powered by a Casimir energy source within a static reference frame. A natural extension of this system is the inclusion of rotation. We will explore two basic configurations: one with radially varying Casimir plates and another with parametrically fixed plates. In both cases, we will show that rotations do not alter the structure of aCasimir wormhole and the behavior observed in a static frame is reaffirmed. The consistency of the Einstein Field Equations is ensured with the help of an additional source without an accompanying energy density.

## 12. Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius

**Authors:** Jungjai Lee, Yongjun Yun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880v1)

**Summary:**

We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model with a scalar torsion $phi$ under the assumption of no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We show that the accelerating expansion can occur by setting the IR cut-off to the Hubble radius as $L=H^{-1}$ with the Hubble parameter $H$. Motivated by two physical choices based on Friedmann equations and the holographic principle, tellingly, spin-induced torsions occur at non-zero matter density.

## 13. Slowly rotating black hole in chiral scalar-tensor theory

**Authors:** Ze-Kai Yu, Lei Liu, Tao Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19836v1)

**Summary:**

The chiral scalar-tensor theory is an extension of the Chern-Simons modified gravity. It introduces couplings between the first and second derivatives of the scalar field and parity-violating spacetime curvatures. A key feature of this theory is its explicit breaking of parity symmetry in the gravitational sector. In the weak limit, we find that the effects of parity violation are suppressed in the weak field but could become significant in the strong field regime. The results may be used for further investigations into its observational signatures.
