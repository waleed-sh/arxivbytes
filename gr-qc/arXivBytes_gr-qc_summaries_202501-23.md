## 0. A Non-linear Massive Gravity Theory of Geometric Origin

**Authors:** Thibault Damour, Tamanna Jain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13077v1)

**Summary:**

We study the number of propagating degrees of freedom, at non-linear order, in torsion gravity theories. We focus on a three-parameter subfamily of theories (``torsion bigravity") that contains, at linear order, only two physical excitations. We study the dynamics of the massive spin-2 field in the limit where the torsional field decouples from the metric. The number of degrees offreedom of the torion field is found to change, atNon-linear Order, from five to nine.

## 1. Effective-one-body model for coalescing binary neutron stars:   Incorporating tidal spin and enhanced radiation from dynamical tides

**Authors:** Hang Yu, Shu Yan Lau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13064v1)

**Summary:**

Tidal interactions in a coalescing binary neutron star (BNS) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) system contain precious information about physics. In the late inspiral stage, where the tidal effects are the strongest, dynamical corrections to the tidal response become significant. We present an effective-one-body (EOB) waveform model for BNSs and NSBHs incorporating the tidal spin, particularly its reaction to the orbit due to the Newtonian tidal torque and the relativistic orbital hang-up.

## 2. GRTresna: An open-source code to solve the initial data constraints in   numerical relativity

**Authors:** Josu C. Aurrekoetxea, Sam E. Brady, Llibert Aresté-Saló, Jamie Bamber, Liina Chung-Jukko, Katy Clough, Eloy de Jong, Matthew Elley, Pau Figueras, Thomas Helfer, Eugene A. Lim, Miren Radia, Areef Waeming, Zipeng Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13046v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13046v1)

**Summary:**

GRTresna is a multigrid solver designed to solve the constraint equations for the initial data required in numerical relativity simulations. In particular it is focussed on scenarios with fundamental fields around black holes and inhomogeneous cosmological spacetimes. The code is based on the formalism in Aurrekoetxea, Clough \& Lim arXiv:2207.03125 and can be found at https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration.

## 3. Probing the Quantum Nature of Gravity through Diffusion

**Authors:** Oliviero Angeli, Sandro Donadi, Giovanni Di Bartolomeo, José Luis Gaona-Reyes, Andrea Vinante, Angelo Bassi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13030v1)

**Summary:**

The quest to determine whether gravity is quantum has challenged physicists since the mid 20th century. The difficulty of preparing and controlling large quantum states has hindered practical progress. We present an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from complex quantum state manipulation to the simpler observation of a probe's motion. By proving that a classical and local gravitational field must inherently display randomness to interact consistently with quantum matter, we show that this randomness induces measurable diffusion. This diffusion serves as a distinctive signature of classical gravity coupling to quantum matter.

## 4. Euclidean AdS wormholes and gravitational instantons in the   Einstein-Skyrme theory

**Authors:** Fabrizio Canfora, Cristóbal Corral, Borja Diez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13024v1)

**Summary:**

Euclidean AdS wormholes provide a natural setup for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence with multiple boundaries. However, they cannot be embedded in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Maxwell theory if these boundaries have positive curvature. Maldacena and Maoz showed that this obstruction could be circumvented by introducing merons in the 4D Einstein- AdS-Yang-Mills theory. Other topologically nontrivial ground states in Einstein-Skyrme theory are found.

## 5. Barrow entropies in black hole thermodynamics

**Authors:** Salvatore Capozziello, Mehdi Shokri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12987v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12987v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermodynamic features of static, spherically-symmetric Schwarzschild black holes. We consider a logarithmic-corrected type of this entropy by taking into account some loop quantum gravity effects. We investigate the black hole thermodynamics from the viewpoint of Barrow entropy in presence of non-extensivity effects coming from the Tsallis statistics. Finally, we compare the results obtained for different Barrow-based entropies. The study was published in the Journal of Black Hole Theory.

## 6. A note on Strong Cosmic Censorship and its violation in   Reissner-Nordström de Sitter black hole space-times

**Authors:** Anna Chrysostomou, Alan S. Cornell, Aldo Deandrea, Seong Chan Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12968v1)

**Summary:**

Penrose's Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture safeguards determinism in General Relativity. For the Kerr-Newman family of black hole solutions, this requires the inextendability of the metric past the Cauchy horizon. We study the consequent role of quasinormal mode behaviour and illustrate the parameter space for which we consistently observe violations of the conjecture within Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black holes. In this note, we review some of the arguments for and against the conjecture.

## 7. The impact of hyperons on neutron star mergers: gravitational waves,   mass ejection and black hole formation

**Authors:** Hristijan Kochankovski, Georgios Lioutas, Sebastian Blacker, Andreas Bauswein, Angels Ramos, Laura Tolos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12905v1)

**Summary:**

Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs.

## 8. The late-time heating Green's function and improvements to distortion   frequency hierarchy treatment

**Authors:** Sara Evangelista, Jens Chluba, Francesco Pace

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12822v1)

**Summary:**

Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.

## 9. Comparison of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes in $f(\mathbb{T})$ and   $f(\mathbb{Q})$ Gravity

**Authors:** Zhen-Xiao Zhang, Chen Lan, Yan-Gang Miao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12800v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes in vacuum. Based on the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, the gravitational effects arise from non-metricity (the covariant derivative of metrics) in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. This variation demonstrates the impact of different parameter values. These results provide the theoretical groundwork for assessing alternative gravities' viability through gravitational wave data, and aid probably in picking out the alternative gravity theory that best aligns with the empirical reality.

## 10. Stability of fluids in spacetimes with decelerated expansion

**Authors:** David Fajman, Maximilian Ofner, Todd Oliynyk, Zoe Wyatt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12798v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12798v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the nonlinear stability of homogeneous barotropic perfect fluid solutions in fixed cosmological spacetimes undergoing decelerated expansion. The results hold provided a specific inequality between the speed of sound of the fluid and the expansion rate of spacetime is valid. Our proof relies on an energy functional which is universal in the sense that it also applies to the case of linear expansion and enables a significantly simplified proof of bounds for fluids on linearly expanding spacetime. Finally, we consider the special cases of dust and radiation fluids in the de slowed regime and prove shock formation for arbitrarily small perturbations of homogenous solutions.

## 11. Trajectories of light beams in a Kerr metric: the influence of the   rotation of an observer on the shadow of a black hole

**Authors:** Ivan Bizyaev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12663v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the trajectories of light beams in a Kerr metric, which describes the gravitational field in the neighborhood of a rotating black hole. After reduction by cyclic coordinates, this problem reduces to analysis of a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. Relations describing the boundary of the shadow of the black hole are obtained for a stationary observer who rotates with an arbitrary angular velocity. A bifurcation diagram is constructed and a classification is made of the types of trajectory of the system according to the values of first integrals.

## 12. Inferring the cosmological constant in early Universe only by   gravitational waves

**Authors:** Song Li, Wen-Biao Han

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12608v1)

**Summary:**

The expansion of the Universe is accelerating which can be interpreted as due to the cosmological constant. We rigorously analyze the merger rate of binary primordial black holes (PBHs) and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio within the framework of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) We find that binary PBHs with a total mass of $M._{\mathrm{tot}}=1000M_{\odot}$ and a redshift larger than $z=500$ are the ideal system for studying the effect of thecosmological Constant.

## 13. Rotating black holes in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity:   Newman-Janis Algorithm

**Authors:** Ping Li, Jiang-he Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12586v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12586v1)

**Summary:**

We report the discovery of rotating black hole solutions within the framework of de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. We demonstrate that any nonunitary gauge with the Minkowski reference metric are equal to a unitary gauge with some curved reference metric. We explain how to obtain a static, spherically symmetric solution and then transform it into the corresponding rotating black Hole using the Newman-Janis algorithm. For the first time, we provide an analytic expression for a hairy black hole that can reduce to the non-rotating case.

## 14. Analysis of the cosmological evolution parameters, energy conditions,   and linear matter perturbations of an exponential-type model in $f(Q)$   gravity

**Authors:** Ivan R. Vasquez, A. Oliveros

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12585v1)

**Summary:**

We study cosmological evolution in a flat FLRW spacetime in the context of modified STEGR gravity or $f(Q)$, using an exponential two-parameter model. The Hubble parameter is obtained analytically by means of several approximations good enough to deviate slightly from the $Lambda$CDM case. The overall results indicate that the model may exhibit quintessence-like and phantom-like behavior and it impacts the growth of structures in the universe.

## 15. On Equation of State of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes

**Authors:** Zhong-Ming Xie, Yong Tang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12574v1)

**Summary:**

The nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains mysterious despite the substantial evidence from astrophysical and cosmological observations. While the majority of DM in our universe is non-relativistic, collisionless and its equation of state (EoS) is approximately pressureless $p\simeq 0$, DM becomes relativistic near the massive black holes in galactic center. We show that DM can have static profiles near black holes and its pressure should be negative in order to support the viable density profiles.

## 16. Black hole in the Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile

**Authors:** Ali Övgün, Reggie C. Pantig

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12559v1)

**Summary:**

The new black hole solution is surrounded by a Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile. The shadow radius scales linearly with black hole mass, while higher central densities result in smaller shadows, reflecting the environmental impact of dense dark matter halos. The findings ensure consistency with general relativity in vacuum. This work highlights the significance dark matter profiles in shaping black hole observables, providing a theoretical foundation for future observational studies and advancing the understanding of dark matter-black hole interactions in astrophysical and cosmological contexts.
