## 0. Estimating the mass of the thin shell of gravastars in generalised   cylindrically symmetric space-time within the framework of Rastall theory of   gravity

**Authors:** Debadri Bhattacharjee, Pradip Kumar Chattopadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08745v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates the gravastars in the framemwork of Rastall theory of gravity in generalised cylindrically symmetric space-time. Following the Mazur-Mottola hypothesis (P. O. Mazur and E. Mottola, Universe {\bf 9}, 88 (2023), gravastar are classified as one of the most unique and exotic kind of compact objects. We have ensured singularity-free solutions for the interior de-Sitter core, non-vanishing solutions of the thin shell and flat vacuum solution of the exterior region.

## 1. Gravitational signatures of a nonlinear electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$   gravity

**Authors:** A. A. Araújo Filho, N. Heidari, I. P. Lobo, V. B. Bezerra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08718v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate a nonlinear electrodynamics model within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. We begin by outlining the general features of the theory and analyzing the event horizon under conditions ensuring its real and positive definiteness. We then examine light trajectories, focusing on critical orbits, shadow radii, and geodesics of massless particles. Finally, we examine additional topological aspects, including topological thermodynamics and the topological photon sphere.

## 2. Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth   radiation bounce

**Authors:** Federico Piazza, Siméon Vareilles

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703v1)

**Summary:**

We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum cosmology. We propose restricting to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model highlights a bouncing behavior. We argue that the inevitable time dependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de Sitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch of radiation domination near the singularity.

## 3. Comments on the de Sitter Double Cone

**Authors:** Zhenbin Yang, Yuzhen Zhang, Wenwen Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08647v1)

**Summary:**

We study the double cone geometry proposed by Saad, Shenker, and Stanford in de Sitter space. We demonstrate that with the inclusion of static patch observers, thedouble cone leads to a linear ramp consistent with random matrix behavior. This ramp arises from the relative time shift between two clocks located in opposite static patches. We show that the linear ramp is consistent with the behavior of a random matrix. We present our results in a paper published in the Journal of Mathematical Theory and Mechanics.

## 4. Probing the Universe's Topology through a Quantum System?

**Authors:** Evangelos Achilleas Paraskevas, Leandros Perivolaropoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08603v1)

**Summary:**

The global topology of the Universe could, in principle, affect quantum systems through boundary condition constraints. We investigate how compact, flat, cosmologically inspired topologies influence the energy eigenvalues of a quantum particle in the bound state of a 3D Dirac delta potential. Using the three dimensional Dirac potential as a toy model, we show that at the current cosmic epoch ($a=1$), these topological effects are exponentially suppressed. Such effects may become measurable in the early Universe, when the physical size of the particle horizon is comparable to the characteristic scale of the quantum system.

## 5. Long-Lived Quasinormal Modes and Quasi-Resonances around Non-Minimal   Einstein-Yang-Mills Black Holes

**Authors:** Alexey Dubinsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08545v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the quasinormal frequencies of a massive scalar field propagating near a black hole in the framework of non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a non-zero cosmological constant. We show that increasing the mass of the field significantly decreases the damping rate for both asymptotically flat and de Sitter black holes. In the limit of quasi-resonances, we observe a kind of universal behavior where the frequencies do not depend on the coupling constant.

## 6. Wormholes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Bose-Einstein   Condensated Dark Matter

**Authors:** Bibhash Das, Bikash Chandra Paul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08481v1)

**Summary:**

In the paper, we obtain a spherically symmetric traversable wormhole (WH) in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity with Bose-Einstein condensated (BEC) dark matter. We analyse the embedding diagram of the WH obtained here with the study of the proper radial distance, volume integral quantifier, and anisotropy measurement in this model. The vanishing sound speed in the model is analyzed, and found that the WH is stable at the throat for $0.0512471.

## 7. The matter with(in) CPL

**Authors:** Leonardo Giani, Rodrigo Von Marttens, Oliver Fabio Piattella

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08467v1)

**Summary:**

We use data from DESI DR2 BAO, DESY5 Sn~Ia and CMB distance priors. We compare our model with the standard CPL parameterization $w_0-w_a$ for dynamical dark energy. We discuss how this parameterization finds a natural interpretation in the context of cosmological backreaction. We derive a prediction for the evolution of the growth factor, discussing its impact on low redshift $f\sigma_8$ measurements.

## 8. Graviton-photon conversion in blazar jets as a probe of high-frequency   gravitational waves

**Authors:** Himeka Matsuo, Asuka Ito

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08457v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08457v1)

**Summary:**

We study graviton-photon conversion in the magnetic fields of a blazar jet and explore the possibility of detecting high-frequency gravitational waves through blazar observations. We calculate the conversion rate using the magnetic field configurations of leptonic, lepto-hadronic, and hadronic one-zone synchrotron self-Compton models. We find that, for all three models considered, the resulting limits can be more stringent than previous constraints in the frequency range from $10^8$ Hz to $10^{15}$ Hz.

## 9. Quasinormal modes for coherent quantum black holes

**Authors:** Tommaso Antonelli, Andrea Giusti, Roberto Casadio, Lavinia Heisenberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08415v1)

**Summary:**

Coherent quantum black holes are quantum geometries obtained by means of a mean-field-like approach to the gravitational interaction. This procedure attenuates the classical spacetime singularities of general relativity by replacing them with integrable singularities in the quantum-corrected geometry. The results indicate potential deviations from general relativity, the magnitude of which is gauged by the value of the ultraviolet regulator of the model (physically identifiable as a matter core) Observations of the ringdown phase in black hole mergers could help detect such deviations.

## 10. Periapsis shift in magnetized stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes

**Authors:** Yuhan Zhou, Junji Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08412v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08412v1)

**Summary:**

The magnetic field is found to enhance (or decrease) the periapsis shift when the Lorentz force is attractive (or repulsive) When the repulsive force is strong enough, the shift can become negative. The results for the dipolar magnetic field are applied to Mercury around the Sun and the S2 around the Sgr A* to constrain the dipole moment of the center and the charge of the orbiting object. It is found using the PN method for magnetic fields decaying as fast or faster than a magnetic dipole that the magnetic effect appears from the same order of the traditional frame-dragging term.

## 11. Observational constraints on the Kerr and its several single-parameter   modified spacetimes using quasi-periodic oscillation data

**Authors:** Shining Yang, Jianbo Lu, Wenmei Li, Mou Xu, Jingyang Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08409v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the dynamical effects of particles moving in the Kerr spacetime. Using quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) observational data, we constrain the free parameters of the ten spacetimes. Only the KN spacetime yields a modification parameter constraint spanning both negative and positive values. The Bayesian factor analysis indicates that the ABG, Hayward, KN, BK, and Kerr-MOG spacetime have a slight advantage over the Kerr solution. In contrast, the AIC analysis shows that the Kerr model remains the optimal model under the current QPO data.

## 12. Influence of density-dependent bag function $B(n)$ on strange stars for   non-zero strange quark mass ($m_s\neq0$) in $f(R,T)$ gravity consistent with   observational validation

**Authors:** Rohit Roy, Debadri Bhattacharjee, Pradip Kumar Chattopadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08379v1)

**Summary:**

In this work a new class of solution of Einstein field equation for isotropic strange star using Mak and Harko density profile is presented. The energy per baryon ($E_B) has been investigated to restrict $B(n)$ within stable window. The proposed model has been shown to comply with the required energy conditions and satisfies the criterion for dynamical stability. It has been observed that all the essential characteristics are satisfactorily fulfilled within the stellar interior for the selected set of parameter space.

## 13. Weakly modeled search for compact binary coalescences in the Einstein   Telescope

**Authors:** Adrian Macquet, Tito Dal Canton, Tania Regimbau

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08377v1)

**Summary:**

We search for gravitational-wave (GW) signals from compact binary coalescences (CBC) in the $2024$ mock data challenge of the Einstein Telescope (ET) with a detection algorithm that does not rely on the waveform of the signal searched. With the increased sensitivity of ET compared to current GW detectors, a very high rate of detectable sources is expected in the data. We explore the behavior of a weakly modeled search algorithm which is intrinsically less sensitive than optimal search methods based on matched filtering techniques, but computationally much cheaper.

## 14. Improving the detection significance of gravitational wave transient   searches with CNN models

**Authors:** Johann Fernandes, Archana Pai, Koustav Chandra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08332v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave (GW) transient searches rely on signal-noise discriminators to distinguish astrophysical signals from noise artefacts. We use a Convolutional Neural Network-based approach to classify noise transients from astrophysical transients. Our approach improves the sensitive volume-time reach of these searches by approximately 30% at a false alarm rate of once per 100 years. In particular, we significantly improve the first IMBH binary GW event GW190521 with an IFAR exceeding 42000 years.

## 15. Black hole interiors in the thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity

**Authors:** Valerio Faraoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08322v1)

**Summary:**

The thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity is an analogy with a dissipative fluid. We extend this thermal analogy to the interior region near the singularity of spherical, vacuum, uncharged black holes. The discussion is then extended to black holes in the presence of perfect or imperfect fluids with constant equation of state -- the latter determines whether Einstein gravity is approached or not. The singularity is ``hot'', meaning that gravity diverges from general relativity. The conclusion is that Einstein gravity cannot be approached in this way.

## 16. Against Radical Relationalism: in Defense of the Ordinal Structure of   Time

**Authors:** Álvaro Mozota Frauca

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08307v1)

**Summary:**

Some authors in the quantum gravity community endorse, explicitly or implicitly, a radical relationalist view of time. In this article I analyze this position and the arguments supporting it. I argue that there are some serious concerns with some of the radical relationalists' arguments which make it an unattractive position. I conclude that the chrono-ordinal structures of our theories play important theoretical and explanatory roles and that they can be taken to be part of the empirical content ofour theories. The article was originally published on The Conversation.

## 17. Observational tests for a class of scalar-tensor gravity

**Authors:** Kunio Kaneta, Kin-ya Oda, Motohiko Yoshimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08286v1)

**Summary:**

We study observational bounds in a class of scalar-tensor gravity theories recently proposed. Either an upper or lower bound on a conformal factor in these theories is derived from null observation in composition dependent fifth force search, microscope mission. The important case of a lower bound implies that future improved observations have chances of verifying this class of theories. Future prospect for a particular type of observation is mentioned. The considered class of gravity was shown elsewhere to explain the conversion of inflationary early phase to late time quintessence type dark energy.

## 18. Phase-space analysis of an anisotropic universe in $f(Q,C)$ gravity

**Authors:** Ghulam Murtaza, Avik De, Tee-How Loo, Yong Kheng Goh, How Hui Liew

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08274v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we analyze the anisotropic universe in $f(Q,C)$ gravity theory. We identify and analyze the critical points, examine their stability, and plot phase portraits to illustrate the behavior of each critical point. The evolution of key parameters, including the equation of state (EoS) and the deceleration parameter $q$ is thoroughly investigated. The an isotropic dynamical variable exhibits decelerated behavior, consistent with the early universe, while the others demonstrate accelerated behavior, aligned with late-time observations.

## 19. Quintessence Dark Matter

**Authors:** Deng Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08154v1)

**Summary:**

We propose the quintessence dark matter model to explain the evolution of dark matter over time on cosmic scales. Interestingly, we find that the exponential quintessences is likely the origin of such an evolution. We give the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of dynamical dark matter and beyond $2,000,000$ using current cosmological observations. We conclude that this model is the most likely way to explain dark matter's evolution over time. The model can be used to predict the existence of dark energy and dark matter.

## 20. White dwarfs in regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity

**Authors:** Juan M. Z. Pretel, Takol Tangphati, İzzet Sakallı, Ayan Banerjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08153v1)

**Summary:**

White dwarfs (WDs) provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between quantum mechanical degeneracy pressure and gravitational forces under extreme conditions. We examine the structure and macroscopic properties of WDs within the framework of 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. We observe that such stars become more compact and slightly smaller with the increase of the parameter $\alpha$. For WDs with $M-R$ the impact of 4DEGB gravity appears to be negligible.
