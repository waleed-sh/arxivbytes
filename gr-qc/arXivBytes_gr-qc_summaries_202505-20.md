## 0. Unified nonparametric equation-of-state inference from the neutron-star   crust to perturbative-QCD densities

**Authors:** Eliot Finch, Isaac Legred, Katerina Chatziioannou, Reed Essick, Sophia Han, Phillippe Landry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13691v1)

**Summary:**

Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) could provide constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) We examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs) We find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\sim 0.5$ at the $90\%$ level. We do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables.

## 1. On the Present Status of Inflationary Cosmology

**Authors:** Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13646v1)

**Summary:**

We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory. We discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors. We describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data. We also describe the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s]$ and $r$..

## 2. Spectrum of BPS black holes in $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$

**Authors:** Matthew Heydeman, Xiaoyi Shi, Gustavo J. Turiaci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13618v1)

**Summary:**

We uncover novel features in the spectrum of BPS and near-BPS states in asymptotically $AdS_3 $ spacetimes. This follows from a careful analysis of semiclassical and quantum black holes in this theory. We construct a family of non-extremal supersymmetric black holes that contribute to a supersymmetry index yet possess a temperature-dependent free energy. Analogous results apply to six-dimensional black holes with near-horizon geometries constructed in M-theory compactifications.

## 3. Constraints are not enough

**Authors:** Gary T. Horowitz, Donald Marolf, Jorge E. Santos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13600v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13600v1)

**Summary:**

The Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action is well-known to be unbounded below. A variety of works since the late 1980's have suggested that this problem disappears when one fixes a foliation of the spacetime and imposes the corresponding gravitational constraints. We show that this approach fails with various classes of boundary conditions imposed on the foliation. We also discuss the idea of fixing the scalar curvature and Wick-rotating the conformal factor, and show that it also fails to produce an action bounded from below.

## 4. Modeling Galaxy Surveys with Hybrid SBI

**Authors:** Gemma Zhang, Chirag Modi, Oliver H. E. Philcox

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13591v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13591v1)

**Summary:**

Simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys deep into the non-linear regime. Despite its great promise, its application is limited by the computational cost of running simulations. Recent work proposed a hybrid SBI framework (HySBI), which combines SBI on small-scales with perturbation theory (PT) on large-sc scales. HySBI can obtain 20\% and 60\% tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, respectively, compared to traditional PT analyses.

## 5. Wonderings on Wiggly Bispectra: Non-linear Evolution and Reconstruction   of Oscillations in the Squeezed Bispectrum

**Authors:** Samuel Goldstein, Oliver H. E. Philcox, Emanuele Fondi, William R. Coulton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13443v1)

**Summary:**

Oscillations in the primordial bispectrum are sourced by a range of inflationary phenomena, including features in the inflaton potential and interactions with massive fields through the Cosmological Collider scenario. These signatures offer a powerful window into early-universe physics. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions, we show that non-linear evolution significantly damps these oscillations. Our findings pave the way for future searches for oscillatory bispectra using large-scale structure data.

## 6. On modified Hawking radiation under quantum gravity effects in the   fermion sector

**Authors:** Ivan P-Castro, Héctor Aguilera-Trujillo, Hugo García-Compeán, Abdel Pérez-Lorenzana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13423v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13423v1)

**Summary:**

Special care must be taken when computing temperature corrections in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation. We present a consistent implementation of such corrections in static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) spacetimes. We also determined the changes in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Schwarzschild BHs, including corrections from LIV scenarios. The results show that introducing terms that increase/decrease the energy in the dispersion relation--originally determined by LorentZ invariance--leads to a corresponding increase in the Hawking temperature.

## 7. Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Samuel Sánchez López, José Jaime Terente Díaz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum. The spectrum could provide information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. The spectral density may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational wave experiments. It is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. The potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.

**Authors:** Mark A. Scheel, Michael Boyle, Keefe Mitman, Nils Deppe, Leo C. Stein, Cristóbal Armaza, Marceline S. Bonilla, Luisa T. Buchman, Andrea Ceja, Himanshu Chaudhary, Yitian Chen, Maxence Corman, Károly Zoltán Csukás, C. Melize Ferrus, Scott E. Field, Matthew Giesler, Sarah Habib, François Hébert, Daniel A. Hemberger, Dante A. B. Iozzo, Tousif Islam, Ken Z. Jones, Aniket Khairnar, Lawrence E. Kidder, Taylor Knapp, Prayush Kumar, Guillermo Lara, Oliver Long, Geoffrey Lovelace, Sizheng Ma, Denyz Melchor, Marlo Morales, Jordan Moxon, Peter James Nee, Kyle C. Nell, Eamonn O'Shea, Serguei Ossokine, Robert Owen, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Isabella G. Pretto, Teresita Ramirez-Aguilar, Antoni Ramos-Buades, Adhrit Ravichandran, Abhishek Ravishankar, Samuel Rodriguez, Hannes R. Rüter, Jennifer Sanchez, Md Arif Shaikh, Dongze Sun, Béla Szilágyi, Daniel Tellez, Saul A. Teukolsky, Sierra Thomas, William Throwe, Vijay Varma, Nils L. Vu, Marissa Walker, Nikolas A. Wittek, Jooheon Yoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13378v1)

**Summary:**

We present a major update to the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) Collaboration's catalog of binary black hole simulations. Using highly efficient spectral methods implemented in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), we have nearly doubled the total number of binary configurations. We estimate the total CPU cost of all simulations in the catalog to be 480,000,000 core-hours. The full catalog is publicly available through the sxs Python package and at https://data.black-holes.org .

## 9. Signature change as phase transition in holography

**Authors:** Marcelo Botta Cantcheff

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13349v1)

**Summary:**

In holographic quantum gravity, Euclidean pieces of the spacetime appear in the large N limit as representing semi-classical states of the theory. In this essay, we argue that the duals of entangled states are spacetime geometries that contain Euclideans regions in order to preserve classical connectivity. Thereby, the proposal is to extend the ER-EPR conjecture to regimes whether wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridges) become unstable but the entangled structure of the dual state persists.

## 10. Polarization modes of gravitational waves in general symmetric   teleparallel gravity

**Authors:** Yu-Qi Dong, Xiao-Bin Lai, Yu-Zhi Fan, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13298v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the polarization modes of gravitational waves within the most general symmetric teleparallel gravity theory. We consider both scenarios where test particles either carry or do not carry a hypermomentum charge. The study reveals that, within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework, it is crucial to assume that matter fields are independent of the connection, as any dependence would lead to unphysical results. We also analyze the polarization mode in two widely studied special theories: $f-Q theory and quadratic non-metricity theory.

## 11. Black Holes with Global Monopoles in 4D Noncommutative Einstein Gauss   Bonnet Gravity

**Authors:** B. Hamil

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13286v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we construct an exact spherically symmetric black hole solution with a global monopole in the context of noncommutative Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We also analyze thermodynamics and thermal stability by computing the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. The heat capacity exhibits divergences that signal second-order phase transitions. Finally, we analyze quasinormal modes or scalar perturbations, we compute them via the 6th-order WKB method, and compare them to the shadow radius methods in the eikonal limit.

## 12. Observational Signatures of Janis-Newman-Winicour Strongly Naked   Singularity

**Authors:** Zeqian Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13214v1)

**Summary:**

This paper explores the unique observational signatures of accretion onto a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) strongly naked singularity, particularly in the absence of a photon sphere. The surrounding spacetime of such a singularity exhibits pronounced reflective properties, causing light rays traveling in its vicinity to undergo reflection. Our simulations reveal that this reflection effect generates additional images in the gravitational lensing patterns and significantly alters the temporal brightness profiles of the lensed images. These reflection-induced paired images, together with their inclination-dependent behavior, offer distinct observational signatures that could potentially distinguish a JNW strongly nakedsingity from a black hole.

## 13. Fractional Einstein field equations in $2+1$ dimensional spacetime

**Authors:** E. Contreras, A. Di Teodoro, M. Mena

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13121v1)

**Summary:**

A new fractional derivative modifies the conventional Riemann-Liouville operator to obtain a set of fractional Einstein field equations within a 2+1 dimensional spacetime. The key innovation of the new operator ensures that the derivative of a constant is zero. For values of the fractional parameter close to one, the effective matter sector corresponds to a charged BTZ solution with an anisotropic cosmological constant. As a particular application, we explore whether the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole metric is a solution to fractionsal Einstein equations.

## 14. Linear analysis of I-C-Love universal relations for neutron stars

**Authors:** Zexin Hu, Yong Gao, Lijing Shao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13110v1)

**Summary:**

Neutron stars (NSs) are excellent laboratories for testing gravity theories as they are strongly self-gravitating bodies. Strong-gravity effects in NS could be degenerate with their equation of state (EOS) which is largely unknown. Fortunately, there exist the so-called universal relations among the NS macroscopic quantities that are found to be insensitive to the underlying EOS. Studying the origin of these relations can lead to a better understanding of NSs and the gravitational interaction.

## 15. Thermodynamic parameters of fluids on conformally connected spacetimes

**Authors:** Bhera Ram, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13084v1)

**Summary:**

Local thermal equilibrium generally implies the absence of heat flux within a fluid. We find the relations between a set of thermodynamic variables of a fluid on a general spacetime and those defined on a conformally connected spacetime. The scaling relations appear to be consistent with Dicke's heuristic argument and the previous analysis done on the basis of various restrictions. These relations are further shown to preserve the geometric structure of thermodynamics, known as geometrothermodynamics. This provides an alternative consistency check as well as a distinct geometric interpretation of the relations.

## 16. Hamiltonian renormalisation IX. U(1)**3 quantum gravity

**Authors:** M. Rodriguez Zarate, T. Thiemann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13037v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonian renormalisation of the U(1)**3 model for Euclidian general relativity in four spacetime dimensions which is self-interacting. The Hamiltonian flow needs as an input a choice of *-algebra and corresponding representation thereof or state on it at each resolution scale. If one uses as input the algebras and states that were used in the recent exact solutions of this model, then one finds that the flow is rapidly fixed pointed. In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormisation of free field theories in all spacetime Dimensions.

## 17. Hamiltonian renormalisation VIII. P(Phi,2) quantum field theory

**Authors:** M. Rodriguez Zarate, T. Thiemann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13030v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the self-interacting scalar field in two spacetime dimensions with polynomial potential. We consider only the finite volume case. The P(Phi,2) theory is one of the few interacting QFT's that can be rigorously constructed non-perturbatively. We find that our Hamiltonianrenormalisation flow finds this theory indeed as a fixed point. In previous works in this series we focussed on the renormalization of free field theories in all spacetime Dimensions.

## 18. Characterizing geodesic deviations in a Topological Star spacetime:   massive, charged, spinning and stringy-like objects

**Authors:** Donato Bini, Giorgio Di Russo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13020v1)

**Summary:**

We study deviations from geodesic motions in a Topological Star spacetime for either massive, charged and spinning particles. We also consider the deviations for the motion of electrically charged stringy probes in $D=5$, framing all cases within a unified picture.

## 19. The Luminosity of the Darkness: Schechter function in dark sirens

**Authors:** Cezary Turski, Maria Lisa Brozzetti, Gergely Dálya, Michele Punturo, Archisman Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13568v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a novel avenue for probing the Universe. One of their exciting applications is the independent measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$ using dark standard sirens. However, due to the limited reach of telescopes, galaxy catalogues are incomplete at high redshifts. The commonly used GLADE+ is complete only up to redshift $z=0.1$, necessitating a model accounting for the galaxy luminosity distribution. This model is typically described by the Schechter function.

## 20. Stark Energy Shifts due to Quantum Gravity in RGUP Algebra

**Authors:** Gaurav Bhandari, S. D. Pathak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12985v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the Stark effect in the hydrogen atom under an external electric field. We incorporate relativistic generalized uncertainty principle (RGUP) corrections within Minkowskian spacetime. The perturbed Hamiltonian, modified by RGUP, enfold quantum gravitational effects. These findings reduce to standard Stark effect results and non-relativistic GUP frameworks in the limits of the GUP framework. We establish our model as a generalized framework for analyzing minimal length effects in quantum systems.

## 21. Classical and Quantum cosmology for two scalar field Brans-Dicke type   theory: A Noether Symmetry approach

**Authors:** Shriton Hembrom, Roshni Bhaumik, Sourav Dutta, Subenoy Chakraborty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12984v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12984v1)

**Summary:**

The paper deals with a cosmological model containing two scalar fields which can be considered as an extension of the Brans-Dicke scalar field model. Due to highly coupled non linear field equations, Noether Symmetry analysis has been imposed and as a result the Lagrangian as well as the field equations become much simple in form to have the classical solutions. Finally, quantum cosmology has been studied by constructing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the solution of this second order partial differential equation has been done.

## 22. What Price Fiber Bundle Substantivalism? On How to Avoid Holes in Fibers

**Authors:** Philipp Berghofer, Jordan François, Lucrezia Ravera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876v1)

**Summary:**

Gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories are formulated in a framework based on the differential geometry of connections on principal bundles. After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories. It formally implements the point- coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (d dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.

## 23. The polynomial potential inflation in light of ACT observations

**Authors:** Zhi-Zhang Peng, Zu-Cheng Chen, Lang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12816v1)

**Summary:**

Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data. In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data. We find that the cubic model can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Our findings show that higher-order polynictional potentials remain viable for describing cosmic inflation.

## 24. Holographic composite Higgs model and gravitational waves produced   during first order phase transition

**Authors:** Andrey A. Shavrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12773v1)

**Summary:**

The soft-wall holographic composite Higgs model assumes first-order phase transition from the dynamical inner symmetry breaking. This research focuses on the implications of the semi-analytical perturbative solution of the dual 5-dimensional theory. We clarify the thermodynamical description and gravitational waves spectrum produced during the phase transition, which were previously numerically estimated. Besides, we investigate the limits of the applicability of our solution within the thin-wall approximation and quasiclassical approach.

## 25. Super-entropic black holes in gravity's rainbow and determining   constraints on rainbow functions

**Authors:** Behzad Eslam Panah, Narges Heidari, Mana Soleimani, Maryam Kaveh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13555v1)

**Summary:**

This paper is motivated by the application of the inverse isoperimetric inequality to establish constraints on the parameters of gravity's rainbow. We investigate the thermodynamic (in)stability conditions for $d-$dimensional energy-dependent black holes. By considering a constraint on the rainbow function, we show that these black holes satisfy the super-entropic condition. We assess the physical and stable regions by utilizing these thermodynamic quantities alongside the inverting isoperiative inequality, aiming to determine constraints on rainbow functions.

## 26. Alternative Action for Generalized Unimodular Gravity

**Authors:** Dmitry Nesterov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13548v1)

**Summary:**

We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG) The action for this formulation is derived constructively through a sequence of equivalent representations. A notable consequence of the consistent parametrization is the emergence of explicit spatial delocalization in the action. We identify a subfamily of models described by a local action. While preserving the essential structural features, these models avoid the complications of spatial nonlocality allowing a clearer analysis. The dynamical and constraint structures of GUMG family models are different from those of UMG, however the latter appears as an exceptional special case within the family.

## 27. Measuring the cosmic dipole with golden dark sirens in the era of   next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors

**Authors:** Anson Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12678v1)

**Summary:**

Tensions between cosmological parameter measurements from the early-universe and the late-Universe datasets offer an exciting opportunity to explore new physics, if not accounted for. As a new and powerful tool, gravitational waves can serve as an independent probe to the cosmic dipole. A useful type of events to achieve this is the "golden dark sirens", which are near-by well-localized compact binary coalescences whose host galaxies can be identified directly due to precise localization. The standard LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors are not able to detect a meaningful amount of golden dark siren.
