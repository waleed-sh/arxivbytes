## 0. Cosmological perturbations meet Wheeler DeWitt

**Authors:** Federico Piazza, Siméon Vareilles

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782v1)

**Summary:**

We study solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation in order to recover standard results of cosmological perturbation theory. In mini-superspace, we introduce a dimensionless gravitational coupling that is typically very small. By using the semiclassical limit we express the relation between the wavefunction of the universe and the perturbative wavefunction. We discuss possible deviations from the classical background trajectory as well as the higher derivative terms that are present in the WdW equation.

## 1. On the uplift of 4D wormholes in Braneworld models and their 5D   structure

**Authors:** Thomas Pappas, Theodoros Nakas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19773v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we derive the general conditions that the metric functions of any braneworld spacetime must satisfy to describe a wormhole structure in the bulk. Particular emphasis is placed on clarifying the proper uplift of 4D wormholes, expressed in terms of various radial coordinates on the brane. We demonstrate the important role of the circumferential radius metric function for the embedding. The assumption of a warped extra dimension has non-trivial implications for the structure of 5D worm holes.

## 2. The Hole Argument for Reference Frames

**Authors:** Nicola Bamonti, Henrique Gomes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19760v1)

**Summary:**

We exploit the results of Bamonti and Gomes (2024) concerning the dynamical (un)coupling of reference frames to gravity. We introduce a new possible threat to determinism, which we call Arbitrariness Problem (ARB), resulting from the inherent freedom in selecting a reference frame. We analyse the role ofreference frames in the Hole Argument. We conclude that determinism is not the only way to explain the universe, but that it can be viewed in a different way.

## 3. Fully-relativistic evolution of vacuum tensor inhomogeneities during   inflation

**Authors:** Ericka Florio, E. Paul S. Shellard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19731v1)

**Summary:**

We present a complete method for the initialisation and extraction of first-order inflationary tensor perturbations for fully relativistic simulations. We outline a correspondence between the Cosmological Perturbation Theory (CPT) framework and the numerical relativity BSSN variables in the appropriate limit. The computational pipeline presented here will be used to study the emergence of a primordial tensor bispectra and cross-spectra that incorporate the effect of nonlinear gravitational couplings with the metric.

## 4. Quantum correlations in a gravitational collapse simulation with   SpheriCo.jl

**Authors:** Benjamin Berczi, Magdalena Eriksson, Thanasis Giannakopoulos, Paul M. Saffin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19722v1)

**Summary:**

SpheriCo.jl is a code that computes gravitational collapse of a spherical scalar field. The scalar can be either a classical field, or a quantum field operator. The code is also used to compute two-point correlation functions, with results that hint at a non-trivial correlation across the horizon of Hawking quanta. We are able to observe critical behavior of gravitational collapse for the classical setup, in agreement with expected results. We present a suite of tests for the code that tests its accuracy and stability.

## 5. Love Numbers for Extremal Kerr Black Hole

**Authors:** Malcolm Perry, Maria J. Rodriguez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19699v1)

**Summary:**

We perform a detailed study of the gravitational tidal Love numbers of extremal zero-temperature Kerr black holes. These coefficients are finite and exhibit the dissipative nature of these maximally spinning black hole. We provide explicit expressions of the Love numbers at low frequencies. Their calculation is simplified to specific formulas, which are directly derived using the Leaver-MST methods.

## 6. Combining Machine Learning with Recurrence Analysis for resonance   detection

**Authors:** Ondřej Zelenka, Ondřej Kopáček, Georgios Lukes-Gerakopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19683v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19683v1)

**Summary:**

The width of a resonance in a nearly integrable system can tell us how a perturbation parameter is driving the system away from integrability. In an EMRI a lighter compact object, like a black hole or a neutron star, inspirals into a supermassive black hole due to gravitational radiation reaction. During this inspiral the lighter object crosses resonances, which are still not very well modeled. Measuring the width of resonances in EMRI models allows us to estimate the importance of each perturbative parameter.

## 7. Multipole moments in stationary spacetimes

**Authors:** Jorn van Voorthuizen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19667v1)

**Summary:**

Multipole moments in general relativity serve as a powerful tool for characterising the gravitational field. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition. We formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. We discuss how the multipole moments behave under certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how they behave under such transformations.

## 8. Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$α$ and H$β$ active   galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic   and broad H$α$ luminosities

**Authors:** Shulei Cao, Amit Kumar Mandal, Michal Zajaček, Bożena Czerny, Bharat Ratra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665v1)

**Summary:**

We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmologists. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmologically probe.

## 9. Primordial Black Hole Formation from the Upward Step Model: Avoiding   Overproduction

**Authors:** Xiaoding Wang, Xiao-Han Ma, Yi-Fu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19631v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19631v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in an upward step inflationary model. We show that non-Gaussianity modifies both the curvature perturbation profile and the integration path in probability space. By accounting for non-perturbative effects, we resolve the overproduction of PBHs suggested by pulsar timing array (PTA) data, underscoring the critical importance of incorporating non- Gaussianity in future studies. We present an example where a positive $f_NL$ does not necessarily enhance PBH production, contrary to conventional expectations.

## 10. An Exact Black Hole Scattering Amplitude

**Authors:** Alfredo Guevara, Uri Kol, Huy Tran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19627v1)

**Summary:**

General Relativity famously predicts precession of orbital motions in the Schwarzschild metric. We show that by adding a NUT charge $N = iM$ the precession vanishes to all orders in $G$ even for rotating black holes. We conjecture a generalization of the eikonal formula and show that the classical integrable trajectories determine the full quantum amplitude for this black hole. Several consequences of integrability in self-dual gravity are discussed. We also conjecture that the quantum amplitude of a black hole can be determined by means of exponentiation of the Post-Minkowskian radial action.

## 11. An impediment to torsion from spectral geometry

**Authors:** Arkadiusz Bochniak, Ludwik Dąbrowski, Andrzej Sitarz, Paweł Zalecki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626v1)

**Summary:**

No convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the Torsion shall be excluded from the consideration of general relativity. We conclude that there are no convincing arguments to support the inclusion of theTorsion in a general relativity model.

## 12. Newman-Janis Algorithm from Taub-NUT Instantons

**Authors:** Joon-Hwi Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19611v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the Kerr metric represents a pair of self-dual gravitational dyons (Taub-NUT instantons) The Newman-Janis algorithm precisely originates from this fact. More generally, this program of understanding four-dimensional black holes as systems of chiral dyons extends to Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Taub -NUT solutions as well. We show that this program also extends to the Kerr-Kerr and Kerr Kerr NUT problems.

## 13. Nonminimally coupled Dark Matter in Clusters of Galaxies: a fully   comprehensive analysis

**Authors:** Saboura Zamani, Vincenzo Salzano, Dario Bettoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19569v1)

**Summary:**

A non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can affect the behavior of dark matter in galaxy clusters. We have considered the case of a disformal coupling, which leads to a modification of the Poisson equation. We aim to constrain the key parameter in our model, the characteristic coupling length. Our findings show that the coupling length is typically very small, thus being fully consistent with general relativity, although with an upper limit at $1\sigma$ which is of the order of $100$ kpc.

## 14. HBT interferometry and Quantum Detection of Primordial Gravitational   Waves in Hořava-Lifshitz Gravity

**Authors:** Sugumi Kanno, Hiroki Matsui, Shinji Mukohyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514v1)

**Summary:**

Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity is recognized as a renormalizable, unitary, and asymptotically free quantum field theory of gravity. One of its cosmological predictions is that it can produce scale-invariant primordial density fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves without relying on inflation. In this paper, we investigate the quantum nature of the prim Primordial gravitational waves generated in Ho\v {r}.ava Lif Shitz gravity.

## 15. Pulse-induced memory-like effect in cyclotron motion?

**Authors:** Sayan Kar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19460v1)

**Summary:**

A pulse-induced 'electromagnetic memory-like effect' is observed. The effect is not quite a wave memory, but has similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context. The magnitude of the velocity undergoes a change too, akin to a 'velocity kick' The results suggest a pulse- induced 'electron memory- like effect', which is notquite a 'wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similarfeatures within asimple, non -relativist context.

## 16. Significant circular Unruh effect at small acceleration

**Authors:** Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454v1)

**Summary:**

The circular version of the Unruh effect can be significant even at very small centripetal accelerations, say the researchers. This finding sheds new light on the experimental detection of the circular UnruH effect, they say. The study was published in the journal Physical Review Letters. The authors say the research was conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the lab of physicist  David Bennett. They say the study was conducted on atoms rotating in a circular orbit in vacuum.

## 17. Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems

**Authors:** Simon Lyakhovich, nikit Sinelnikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations restricting the trajectory. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from a requirement that this gauge variation ofThe action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not Lagrangian as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket.

## 18. Correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors for   massive fields in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime

**Authors:** Zainab Malik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19443v1)

**Summary:**

 correspondence is known to be exact in the eikonal regime for a large class of asymptotically flat black holes. We demonstrate that there exists a regime where the correspondence holds with unprecedented accuracy even for the lowest multipole numbers. We also fill the gap in the existing literature via finding the grey-body factors of a massive scalar field in the Schwarzschild- de Sitter background, when the field mass is not very small. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 19. Vector wormholes as conduits for matter interaction

**Authors:** Nailya Ganiyeva, Bruno J. Barros, Álvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz, Francisco S. N. Lobo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19408v1)

**Summary:**

In the framework of four-dimensional spacetimes, the theory of a massive one-form propagates three massive vector degrees of freedom. The inclusion of a self-interacting potential in this theory results in the breaking of gauge invariance. The breaking of such a fundamental symmetry in Classical Electromagnetism may introduce a ghost mode in massive vector theories, which generally leads to their instability. The existence of at least one ghost degree of freedom turns out to be a necessary condition to support these exotic geometries within effective field theories.
