## 0. On the uniqueness of the Kerr-(A)dS metric as a type II(D) solution in   six dimensions

**Authors:** David Kokoška, Marcello Ortaggio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10532v1)

**Summary:**

We study the class of six-dimensional spacetimes which admit a non-degenerate multiple Weyl aligned null direction l. The obtained family is locally isometric to the general doubly-spinning Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric with the NUTs parameters switched off. All solutions turn out to be Kerr--Schild sp acetimes of type~D and, in passing, we comment on their Kerr --Schild double copy. We further show that the obtained family of Kerr-Schildspacetimes is a unified metric form in all even dimensions.

## 1. Possibility of Multi-Messenger Observations of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions   with X-rays and Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Tomoya Suzuguchi, Hidetoshi Omiya, Hiroki Takeda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10488v1)

**Summary:**

Recent X-ray observations have discovered a class of periodic flares in galactic nuclei known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) A promising explanation of QPEs is an emission produced when a stellar-mass object orbiting a central supermassive black hole crosses an accretion disk. If the companion is a compact object, such systems would be a prospective multi-messenger target for the space-based observatory LISA and its successors. We predict at most one joint detection during LISA's nominal mission lifetime. Extending GW sensitivity into the sub-millihertz regime would raise the possibility of the joint detection by an order of magnitude.

## 2. Crystallizing spacetime: a fundamentally classical framework for quantum   gravity

**Authors:** Filip Strubbe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10383v1)

**Summary:**

Conventional approaches to quantum gravity regard quantum principles, such as nonlocality and superposition, as fundamental properties of nature. This work introduces a theory of crystallizing spacetime, which offers an alternative perspective. Since this framework is grounded in concepts analogous to realism, locality, and determinism at its foundations, it brings Einstein's long-sought intuitive worldview within reach. The resulting crystallizing Spacetime framework not only resolves the measurement problem but also provides a compelling basis for a unified theory of matter and gravity.

## 3. Space cannot stretch too {\it fast}

**Authors:** Samir D. Mathur

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10368v1)

**Summary:**

Black holes microstates leave an imprint on the gravitational vacuum through their virtual fluctuations. This imprint yields a power law fall off -- rather than an exponential fall off. This resolution of the information puzzle also implies an extra energy source at the scale of the cosmological horizon. It may explain the mysteries of dark energy and the Hubble tension. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time. It was published by Springer, a division of Springer Group, in association with the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 4. Confronting recent light compact star observations with color-flavor   locked quark matter

**Authors:** K. Kourmpetis, P. Laskos-Patkos, Ch. C. Moustakidis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10329v1)

**Summary:**

Recent analyses on the properties of the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant and the PSR J1231-1411 pulsar indicated that these two compact objects are characterized by similar (low) masses and possibly different radii. This paper aims at reconciling the aforementioned measurements by utilizing the widely employed color-flavor locked (CFL) MIT bag model. The main objective is related to the examination of the acceptable values for the color superconducting gap $Delta$ and the bag parameter $B$.

## 5. Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT   results

**Authors:** Andrea Addazi, Yermek Aldabergenov, Sergei V. Ketov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305v1)

**Summary:**

The pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation. We explore how the higher-order curvature terms modify the inflationary predictions. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinksy model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinski models offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationARY predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.

## 6. Density perturbations in nonminimally coupled gravity: symptoms of   Lagrangian density ambiguity

**Authors:** Miguel Barroso Varela, Orfeu Bertolami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10291v1)

**Summary:**

The evolution of density perturbations is analysed in a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and matter. We consider the broken degeneracy between the choices of matter Lagrangian for a perfect fluid, and determine the differences between their effects on the effective gravitational constant. We show how it can lead to unphysical singular behaviour for late-time dominating models. This divergent regime can be avoided when considering the fully non-quasistatic perturbative equations, although the higher-order nature of the nonminimally coupled theory strongly constrains these modifications.

## 7. Resolving Individual Signal in the Presence of Stochastic Background in   Future Pulsar Timing Arrays

**Authors:** Kazuya Furusawa, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Kiyotomo Ichiki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10284v1)

**Summary:**

Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) observations have reported evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) If supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are indeed the primary source of this signal, future PTA observations are expected to capture multiple continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) emitted by bright individual SMBH binaries. To address this anticipated scenario in the SKA era, we revisit the F-statistic, a detection method for single source signals in PTA datasets, and introduce a new modeling that accounts for unresolved GWs as a stochastic GWB.

## 8. Classification of Feynman integral geometries for black-hole scattering   at 5PM order

**Authors:** Daniel Brammer, Hjalte Frellesvig, Roger Morales, Matthias Wilhelm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10274v1)

**Summary:**

We provide a complete classification of the Feynman integral geometries relevant to the scattering of two black holes at fifth order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. The analysis includes integrals relevant to both the conservative and dissipative dynamics, as well as to all orders in the self-force (SF) expansion, i.e. the 0SF, 1SF and 2SF orders. We find that out of the 16,596 potentially contributing integral topologies, only 70 need to be analyzed in detail.

## 9. Potential Reconstruction from ACT Observations Leading to Polynomial   $α$-Attractor

**Authors:** Zhu Yi, Xingzhi Wang, Qing Gao, Yungui Gong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10268v1)

**Summary:**

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently reported updated measurements of the scalar spectral index $n_s$, which exhibit tension with predictions from many conventional inflationary models. In this work, we adopt a parameterization of the spectral index of the form $ n_s = 1 - p/(N + \alpha)$ and reconstruct an inflationary potential that is consistent with the latest ACT data. The reconstructed potential corresponds to the form of the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor potential.

## 10. Implications of pulsar timing arrays for Gauss-Bonnet Inflation

**Authors:** Reginald Christian Bernardo, Seoktae Koh, Gansukh Tumurtushaa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10235v1)

**Summary:**

Time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. We discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary model to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.

## 11. Spherical trapped surfaces in n-dimensional general relativity

**Authors:** Ayan Chatterjee, Suresh C. Jaryal, Akshay Kumar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10210v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we examine gravitational collapse of matter fields in $n$-dimensional general relativity. The matter energy-momentum tensor under consideration includes dust, perfect fluids with equations of state and matter admitting bulk and shear viscosity. We show that, as expected, the time development of marginally trapped tube is intricately related to the initial velocity and density profiles of the collapsing matter configuration. This study clarifies the role of initial data in the formation of spacetime singularity during gravitational collapse.

## 12. Constraining Dirty Black Holes and pseudo-complex General Relativity   with the Gravitational Waves Transient Catalog 3.0

**Authors:** Yehu I. Maimon, Alex B. Nielsen, Ofek Birnholtz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10199v1)

**Summary:**

Pseudo-complex general relativity (pcGR) theory and models of dirty black holes. pcGR framework extends Einstein's theory of general relativity by introducing additional parameters that diverge from standard predictions in the strong-field regime. We analyze gravitational wave signals from coalescing compact objects to obtain new bounds on these parameters. We confirm the exclusion of 1PN deviations sufficient to avoid a horizon, and for the first time rule out 1.5PN as well. We also discuss implications for current and future gravitational wave observations.

## 13. Shared Properties of Merger-driven Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts

**Authors:** Yacheng Kang, Jin-Ping Zhu, Yu-Han Yang, Ziming Wang, Eleonora Troja, Bing Zhang, Lijing Shao, Zhuo Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10165v1)

**Summary:**

Recent detections of two long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) have challenged the traditional classification of GRBs. These merger-driven LGRBs may represent a distinct GRB population. This work aims to explore the shared properties in terms of hardness, energy, and duration among currently observed merger- driven LGRB events. We propose that such shared properties are unlikely to arise from the low-redshift selection effect and they become particularly intriguing when compared to the relatively weak correlations or lack of correlation observed in traditional merger- Driven GRBs and collapse- Drives.

## 14. Gravitational Core of Double Field Theory: Lecture Notes

**Authors:** Jeong-Hyuck Park

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10163v1)

**Summary:**

Double Field Theory (DFT) has emerged as a comprehensive framework for gravity. It presents a testable and robust alternative to General Relativity (GR) Lecture notes aim to provide an accessible introduction to DFT. Key topics include doubled-yet-gauged coordinates, Riemannian versus non-Riemannians, curvatures, and the Einstein field equation for the closed string massless sector. The lecture notes are structured in a manner similar to traditional GR courses.

## 15. $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars

**Authors:** Zi-Yue Zheng, Ting-ting Sun, Huan Chen, Jin-Biao Wei, Xiao-Ping Zheng, H. -J. Schulze, G. F. Burgio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10133v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate nonradial $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars in full general relativity. We use equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model. The validity of the universal relations during the evolution to the formation of a cold neutron star is confirmed. We then model details of the thermal and trapping profiles in a PNS with the canonical mass. The corresponding $f $-mode frequencies and gravitational-wave strain amplitudes are presented.

## 16. Distorted black holes: nonextensivity in the gravitational wave emission

**Authors:** H. P. de Oliveira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10067v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the interaction between a non-rotating black hole and incoming gravitational waves. We show that an apparent horizon forms once sufficient mass accretes onto the black hole. We derive the evolution of the Bondi mass and compute its final value. We establish a nonextensive relation for the absorbed mass as a function of initial parameters, such as the amplitude of the gravitational wave data. We also quantify the fraction of the incident mass absorbed by the black Hole. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 17. Resonant DM scattering in the galactic center under the influence of   EMRI

**Authors:** Takafumi Kakehi, Hidetoshi Omiya, Takuya Takahashi, Takahiro Tanaka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10036v1)

**Summary:**

Dark matter (DM) search is one of the greatest challenges in physics. If DM consists of particles, it may form a spike around supermassive black holes (BH) prevalent in galaxy centers. This spike could be potentially observed by altering the orbits of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), one of LISA's main targets. As the EMRI orbit evolves via gravitational wave backreaction, each DM particle experiences a significant number of resonances. Although the effect of each individual resonance is small, their cumulative impact might significantly alter the DM particle's orbit.

## 18. Charged wormholes in (anti-)de Sitter spacetime

**Authors:** Hyeong-Chan Kim, Wonwoo Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09981v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09981v1)

**Summary:**

In de Sitter spacetime, two types of wormhole throats can exist. In the anti-de Sitter case, particles traverse the wormhole. We present a family of charged, traversable wormhole solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant. These solutions are shown to be of Petrov type D, and we examine radial geodesics of null and timelike particles. We analyze the flare-out condition, which imposes constraints on the equation of state parameters governing supporting matter.

## 19. Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework   for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables

**Authors:** Farrukh A. Chishtie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947v1)

**Summary:**

Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT) is a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes before perturbative expansion. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment.

## 20. Probing the Dynamics of Gaussian Dark Energy Equation of State Using   DESI BAO

**Authors:** Saddam Hussain, Simran Arora, Anzhong Wang, Ben Rose

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09913v1)

**Summary:**

We present an updated reconstruction of the various dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(a)$, employing the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the model parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. We provide a concise perspective on the dynamical evolution of all models and the interrelations among them.

## 21. New cosmological constraints on the evolution of dark matter energy   density

**Authors:** Yupeng Yang, Xinyi Dai, Yicheng Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09879v1)

**Summary:**

We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time. We focus on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $2.4\sigma$ Our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI. The findings are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 22. Measuring the Black Hole Interior from the Exterior

**Authors:** Wu-zhong Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09878v1)

**Summary:**

In this essay, we argue that an observer outside the horizon can reconstruct the geometry of a black hole's interior through external measurements. We propose that this phenomenon reveals a fundamental correlation between the degrees of freedom inside and outside the black hole at the level of classical spacetime. This procedure builds on recent studies of the holographic duality of timelike entanglement entropy and its connection to spacelike Entanglement Entanglements. We conclude that this procedure can be applied to black holes.
