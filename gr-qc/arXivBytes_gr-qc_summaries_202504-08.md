## 0. Dirac equation on the Newman-Unti-Tamburino spacetime

**Authors:** N. G. Krylova, V. M. Red'kov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05270v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the tetrad formalism to derive the general covariant Dirac equation in the Newman-Unti-Tamburino spacetime. The effects of NUT charge are described analytically in the particle-antiparticle production on the outer horizon. Also the scattering resonances with imaginary energies are found for the massless fermion. The particular case of extremal NUT black hole with a single horizon, when the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy vanishes identically, is considered.

## 1. Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a Schwarzschild   black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo

**Authors:** Mirzabek Alloqulov, Tursunali Xamidov, Sanjar Shaymatov, Bobomurat Ahmedov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05236v1)

**Summary:**

Study of orbits around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded within a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. Demonstrates how the DM halo modifies the gravitational dynamics of the black hole. Findings suggest that future gravitational wave observations could constrain the properties of DM halos surrounding BHs, providing new insights into the gravitational wave signatures arising from the interaction between BH gravity and DM, the authors say. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 2. Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole   surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions

**Authors:** Angel Rincon, Sharmanthie Fernando, Grigoris Panotopoulos, Leonardo Balart

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. We have used the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the massive scalar field are varied. The solutions have been summarized in tables and figures for clarity.

## 3. Non-Smooth Multi-objective Controller Synthesis for Test-Mass Actuation   in Gravitational-Wave Detectors

**Authors:** Sander K. Sijtsma, Pooya Saffarieh, Nathan A. Holland, Sil T. Spanjer, Wouter B. J. Hakvoort, Conor M. Mow-Lowry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05100v1)

**Summary:**

This paper proposes a non-smooth controller optimization method for gravitational wave applications. Typical performance requirements concerning these type of suspensions are defined in terms of both H2- and Hinf-type constraints. Besides the controller, the distribution of the actuation is integrated with the optimization to investigate the feasibility of simultaneous controller and actuator optimization. The results demonstrate that the proposed non-Smooth optimization method is able to find suitable solutions for the control and actuators distribution that satisfy all required performance and design constraints.

## 4. Topology of circular orbits of charged particles in black holes with   multiple horizons

**Authors:** Yong Song, Jia Li, Yiting Cen, Kai Diao, Xiaofeng Zhao, Shunping Shi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05061v1)

**Summary:**

The study of the topological properties of circular orbits is opening up new perspectives for exploring the spacetime structure around black holes. For a multi-horizon black hole, if a circular orbit can exist between two neighboring horizons, there will always be both a null circular orbit and a timelike circular orbit. Whether these orbits are stable or unstable depends on the potential function. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time (ASST) and is published by the Royal Society of London.

## 5. Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry

**Authors:** Erdal Catak, Mahmut Elbistan, Mustafa Mullahasanoglu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043v1)

**Summary:**

Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for P\"oschl-Teller and Scarf profiles. We obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. We study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which shows the broader applicability of our method.

## 6. The Lorentzian splitting theorem with weakened curvature condition

**Authors:** Gregory J. Galloway

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05028v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05028v1)

**Summary:**

In this note we present a version of the Lorentzian splitting theorem under an averaged Ricci curvature condition. In its proof, we use the properties of achronal limits developed in [18] and [19] Theorem is based on the fact that the average curvature of the curvature is averaged by the curvature of the Ricci curvature condition in [18], [19]. Theorem is proofed using the properties of achronals developed in  [18].

## 7. Review of analytic results on quasinormal modes of black holes

**Authors:** S. V. Bolokhov, Milena Skvortsova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05014v1)

**Summary:**

We present a concise review of known analytic results for quasinormal modes of black holes and related spacetimes. Our emphasis is on those regimes where the perturbation equations admit exact or perturbative solutions, providing insights complementary to numerical or semi-analytic approaches. Particular attention is given to the eikonal regime and its correspondence with null geodesics, as well as to beyond-eikonal approximations based on inverse multipole expansions in parametrized metrics. We review analytic solutions obtained in the near-extremal limit of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes, and in the regime of large field mass.

## 8. Quartet-metric gravity and scalar graviton dark holes: supplements

**Authors:** Yu. F. Pirogov, O. V. Zenin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05011v1)

**Summary:**

This note includes results of a study of stationary spherically symmetric ''dark holes'', objects merging central black holes and peripheral scalar graviton dark haloes. An exact solution to be considered as a basic one for the dark holes is presented. This solution may, in principle, be used for a qualitative description of the effect of asymptotically flat rotation curves in galaxies. To convert the basic solution into a more realistic one suitable for astrophysical applications, a family of modified solutions is considered. These solutions are studied numerically for representative set of free parameters.

## 9. SILVIA: Ultra-precision formation flying demonstration for space-based   interferometry

**Authors:** Takahiro Ito, Kiwamu Izumi, Isao Kawano, Ikkoh Funaki, Shuichi Sato, Tomotada Akutsu, Kentaro Komori, Mitsuru Musha, Yuta Michimura, Satoshi Satoh, Takuya Iwaki, Kentaro Yokota, Kenta Goto, Katsumi Furukawa, Taro Matsuo, Toshihiro Tsuzuki, Katsuhiko Yamada, Takahiro Sasaki, Taisei Nishishita, Yuki Matsumoto, Chikako Hirose, Wataru Torii, Satoshi Ikari, Koji Nagano, Masaki Ando, Seiji Kawamura, Hidehiro Kaneda, Shinsuke Takeuchi, Shinichiro Sakai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05001v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05001v1)

**Summary:**

SILVIA aims to achieve sub-micrometer precision in relative distance control by integrating spacecraft sensors, laser interferometry, low-thrust and low-noise micro-propulsion. A 100-meter-scale mission in a near-circular low Earth orbit has been identified as an ideal, cost-effective setting for demonstrating SILVIA. The mission concept and its key technologies are outlined, paving the way for the next generation of high-precision space-based observatories.

## 10. The universal crossover from thermodynamics and dynamics of   supercritical RN-AdS black hole

**Authors:** Zi-Qiang Zhao, Zhang-Yu Nie, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995v1)

**Summary:**

Supercritical black holes exist in the region where both temperature and pressure exceed the critical point. The conventional view states that black holes in this regime are indistinguishable between large and small phases. Recent research reveals that the supercritical regime exhibits universal gas-like and liquid-like phase separation, which shed light on the study on the region of RN-AdS black hole in the extended phase space. We calculate the thermodynamic potential and quasinormal modes (QNMs) and identify transition curves between two different states.

## 11. Null geodesics around a magnetized Kiselev black hole

**Authors:** Vitalie Lungu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04905v1)

**Summary:**

A new magnetically charged Kiselev black hole solution is used to study the null geodesics in this spacetime. We derive the equations of motion and analyze their properties, including the gravitational lensing effect. The deviations from the Ernst black hole provide insights into the potential observational consequences of dark energy in strong gravitational fields. The 3D and equatorial plane orbits are discussed, with particular attention given to the effect of quintessence. It is hoped that the findings will shed light on how dark energy works in the universe.

## 12. Stellar isotropic model in the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of   general relativity theory

**Authors:** G. G. L. Nashed, Amare Abebe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04890v1)

**Summary:**

The theory of symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR) has gained much interest in the cosmology and astrophysics community. Within this theory, we discuss the method of deriving a stellar isotropic model. We examine our model using different observed values of radii and masses of pulsars, showing that all of them fit in a consistent way. To test the stability of our model, we apply the adiabatic index and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.

## 13. Traversable wormholes with multiple unstable critical curves

**Authors:** A. Rueda, E. Contreras

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04854v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04854v1)

**Summary:**

Identifying differences in the optical spectrum of various observed compact objects can help classify them as black holes or black hole mimickers, such as traversable wormholes. The number and position of unstable critical curves, as well as the nature of the accretion disk around compact objects, play a fundamental role in their optical appearance. We propose a general rational redshift function that allows us to trace the number of critical points of the effective potential and determine their nature as maxima or minima. The ray tracing method is used to study the trajectories of massless particles, particularly their behavior near the unstable critical points.

## 14. Black hole destabilization via trapped quasi-normal modes

**Authors:** Hsu-Wen Chiang, Sebastian Garcia-Saenz, Aofei Sang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04779v1)

**Summary:**

In the presence of non-minimal gravitational couplings, matter field perturbations on a static black hole spacetime may develop unphysical poles in their linearized equations. Physical solutions confined in the domain between the event horizon and a pole satisfy a boundary value problem, although with boundary conditions which are different from standard quasi-normal modes. Focusing on a Schwarzschild black hole in Einstein-Proca theory, we find that trapped quasi- normal modes accurately capture the behavior of perturbation under time evolution.

## 15. Penrose's singularity theorem and the Kerr space-time

**Authors:** Jonathan Brook, Chris Stevens

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04674v1)

**Summary:**

In the case of the maximally extended space-time, the assumptions of Penrose's singularity theorem are not satisfied. Calculations are done in detail showcasing the validity of the theorem. Misconceptions regarding the characterization of physical singularities by incomplete null geodesics are discussed. The results are presented in a paper published in the Journal of Theoretical and Applied Physics (JTPAP) in 2010. The paper is based on JTPAP's 2010 paper on the singularity of Kerr space- time.
