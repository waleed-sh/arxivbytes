## 0. On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities

**Authors:** Koushiki, Pankaj S. Joshi, Sudip Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14695v1)

**Summary:**

Density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. These fluctuations would have given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high density matter blobs that developed due to fluctuations. We study such a collapse in the inflationary epoch which has been assumed earlier to form primordialblack holes. Examining the dynamics of such a collapsed universe, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form. This treatment is within the classical limits, dictated by Planck's constraints.

## 1. How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power   spectra?

**Authors:** Vadim Briaud, Alexandros Karam, Niko Koivunen, Eemeli Tomberg, Hardi Veermäe, Vincent Vennin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14681v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14681v1)

**Summary:**

We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak.

## 2. Dynamical features and shadows of quantum Schwarzschild black hole in   effective field theories of gravity

**Authors:** Zi-Liang Wang, Emmanuele Battista

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14516v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14516v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the properties of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry involving leading one-loop long-distance quantum effects. Our analysis reveals that geodesic trajectories of both massive and massless particles can assume completely different behaviors depending on the sign assumed by the quantum contributions. The positions of stable and unstable circular orbits are determined by an algebraic quartic equation, which we solve by developing a straightforward and analytic method. We examine black hole shadows and rings by means of two different emission profile models. The Hawking temperature and the entropy of the black hole are also derived.

## 3. Matter creation, adiabaticity and phantom behavior

**Authors:** Víctor H. Cárdenas, Samuel Lepe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14509v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14509v1)

**Summary:**

We present a novel cosmological framework that unifies matter creation dynamics with thermodynamic principles. We introduce a generalized second law of thermodynamics by considering the entropy associated with the cosmic horizon. Remarkably, this framework avoids the need for exotic physics while providing a consistent explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Our results open new pathways for understanding the interplay between horizon thermodynamics, particle creation, and cosmic evolution, offering fresh insights into the nature of dark energy and its potential thermodynamic origins.

## 4. Memory and supertranslations on plane wave spacetimes: an on-shell   perspective

**Authors:** Andrea Cristofoli, Sonja Klisch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14480v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter, we revisit the computation of the classical gravitational waveform for a particle moving in a plane wave background using on-shell amplitudes. We emphasize the relationship between gravitational memory and the boundary conditions of external scattering states, which were neglected in previous works. We then provide the first tree-level expression for the waveform that captures all memory effects. The waveform is presented in terms of Synge's world function, with explicit tail terms, and a smooth weak memory limit.

## 5. On the Stability of Non-Singular Solutions in Effective Theory from   Kaluza-Klein Unimodular Gravity

**Authors:** Júlio C. Fabris, Richard Kerner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14398v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14398v1)

**Summary:**

Unimodular theory incorporating the Kaluza-Klein construction in five dimensions leads, after reduction to four dimensions, to a new class of scalar-tensor theory. The vacuum cosmological solutions display a bouncing, non singular behavior. From the four dimensional point of view, the solutions are completely regular. However, the propagation of gravitational waves in this geometry displays the presence of instabilities which reflect some features of the original five dimensional structure. Comparison with a four dimensional quantum model with cosmologically constant, which has a similar background behavior, is discussed.

## 6. Primordial gravitational waves from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry   breaking

**Authors:** Mohsen Khodadi, Gaetano Lambiase, Leonardo Mastrototaro, Tanmay Kumar Poddar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14395v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14395v1)

**Summary:**

Spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry Breaking (SLSB) on Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The SLSB is induced by a time-like Bumblebee vector field which is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. For positive $l$ values, the amplitude of GW shows a mild suppression compared to the standard cosmological scenario ($ l = 0 $)

## 7. Some Geometric Aspects of Curved Spacetimes Equipped with Torsionful   Affinities and Einstein-Cartan's Theory in Two-Component Spinor Form

**Authors:** J. G. Cardoso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14364v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14364v1)

**Summary:**

The classical world structures borne by spacetimes endowed with torsionful affinities are reviewed. Subsequently, the definition and symmetry properties of a typical pair of Witten curvature spinors are exhibited. A full description of the correspondence principle that interrelates Einstein-Cartan's theory and general relativity is likewise presented. The study concludes with a comprehensive two- component spinor transcription of Einstein- Cartan's Theory. The results are published in the book, "Theory of General Relativity and Spacetimes"

## 8. The two-vertex model of loop quantum gravity: anisotropic reduced   sectors

**Authors:** Iñaki Garay, Luis J. Garay, Diego H. Gugliotta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14352v1)

**Summary:**

The so-called two-vertex model of loop quantum gravity has been analytically studied in the past within a U($N$) symmetry-reduced sector leading to a cosmological interpretation. We identify eight geometric parameters describing the polyhedral configurations and four twist angles characterizing the system's dynamics. The privileged-direction sector, the bi-twist sector, and the inhomogeneous bi-Twist sector introduce degrees of anisotropy or inhomogeneity.

## 9. Detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background with the   space-borne gravitational-wave detector network

**Authors:** Jun Cheng, En-Kun Li, Jianwei Mei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14292v1)

**Summary:**

The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is one of the main detection targets for future millihertz space-borne gravitational-wave observatories. For a single LISA-like detector, a null-channel method was developed to identify the SGWB by integrating data from the A and E channels with a noise-only T channel. By combining these detectors, it will be possible to build detector networks to search for SGWB via cross-correlation analysis. Assuming a three-month observation, the TianQin-LISA detector network could be able to confidently detect SGWB.

## 10. Herrera Complexity and Shadows of Spherically Symmetric Compact Objects

**Authors:** Subhasis Nalui, Subhra Bhattacharya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14282v1)

**Summary:**

 complexity factor is the inherent simple definition that identifies the evolution of matter tensors inside a given region of space-time. We explore how complexity of compact objects (a fundamentally theoretical classification) is connected to the photon ring (an astrophysical observable in the universe) and its stability. We consider zero complexity systems and discuss its significance with respect to (wrt) formation of photon rings and hence shadows. Advanced observational data analysis tools augments the hope for identification of exotic gravitational objects, like the so called "black hole mimickers"

## 11. Revisiting purely kinetic k-essence

**Authors:** Israel Quiros, Tame Gonzalez, Ulises Nucamendi, Roberto De Arcia, Francisco Antonio Horta Rangel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14177v1)

**Summary:**

Study of the dynamics in the phase space incorporating the stability conditions for theoretical consistency is lacking. Our results confirm in a very rigorous and clear way that these models can not explain in a unified way the dark matter and dark energy components of the cosmic fluid. These models are not adequate to explain the existing observational evidence, in particular the observed amount of cosmic structure. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Light and Space. It is published by the Royal Astronomical Society of England and Wales.
