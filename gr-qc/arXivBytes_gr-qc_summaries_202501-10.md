## 0. Angular bispectrum of matter number counts in cosmic structures

**Authors:** Thomas Montandon, Enea Di Dio, Cornelius Rampf, Julian Adamek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05422v1)

**Summary:**

The bispectrum of galaxy number counts is a key probe of large-scale structure (LSS) It offers insights into the initial conditions of the Universe, the nature of gravity, and cosmological parameters. In this work, we derive the theoretical angular bispectrums of number counts for the first time without relying on the Limber approximation. We have implemented these expressions in an open access code to evaluate the bispectum for two redshift bins, $z=2 \pm 0.25$ and $z =0.6 \pm0.05$

## 1. Harvesting primordial black holes from stochastic trees with   $\texttt{FOREST}$

**Authors:** Chiara Animali, Pierre Auclair, Baptiste Blachier, Vincent Vennin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05371v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a novel framework to implement stochastic inflation on Stochastic trees. We show how primordial black holes blossom at unbalanced nodes of the trees. In the "quantum-well" toy model, we find broad mass distributions, with mild power laws terminated by exponential tails. We finally compare our results with existing approximations in the literature, and discuss several prospects for further research in this area. The FOrtran Recursive Exploration of Stochastic Trees ($\texttt{FOREST}$) tool is used to demonstrate its performance.

## 2. Bifurcations in Bosonic Stars: chains and rings from spherical solutions

**Authors:** Chen Liang, Carlos A. R. Herdeiro, Eugen Radu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342v1)

**Summary:**

We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic stars. We discover that excited state spherical bosonic. stars b ifurcate into two types of axisymetric bosonics. We have constructed chains of scalar bosonicStars with 7 constituents and their corresponding ring-like scalar Bosonic stars for the first time. Our results provide an explanation for the bIfurcations in bosonic star from the perspective of perturbations.

## 3. Shedding Light on Naked Singularities

**Authors:** Franco Fiorini, Santiago Hernandez, Juan Manuel Paez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05306v1)

**Summary:**

Electromagnetic waves propagating in the background provided by a spacetime hosting a strong curvature, naked singularity, are fully studied. In some of them, the singularity operates as a perfect mirror reflecting the surrounding fields. Strikingly, other solutions exhibit a perfectly well behaved, bounded power flux as they propagate towards the singularities, suggesting thus the possibility of having electromagnetic energy transference through it. The analysis is performed not only in the realm of geometrical optics, but also in the physical one in which field amplitudes must necessarily be incorporated into the description.

## 4. Scalar Field Action under 4D Isotropic Cut-off and its Cosmological   Impact

**Authors:** A. Aynbund, V. V. Kiselev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05274v1)

**Summary:**

 Specific action for isotropic fluctuations of scalar field is derived under the condition of 4D cut-off. It is implemented into the estimates of dark energy scale consistent with current cosmological data. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Light, published by the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2010. It was the first of its kind and is based on data from the Large Hadron Collider, which has been around since the 1940s. It has been published in a book called Astrophysical Theories of Light.

## 5. Rigorous analytic solution to the gravitational-wave overlapping event   rates

**Authors:** Ziming Wang, Zexin Hu, Lijing Shao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05218v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05218v1)

**Summary:**

In the era of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, signal overlaps will become prevalent due to high detection rate and long signal duration. While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding on the statistical properties for the population of overlapping events. For the first time we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlaps. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.

## 6. Many body gravity and the bullet cluster

**Authors:** S. Ganesh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126v1)

**Summary:**

Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS) The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients. MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark Matter.

## 7. Resummations for Inflationary Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** R. P. Woodard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05077v1)

**Summary:**

The continual production of gravitons during inflation endows loop corrections with secular logarithms which grow nonperturbatively large during a prolonged period of inflation. The physics behind these effects is reviewed, along with a catalog of the examples which have so far been found. Resummation can be accomplished by combining a variant of Starobinsky's stochastic formalism with a variant. of the renormalization group. The issue of gauge independence is also addressed, as well as the physics behind it.

## 8. Gravitational waves from r-mode oscillations of stochastically accreting   neutron stars

**Authors:** Wenhao Dong, Andrew Melatos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04968v1)

**Summary:**

$r$-mode oscillations in rotating neutron stars are a source of continuous gravitational radiation. The gravitational wave strain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping timescale. An observational test is proposed, based on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave signal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability switches on and coexists with impact-excited $ r$-modes before or during a gravitational wave observation.
