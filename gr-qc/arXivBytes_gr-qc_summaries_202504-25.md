## 0. Thermal Product Formula for Shear Modes

**Authors:** Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, Nibedita Padhi, Aditya Sharma, Sourav Singha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17781v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in ArXiv[2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in AdS5. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.

## 1. Long-term stable nonlinear evolutions of ultracompact black-hole   mimickers

**Authors:** Gareth Arturo Marks, Seppe J. Staelens, Tamara Evstafyeva, Ulrich Sperhake

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17775v1)

**Summary:**

We study the stability of ultracompact boson stars admitting light rings. We combine a perturbative analysis with 3+1 numerical-relativity simulations with and without symmetry assumptions. We observe excellent agreement between all perturbatives and numerical results. This family of black-hole mimickers is separated into stable and unstable branches by extremal-mass configurations. This separation includes, in particular, thin-shell boson star with light rings located on the stable branch. We conclude to represent long-term stable black- hole mimickers.

## 2. Extended Scalar Particle Solutions in Black String Spacetimes with   Anisotropic Quintessence

**Authors:** M. L. Deglmann, B. V. Simão, C. C. Barros Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765v1)

**Summary:**

We present new solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar particle in a black string spacetime immersed in an anisotropic quintessence fluid surrounded by a cloud of strings. We investigate the cases when $\alpha_{Q} = 0,\,1/2, \,1$, encompassing both black hole and horizonless scenarios. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics of scalar particles in this complex spacetime and the potential impact of dark energy on quantum systems.

## 3. Geodesic causality in Kerr spacetimes with $|a|\geq M$

**Authors:** Giulio Sanzeni, Karim Mosani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17763v1)

**Summary:**

The analytic extension of the Kerr spacetimes into the negative radial region contains closed causal curves for any non-zero rotation parameter $a$ and mass parameter $M$. Despite this, we prove that the KerrSpacetimes do not admit any closed null geodesics when $|a|\geq M$. This result generalises recent findings by one of the authors, which showed the nonexistence of closed causal geodesICS in the case $ |a|<M$. Combining these results, we establish the absence of closed nullGeodesics in Kerr sp acetimes for anyNon-zero $a$.

**Authors:** Gabriel S. Rodrigues, Rudnei O. Ramos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17760v1)

**Summary:**

WI2easy is a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics. It enables efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. The tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials, including large-field, small-field and hybrid models. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. It offers a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.

## 5. Pure Chromo-Natural Inflation: Signatures of Particle Production from   Weak to Strong Backreaction

**Authors:** Ema Dimastrogiovanni, Matteo Fasiello, Alexandros Papageorgiou, Cristóbal Zenteno Gatica

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750v1)

**Summary:**

As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge sector. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from the CMB to laser interferometers. The gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future gravitational wave detectors.

## 6. Flux tube clustering from magnetic coupling of adjacent type-I and -II   superconductors in a neutron star: persistent gravitational radiation

**Authors:** K. H. Thong, A. Melatos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746v1)

**Summary:**

Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tube. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. The maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortice exceeds by $1/2.

## 7. Multi-messenger standard-siren cosmology for third-generation   gravitational-wave detectors: Considering observations of gamma-ray bursts   and kilonovae

**Authors:** Tao Han, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17741v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17741v1)

**Summary:**

In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $ 0.034\%$.

## 8. Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation

**Authors:** Baptiste Blachier, Christophe Ringeval

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17680v1)

**Summary:**

Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. We present a time-reversed approach to Stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. We solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations.

## 9. Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in   $α$-attractor models

**Authors:** Daniel del-Corral, Paolo Gondolo, K. Sravan Kumar, João Marto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602v1)

**Summary:**

After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. We investigate the production of SIGWs during the pre heating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors.

## 10. Enhancing gravitational-wave detection: a machine learning pipeline   combination approach with robust uncertainty quantification

**Authors:** Gregory Ashton, Ann-Kristin Malz, Nicolo Colombo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17587v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational-wave data from advanced-era interferometric detectors consists of background Gaussian noise, frequent transient artefacts, and rare astrophysical signals. Multiple search algorithms exist to detect the signals from compact binary coalescences, but their varying performance complicates interpretation. We present a machine learning-driven approach that combines results from individual pipelines and utilises conformal prediction to provide robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification. Using simulations, we demonstrate improved detection efficiency and apply our model to GWTC-3.

## 11. Atemporality from Conservation Laws of Physics in Lorentzian-Euclidean   Black Hole

**Authors:** Silvia De Bianchi, Salvatore Capozziello, Emmanuele Battista

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17570v1)

**Summary:**

Recent results have shown that singularities can be avoided from the general relativistic standpoint in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes. Time loses its physical meaning and becomes imaginary. This dynamical mechanism, dubbed ''atemporality'', prevents the emergence of black hole singularities and the violation of conservation laws. In this paper, the notion of atemporality together with a detailed discussion of its implications is presented from a philosophical perspective. The main result consists in showing that atemportality is naturally related to conservation Laws.

## 12. Relic gravitational waves from cosmological horizon radiation during de   Sitter period: as zero-order approximation of inflation

**Authors:** Chen-Hao Wu, Xiao Liang, Ya-Peng Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17533v1)

**Summary:**

Graviton signals can exist in the current universe in the form of gravitational waves. We believe that the detection of such signals would provide a compelling test of Hawking's radiation theory in a cosmological context. These signals occupy a frequency band below the ultrahigh-frequency regime and possess a detectable energy density, offering a promising target for future gravitational wave observatories. We predict an energy density parameter of $log_{10}(\Omega_{\rm GW} h^2) $ depending on the reheating temperature.

## 13. Prospective sensitivity of CTA on detection of evaporating primordial   black holes

**Authors:** Chen Yang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478v1)

**Summary:**

The Cherenkov Telescope Array has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. During a 5-year observational campaign, CTA could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) We propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts and propose a new type of telescope to detect PBHs in the universe’s early universe. We conclude with a proposal for a new kind of telescope that could be used to detect primordial black holes.

## 14. Lectures on measurement in quantum field theory

**Authors:** Christopher J. Fewster

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17437v1)

**Summary:**

Introducing measurement theory for QFT in possibly curved spacetimes. Topics include: a brief introduction to algebraic QFT, measurement schemes, state updates, multiple measurements and the resolution of Sorkin's "impossible measurement" problem. Examples using suitable theories based on Green hyperbolic operators are given. The interpretational significance of the framework is briefly considered. The basic style is to give details relating to QFT while taking for granted various facts from the theory of globallyhyperbolic spacetime.

## 15. Baryogenesis in Conformally Flat Spacetimes

**Authors:** Felix Finster, Marco van den Beld-Serrano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17434v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze a baryogenesis mechanism originating from the theory of causal fermion systems. An explicit formula is derived for the rate of baries in conformally flat spacetimes. It sets the ground for concrete, quantitative predictions for specific cosmological spacetime. Our analysis covers Friedmann-Lema,.tre-Robertson-Walker, Milne and Milne-like spacetIMEs. We conclude that the baries of these sp acetimes can be predicted using the regularizing vector field.

## 16. Effective field theory of coupled dark energy and dark matter

**Authors:** Katsuki Aoki, Jose Beltrán Jiménez, Masroor C. Pookkillath, Shinji Tsujikawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17293v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters.

## 17. Gaussian generally covariant hydrodynamics

**Authors:** G. M. Sampaio, G. Rabelo-Soares, G. Torrieri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17152v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17152v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation. We treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance. We argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number.
