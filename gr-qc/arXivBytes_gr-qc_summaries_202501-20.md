## 0. Sign Switching in Dark Sector Coupling Interactions as a Candidate for   Resolving Cosmological Tensions

**Authors:** Miguel A. Sabogal, Emanuelly Silva, Rafael C. Nunes, Suresh Kumar, Eleonora Di Valentino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10323v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10323v1)

**Summary:**

This paper expands a well-established Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) phenomenological scenario. The novel feature consists in a transition mechanism which reverses the direction of the energy-momentum transfer after the redshift. We evaluate this model using a comprehensive set of recent observational data, including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus. We find the new model to be weakly preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by BAO-DESI data.

## 1. Asymptotic safety meets tensor field theory: towards a new class of   gravity-matter systems

**Authors:** Astrid Eichhorn, Razvan Gurau, Zois Gyftopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10307v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum fluctuations of gravity generically screen the quartic couplings in (multi-)scalar models. For a tensor field theory in which the scalar field transforms under an internal $O(N)^3$ symmetry, this has the effect of replacing asymptotic freedom, recently discovered at large $N$ on a fixed flat background. The fixed point originates from the competition between the effects of the matter self-interactions which, contrary to the usual scalar models, are antiscreening.

## 2. Near-Boundary Asymptotics and Unique Continuation for the   AdS--Einstein--Maxwell System

**Authors:** Simon Guisset

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10298v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we extend the results of both Shao and Holzegel-Shao to the AdS-Einstein-Maxwell system. We study the asymptotics of the metric $g$ and the Maxwell field $F$ for the fully nonlinear coupled system. Furthermore, we characterise the holographic (boundary) data used in the second part of this work. We also prove the local unique continuation property for solutions of the coupled Einstein equations from the conformal boundary.

## 3. No evidence that the binary black hole mass distribution evolves with   redshift

**Authors:** Max Lalleman, Kevin Turbang, Thomas Callister, Nick van Remortel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10295v1)

**Summary:**

The mass distribution of merging binary black holes is generically predicted to evolve with redshift. Whether or not such an effect is observed in gravitational-wave data remains an open question. We find no evidence that either the Gaussian peak or power-law continuum components of the mass distribution change with red shift. In all cases, we conclude that a redshift-dependent mass spectrum remains possible, but that it is not required by current data. The data remain more agnostic about other forms of redshift dependence, such as evolution in the height of the $35\,M_\odot$ excess.

## 4. Modular global-fit pipeline for LISA data analysis

**Authors:** Senwen Deng, Stanislav Babak, Maude Le Jeune, Sylvain Marsat, Éric Plagnol, Andrea Sartirana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10277v1)

**Summary:**

The data acquired by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be dominated by the gravitational wave signals from several astrophysical populations. The analysis of these data is a new challenge and is the main focus of this paper. We present a method to address the LISA data analysis challenge. It is flexible and scalable for a number of sources and across several populations. Its performance is demonstrated on the simulated data LDC2a. The paper is published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 5. A data-driven approach for extracting tidal information from neutron   star binary mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope

**Authors:** Adrian Abac, Anna Puecher, Jonathan Gair, Tim Dietrich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10272v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational-wave models have been essential to this success since they are necessary to infer the properties of the compact binary system from the observational data. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, will allow for more observations of binary neutron star mergers with higher precision. Improved waveform models will then yield more accurate parameter estimation, the authors say. They propose a novel approach for constructing phenomenological waveform model informed by observational data, using mock data representing a one-year operation as a baseline.

## 6. Rotating spacetimes with a free scalar field in four and five dimensions

**Authors:** José Barrientos, Christos Charmousis, Adolfo Cisterna, Mokhtar Hassaine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10223v1)

**Summary:**

We construct explicit rotating solutions in Einstein's theory of relativity with a minimally coupled free scalar field. We find solutions in four or five spacetime dimensions. These spacetimes describe, in particular, the back-reaction of a free scaler field evolving in a Kerr spacetime. In the static limit, these five-dimensional geometries provide higher-dimensional extensions of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, we say. We offer a comprehensive analysis of several recently proposed four-dimensional static solutions with scalar multipolar hair.

## 7. Binary superfluids: low-energy properties and dissipative processes from   spontaneous emission of massive phonons

**Authors:** Silvia Trabucco, Luca Lepori, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Massimo Mannarelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10194v1)

**Summary:**

The system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. The emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustichorizons. We show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless NambU- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambi-Goldston boson.

## 8. Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in   Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter

**Authors:** Jia-xiang Liang, Peng Xu, Ming-hui Du, Zi-ren Luo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. We analyze the abundance and mass range of PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition. The mass range falls within the only allowed ``asteroid mass'' window from current joint observations, and their abundance constitutes approximately 20\% of the total mass and energy of the universe. These findings strongly suggest that PBH's produced by. the turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark. matter.

## 9. Leptogenesis in the presence of density perturbations

**Authors:** Kenta Hotokezaka, Ryusuke Jinno, Rin Takada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10148v1)

**Summary:**

This beyond-linear effect is caused by the exponential decoupling of heavy particles from the thermal bath in the presence of density perturbations. At moderately large values it cannot be captured by linear perturbation theory. We illustrate this effect with leptogenesis taking the decay and inverse decay of heavy neutrinos into account, and discuss its phenomenological implications. We found that perturbings always enhance the (spatially averaged) values of the final lepton asymmetry, and as a result, constraints on the mass of heavy Neutrinos are found to be relaxed.

## 10. A state sum for four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum geometry in terms of   edge vectors

**Authors:** Roukaya Dekhil, Matteo Laudonio, Daniele Oriti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115v1)

**Summary:**

We present the construction of a new state sum model for $4d$ Lorentzian quantum gravity. It is based on the description of quantum simplicial geometry in terms of edge vectors. We also show how the new model connects to the LorentZian Barrett-Crane spin foam model, formulated in terms. of quantized triangle bivectors. Back to Mail Online home.back to the page you came from.

## 11. Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to   thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections

**Authors:** Qing-Quan Zeng, Xi He, Zhao-Huan Yu, Jiaming Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate symmetry in a scalar field. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments. We present our results in a paper published in the journal The Astrophysics of Gravitational Wave Theory and Theory (ASW) Volume 2, pages 1-3.

## 12. Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar

**Authors:** Ok Song An, Jin U Kang, Yong Jin Kim, Ui Ri Mun, Un Gyong Ri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observed observations.

## 13. Infrared Behavior of Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature   Perturbations

**Authors:** Chang Han, Zu-Cheng Chen, Hongwei Yu, Puxun Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09939v1)

**Summary:**

Induced gravitational waves provide a powerful probe of primordial perturbations in the early universe through their distinctive spectral properties. We analyze the spectral energy density of gravitational waves induced by isocurvature. This characteristic behavior differs markedly from that of adiabatic-induced gravitational waves, establishing a robust observational discriminant between the two modes of perturbation. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysics of the Early Universe, published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 14. Quantum field theory on curved manifolds

**Authors:** Tomohiro Matsuda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09919v1)

**Summary:**

Given a manifold of a system with internal degrees of freedom, the curvature is defined for the manifold. If one defines the local vacuum in the tangent space of the manifold, one can define a local mapping in the vicinity of the contact point, which is nothing but the Bogoliubov transformation. The curvature of the electromagnetic field gives the Schwinger effect, and the curvatures of the base space introduces the local Unruh effect, which realizes Hawking radiation if applied on the Black hole horizon.

## 15. Discovery and Multi-Wavelength Analysis of a New Dissociative Galaxy   Merger: The Champagne Cluster

**Authors:** Faik Bouhrik, Rodrigo Stancioli, David Wittman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09901v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09901v1)

**Summary:**

The Champagne Cluster exhibits the classic X-ray morphology of a post-pericenter dissociative galaxy cluster merger. We conducted a Keck/DEIMOS survey and obtained redshifts for 103 member galaxies. The redshift analysis indicates a relative velocity of 411 $\pm$ 180 km/s between the two subclusters, which suggests that the merger is happening near the plane of the sky. We used cosmological simulations to find analogous systems to constrain the time since pericenter (74-250 Myr)

## 16. Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond   field

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi, Ali Övgün

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat. We perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge.

## 17. Holographic Bound of Casimir Effect in General Dimensions

**Authors:** Rong-Xin Miao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09886v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein gravity, DGP gravity, and Gauss-Bonnet gravity sets a universal lower bound of the strip Casimir effect in general dimensions. We verify the holographic bound by free theories and $O(N)$ models in the $\epsilon$ expansions. It implies holography sets a lower bound for general boundary shapes, not limited to the strip. Finally, we briefly comment on the impact of mass and various generalizations and applications of our results. The paper generalizes the discussions to higher dimensions.
