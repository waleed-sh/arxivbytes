## 0. Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of   vacuum decay

**Authors:** Alexander C. Jenkins, Hiranya V. Peiris, Andrew Pontzen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829v1)

**Summary:**

Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. These boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory.

## 1. Fractional attractors in light of the latest ACT observations

**Authors:** Christian Dioguardi, Antonio J. Iovino, Antonio Racioppi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02809v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02809v1)

**Summary:**

In light of the latest results from ACT observations we review a class of potentials labeled as fractional attractors, that can originate from Palatini gravity. We show in a model independent way that this class of possibles predicts both a spectral index $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ We also provide a numerical fit for the parameter space of this models in the case of a simple quadratic and quartic fractional potential.

## 2. Quantum maximally symmetric space-times

**Authors:** Pedro Meert, Andrea Giusti, Roberto Casadio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02786v1)

**Summary:**

We show that 4-dimensional maximally symmetric spacetimes can be obtained from a coherent state quantisation of gravity. A possible connection with the central charge in the AdS/CFT correspondence is also noted. We show that geometries that approach the Minkowski vacuum exponentially away from the radius of curvature. We also show that a 4- dimensional maximally symmetry-rich spacetime can be created from a 3-dimensional symmetric Spacetime. We conclude that the 4-D Spacetimes are the most symmetric 4-dimensions.

## 3. Interpreting gravitational fields of Topologically Massive Gravity using   geodesic deviation

**Authors:** Matus Papajcik, Jiri Podolsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02772v1)

**Summary:**

We study relative motion of nearby test particles in Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) in three spacetime dimensions. We show that, in a suitable reference frame, the influence of any gravitational field can be decomposed into transverse, longitudinal, and Newtonian components. The influence of the cosmological constant manifests itself as an isotropic effect. We also discuss the physical interpretation of spacetimes of specific algebraic types and influence of various matter fields, namely pure radiation, perfect fluid, and electromagnetic field.

## 4. Is the CMB revealing signs of pre-inflationary physics?

**Authors:** Suddhasattwa Brahma, Jaime Calderón-Figueroa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02746v1)

**Summary:**

We point out the possibility of reconciling fundamental particle-physics models of inflation with data by considering non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions for primordial density perturbations. Given the latest observational constraints coming from the joint analyses of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the Planck Satellite and other missions, we point out that it is possible to reconcile the two models at the same time. We will publish our findings in a forthcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 5. The early universe is $\textit{ACT}$-ing $\textit{warm}$

**Authors:** Arjun Berera, Suddhasattwa Brahma, Zizang Qiu, Rudnei O. Ramos, Gabriel S. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02655v1)

**Summary:**

Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. We argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. We show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms.

## 6. One-loop correction to primordial tensor modes during radiation era

**Authors:** Markus B. Fröb, Dražen Glavan, Paolo Meda, Ignacy Sawicki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02609v1)

**Summary:**

The ability to infer properties of primordial inflation relies on the conservation of the superhorizon perturbations between their exit during inflation, and their re-entry during radiation era. Any considerable departure from this property would require reinterpreting the data. We model the plasma by free photons in a thermal state and compute the one-loop correction to the power spectrum. This correction grows in time and is not suppressed by any small parameter. The result is not reliable because it invalidates perturbation theory, it signals potentially interesting effects that should be investigated further.

## 7. Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Scalar Field Dominated Universe

**Authors:** Ethan Milligan, Luis E. Padilla, David J. Mulryne, Juan Carlos Hidalgo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02600v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02600v1)

**Summary:**

We present a numerical code that solves the Misner-Sharp system for a spherically symmetric cosmological model containing both a scalar field and a perfect fluid. We analyse the threshold for PBH formation under quadratic and quartic potentials, evolving configurations from superhorizon scales. Our results confirm that a Quartic potential behavior is similar to the radiation-dominated universe, resulting in a PBH Formation threshold close to the well-established value in radiation backgrounds. Conversely, in the Quadratic case we observe a significant deviation from the expected dust-like behaviour, due to wave-like effects opposing the gravitational collapse.

## 8. Unified Equation for Massless Spin Particles and New Spin Coefficient   Definitions

**Authors:** Zhong-Heng Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02592v1)

**Summary:**

The field equations for massless particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2 in arbitrary black hole spacetimes can be described by a single unified equation. This is the first discovery that these spin coefficients are interconnected through a generating function. The work will inevitably prompt a re-examination of the shared characteristics among various types of particles in black holespacetimes. It lays a solid foundation for studying the behavior of massless spin particles in any black hole background.

## 9. $Λ$CDM from broken diffeomorphisms

**Authors:** Javier de Cruz Pérez, Antonio L. Maroto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02541v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02541v1)

**Summary:**

We present a simple field theory model with reduced invariance under diffeomorphisms. The energy-momentum tensor is identical to the sum of pressureless irrotational matter and a cosmological constant. The model action is built from a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term without any potential or Lagrange multiplier terms. The corresponding sound speed is exactly zero in any background geometry and the model is dynamically identical to $\Lambda$CDM. We obtain an equivalent local scalar- vector theory.

## 10. Detection of cosmological dipoles aligned with transverse peculiar   velocities

**Authors:** Yan-Chuan Cai, John A. Peacock, Anna de Graaff, Shadab Alam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02525v1)

**Summary:**

First observations of a novel dipole signature imprinted on the CMB by transverse velocities. We predict large-scale dipoles in all fields correlated with the potential, observable via effects of gravitational lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) The ISW dipole is distinct from the small-scale moving lens effect, which has a dipole of the opposite sign. We show that the observed signals are consistent with LCDM predictions, and set limits on modified gravity.

## 11. Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: solitonic boson stars

**Authors:** João Luís Rosa, Nicolas Aimar, Hanna Liis Tamm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02472v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02472v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we analyze the polarization observational properties of solitonic boson stars orbited by spherical hot-spots emitting synchrotron radiation from a thermal distribution of electrons. We consider three boson star configurations with different compacticities ranging from a dilute model with a large radius to an ultra-compact model capable of holding null bound orbits. We observe that the polarimetric imprints of the primary images for all models are comparable to those of the Schwarzschild spacetime, and thus any potentially distinguishable differences must arise from the additional structure of secondary and plunge-through images.

## 12. Gravitational Wave with Domain Wall Dominance

**Authors:** Sungwoo Hong, Sung Mook Lee, Qiuyue Liang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02462v1)

**Summary:**

 Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken. Long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources.

## 13. A Spectral Approach for Quasinormal Frequencies of Noncommutative   Geometry-inspired Wormholes

**Authors:** Davide Batic, Denys Dutykh, Joudy Jamal Beek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02370v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02370v1)

**Summary:**

We present a detailed investigation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) for noncommutative geometry-inspired wormholes. By employing the spectral method, the perturbation equations are reformulated into an eigenvalue problem over a compact domain. Our results reveal the absence of overdamped modes, with all detected QNMs exhibiting oscillatory behaviour. For large values of the rescaled mass parameter, the QN Ms transition smoothly to those of the classical Schwarzschild wormhole.

**Authors:** Hemani R. Acharya, D. M. Pandya, Bharat Parekh, V. O. Thomas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02311v1)

**Summary:**

This paper presents the class of solutions to the Einstein field equations for the uncharged static spherically symmetric compact object PSR J0952-0607. The stability of the generated model is examined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion. This anisotropic compact star model fulfills all the required stability criteria including the causality condition, adiabatic index, and Buchdahl condition.

## 15. On energy-momentum tensor for gravitational waves in $f(R)$ gravity

**Authors:** Petr V. Tretyakov, Alexander N. Petrov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02253v1)

**Summary:**

The classical Isaacson's procedure for describing back-reaction of the averaged energy-momentum for high frequency gravitational waves is generalized to $f(R)$ gravity case. From the beginning it is assumed that an initial background could be arbitrary one. By next steps it is restricted to de Sitter space that is a novelty for the study of a back- reaction in $f (R) gravity. Relations of parameters, which preserve the de Sitters picture, and which disturb it are given.

## 16. An exact five dimensional Weyl-Geometry Gauss-Bonnet Black Hole

**Authors:** Sebastian Bahamonde, Máximo Bañados

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02230v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02230v1)

**Summary:**

Euclidean sector defines a fully regular metric coupled to the Weyl vector field. The Euclidean action and entropy are computed, with the latter following the simple $A/4$ form plus a term linear in the horizon radius. We present a new exact black hole solution of a 5-dimensional Weyl-geometry Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity. It is based on the theory of gravitational waves, which has been used to explain the universe's curvature.

## 17. Fully non-linear gravitational wave simulations from past to future   null-infinity

**Authors:** Jörg Frauendiener, Chris Stevens, Sebenele Thwala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02188v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02188v1)

**Summary:**

We present the first numerical simulations of asymptotically flat space-times whose computational domain includes past and future null-infinity. As an application, we explore the scattering of a gravitational wave in a black hole space-time. The study is conducted in the fully non-linear regime using an initial boundary value problem formulation of Friedrich's generalised conformal field equations. We calculate the Bondi energy, Bondi news and gravitational information at both past andFuture null-Infinity and discuss their relationships.
