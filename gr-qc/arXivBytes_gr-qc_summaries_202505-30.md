## 0. Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories

**Authors:** Mark P. Hertzberg, Oleksandr S. Stashko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712v1)

**Summary:**

We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.

## 1. Boundary terms in cosmology

**Authors:** Ángel Cuevas, Javier Chagoya, C. Ortiz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679v1)

**Summary:**

In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. We predict a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter. It can be related to a scalar field known as kination.

## 2. Measurements $\mathit{with}$ probabilities in the final state proposal

**Authors:** Ahmed Almheiri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23664v1)

**Summary:**

Bousso and Stanford (BS) argued that the black hole final state proposal leads to acausal effects and ill-defined probabilities for the AMPS experiment. We identify a loophole in their analysis using insights from entanglement wedge reconstruction and replica wormholes. We trace the cause of the BS problems to the misidentification of the physical interior where the second AMPS measurement happens from among the multiple interiors introduced by the first measurement.

## 3. The Multiverse: a Philosophical Introduction

**Authors:** Jeremy Butterfield

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23639v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23639v1)

**Summary:**

This book is a philosopher's introduction to the idea that our universe is just one of many universes. I present and assess three versions of the idea: one version from philosophy, and two from physics. In short, they are: all the logically possible worlds; all the branches of the quantum state, in an Everettian interpretation of quantum theory; and all the bubbles of inflationary cosmology. For each proposal, I choose one main philosophical question to discuss in depth. They are, respectively: what is a possible world; what is chance; and what is explanation.

## 4. Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R,   T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Uttaran Ghosh, Sarbari Guha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we examine the structure scalars formed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor of the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in $f(R,T)$ gravity. The dependence of various physical parameters, such as heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar and effective homogeneous energy density, has been clearly indicated. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure Scalars and the total mass-energy content.

## 5. Constraining primordial curvature perturbations with present and future   GW detectors

**Authors:** Mauro Pieroni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23521v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23521v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$) can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbation, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. An enhanced primordial power spectrum can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB) We briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets.

## 6. Causality Constraints on Black Hole Thermodynamics in Nonlinear   Electrodynamics

**Authors:** Yoshihiko Abe, Maxime Médevielle, Toshifumi Noumi, Kaho Yoshimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23483v1)

**Summary:**

In nonlinear electrodynamics, the Lagrangian is taken to be an arbitrary function of the electromagnetic field strength tensor. By requiring the absence of superluminal propagation, we show that the mass-to-charge ratio of extremal black holes exhibits a certain monotonicity. Under the same condition, we demonstrate that the entropy- to-mass-squared ratio of black holes decreases monotonically with increasing mass, while keeping the mass to charge ratio fixed.

## 7. Thermodynamics of four-dimensional regular black holes with an infinite   tower of regularized curvature corrections

**Authors:** Adolfo Cisterna, Mokhtar Hassaine, Ulises Hernandez-Vera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23467v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermodynamics of a class of four-dimensional black hole solutions. Despite their differing geometries, both branches share the same free energy at fixed temperature. We identify two distinct branches: a regular black hole supported by a nontrivial scalar field and a non-regular general relativity solution with a trivial scalar profile. The regular solution may be thermodynamically favored (or not) over the Schwarzschild-AdS solution depending on the values of the coupling constants of the theory.

## 8. On the spectra of holographic QFTs on constant curvature manifolds

**Authors:** Ahmad Ghodsi, Elias Kiritsis, Parisa Mashayekhi, Francesco Nitti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23366v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze linear fluctuations of five-dimensional Einstein-Dilaton theories dual to holographic quantum field theories. We identify the physical propagating scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. We numerically compute the spectra in a concrete model characterized by a polynomial dilaton bulk potential admitting holographic RG-flow solutions with a UV and IR fixed points. In this case, we find no discrete spectrum and no perturbative instabilities. In the dual QFT, the eigenstates correspond to towers of spin-0 and spin-2 particles propagating on $(A)dS_4$

## 9. Black hole/de Sitter as the fastest transmitter/receiver

**Authors:** Rong-Gen Cai, Li Hu, Shao-Jiang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23314v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum speed limit on how fast a quantum system can evolve unitarily, when saturating the maximal information transmission bounds (Pendry's bound and Bremermann-Bekenstein bound), will slow down the would-be divergent rate of dynamical black hole entropy decreasing at the very end of the Hawking evaporation. Therefore, an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole is the fastest transmitter of information in nature. The would- be-ended inflating de Sitter space is theFastest Receiver of Information in Nature.

## 10. Quantum circuit simulation of black hole evaporation and Maxwell demon   interpretation

**Authors:** H. Hadi, Amin Rezaei Akbarieh, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23226v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23226v1)

**Summary:**

We suggest a quantum circuit model which simulates the black-hole evaporation process. The model assumes a Maxwell's demon operating within a black hole interior. It mimics the behavior of the entanglement structure of the near-horizon region and the early Hawking radiation located far from the black hole. We indicate how the demon, by applying nonlocal correlations, can mediate via Einstein-Rosen bridges for the purpose of simulating the transfer of quantum information across the horizon.

## 11. Shadows of naked singularity in Brans-Dicke gravity

**Authors:** Prajwal Hassan Puttasiddappa, Davi C Rodrigues, David F Mota

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23204v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23204v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit a class of BD solutions that exhibit a naked singularity. These solutions, despite lacking a conventional event horizon, exhibit photon spheres and produce shadow-like features. We identify the parameter space $-3/2 < \omega < 0$ as physically viable, ensuring attractive gravity and the absence of ghost fields. These findings suggest that BD naked singularities are possible candidates for compact astrophysical objects. We analyze null geodesics and perform ray-tracing simulations under a simplified, optically thin accretion disk model.

## 12. Taub-NUT-like Black Holes in Einstein-Bumblebee Gravity

**Authors:** Yu-Qi Chen, Hai-Shan Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23104v1)

**Summary:**

We consider Einstein-Bumblebee gravity and construct a novel Taub-NUT-like black hole solution within this theory. We derive all the thermodynamic quantities, including treating the cosmological constant as a pressure, and confirm that the first law and Smarr relation hold as well. We then take a further step by adding a cosmologically constant to the Einstein- Bumblebee theory, and successfully construct a Taub/NUT/AdS black hole. We conclude that the theory is not Ricci-flat.

## 13. Can we live in a baby universe formed by a delayed first-order phase   transition?

**Authors:** Qing-Hong Cao, Masanori Tanaka, Jun-Chen Wang, Ke-Pan Xie, Jing-Jun Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23007v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the idea that our universe began as a baby universe and show that this is feasible in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model with the classically conformal principle. The framework is consistent with current cosmological data and predicts a heavy neutral gauge boson, which could be detected at colliders. We show that the framework is compatible with the current data on the origin of the universe and that it could be used to build a new universe.

## 14. Bounds on the minimum orbital periods of non-singular Hayward and   Bardeen black holes

**Authors:** Guohua Liu, Yan Peng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23000v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the minimum orbital periods of objects around Hayward and Bardeen black holes without central singularities. Our results imply that such bounds may be connected to the presence of the black hole horizon rather than the singularity. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that both Hayward & Bardeen Black Holes conform to these bounds. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.
