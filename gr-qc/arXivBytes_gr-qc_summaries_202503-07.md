## 0. Superradiance of Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin Solitons

**Authors:** GuoDong Zhang, ChengHao Li, QiXin Xie, ShuangYong Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04657v1)

**Summary:**

Rotation in internal space can induce superradiance. We explore this effect in non-topological solitons of the two-field Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the scalars. We derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 1. Euclideanization without Complexification of the Spacetime

**Authors:** Nicole Drew, Venkatraman Gopalan, Martin Bojowald

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04654v1)

**Summary:**

Minkowski spacetime can be mapped by a series of projections in a higher-dimensional spacetime to a Euclidean space. The result allows regularizations and computations of integrals that appear in quantum field theory (QFT) without performing the standard Wick rotation of time to imaginary values. The procedure is also amenable to fields on curved background spacetimes as well as gravitational interactions. In all cases, complex-valued amplitudes of the form $iS/\hbar$ are mapped to real statistical weights.

## 2. A New Proof of the QNEC

**Authors:** Stefan Hollands, Roberto Longo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04651v1)

**Summary:**

We give a simplified proof of the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) Our proof is based on an explicit formula for the shape derivative of the relative entropy, with respect to an entangling cut. It allows bypassing the analytic continuation arguments of a previous proof by Ceyhan and Faulkner. It can be used e.g., for defining entropy current fluctuations. For more information on the QNEC, visit the Quantum Null Energy Condition Wikipedia page and the Quantum Entanglement Wikipedia page.

## 3. Searching for Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons with Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Silvia Gasparotto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04624v1)

**Summary:**

Ultralight Dark Matter (ULDM) offers an alternative to cold dark matter, characterized by wavelike behavior on galactic scales. This contribution summarizes our work on how solitonic cores induced by ULDM affect gravitational waves (GWs), enabling their detection through next-generation observatories like LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We show that continuous GWs from spinning neutron stars near the Galactic Center (GC) can probe solitons for \(m \lesssim 10^{-22}\, \mathrm{eV}\)

## 4. Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum

**Authors:** Zhiyu Lu, Théo Simon, Pierre Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a) We find a preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies.

## 5. Phase space structure of symmetric teleparallel theory of gravity

**Authors:** Dalia Saha, Abhik Kumar Sanyal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04551v1)

**Summary:**

Generalized Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity (GSTG) does not admit diffeomorphic invariance. We show that in a minisuperspace model, which is devoid of the shift vector, the problem is alleviated for locally Lorentz invariant GSTG theory. However, the eerie structure of the Hamiltonian constructed even in the background of spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous Robertson-Walker space-time, can not be maneuvered. We therefore construct the phase-space structure with three different spatiallyflat connections for the `Lorentz invariant' linear-scalar- vector-tensor GSTG action. Diffeomorphic impeccable is

## 6. Mapping inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms of binary black holes from   black hole perturbation waveforms by machine learning

**Authors:** Xing-Yu Zhong, Wen-Biao Han, Ling Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04534v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04534v1)

**Summary:**

Numerical relativity (NR) simulations can provide the most accurate waveforms. It is challenging to compute waveform templates in high-dimensional parameter space using NR simulations due to high computational costs. We implement a novel waveform mapping method, which is an alternative approach to the existing analytical approximations, based on closed-form continuous-time neural networks. This machine-learning-based method greatly improves the efficiency of calculating waveform template for arbitrary source parameters, such as the binary mass ratio and the spins of component black holes.

## 7. Enhancing the sensitivity to ultralight bosonic dark matter using signal   correlations

**Authors:** Soichiro Morisaki, Jun'ya Kume, Takumi Fujimori, Yuta Michimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04484v1)

**Summary:**

In recent years, numerous experiments have been proposed and conducted to search for ultralight bosonic dark matter (ULBDM) Signals from ULBDM in such experiments are characterized by extremely narrow spectral widths. A near-optimal detection strategy is to divide the data based on the signal coherence time and sum the power across these segments. We demonstrate that coherent SNR achieves sensitivity independent of segment duration and surpasses the performance of the conventional incoherent-sum approach, through analytical arguments and numerical experiments.

## 8. Can we disentangle between the emission of an accretion disc around a   single black hole and a circumbinary disc ?

**Authors:** Peggy Varniere, Raphaël Mignon-Risse, Fabien Casse

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04455v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04455v1)

**Summary:**

The detection of gravitational waves from binary black holes (BBHs) started the hunt for their pre-merger electromagnetic emission. numerical simulations have been looking for the "smoking gun" signal. Here we study if any of the expected features of circumbinary discs, such as the periodic modulation from the orbiting "lump", could be used to identify pre-Merger BBHs. We found that many of the features from a circumbina disc can be reproduced by a SBH system with different masses, distances or inner disc positions.

## 9. Global hyperbolicity and manifold topology from the Lorentzian distance

**Authors:** A. Bykov, E. Minguzzi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04382v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we seek characterizations of global hyperbolicity in smooth Lorentzian manifolds that do not rely on the manifold topology and that are inspired by metric geometry. The role of a new property which we term `$d$-reflectivity' is also discussed. We establish a result of broader interest: the exponential map of a smooth spray is $C^{1,1}$ (smooth outside the zero section). Additionally, we derive a LorentZ-Finsler version of the Busemann-Mayer formula and demonstrate that the Finsler fundamental function can be reconstructed from the distance.

## 10. Effect of spin on the dynamics of multi-component trans-relativistic   accretion flows around Kerr black holes

**Authors:** Kalyanbrata Pal, Souvik Ghose, Shilpa Sarkar, Tapas K. Das

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04321v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04321v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the axially symmetric accretion of low angular momentum hydrodynamic matter onto a rotating black hole. The gravitational field under consideration is assumed to be described by a pseudo-Newtonian Kerr potential. We find that depending on the values of initial boundary conditions, accretion flow may exhibit multi-transonic behaviour. We investigate, in minute detail, how the spin angular momentum of the black hole, as well as the composition of the accreting matter influence the dynamics of accretion.

## 11. Tidal response of regular black holes

**Authors:** Chiara Coviello, Luis Lehner, Vania Vellucci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04287v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate the tidal deformability of regular black holes (RBHs) Employing different phenomenological models, we analyze their response to both test fields and gravitational perturbations. Numerical and analytical methods reveal that RBHs exhibit non-trivial tidal responses, influenced by their regularization parameters and exotic matter distributions. Our findings suggest that RB hs possess distinct, though subtle, tidal signatures, which may serve as observational probes of their internal structure in gravitational wave detections.

## 12. Spherical accretion in the Schwarzschild spacetime in the Newtonian   analogous construct

**Authors:** Shubhrangshu Ghosh, Souvik Ghose, Kalyanbrata Pal, Arunabha Bhadra, Tapas K. Das

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04275v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04275v1)

**Summary:**

Newtonian analogous potentials (NAPs) corresponding to general relativistic (GR) spacetimes accurately capture most of the features, including all classical tests of GR. The NAP formulated by Tejeda \& Rosswog (TR13) for Schwarzschild spacetime has been applied to the standard thin accretion disk around a black hole (BH) as well as in the context of streamlines of noninteracting particles accreting onto a Schwarzschild BH. The study suggests that a (modified) hydrodynamical formalism is needed to effectively implement such potentials.

## 13. Kernel dependence of the Gaussian Process reconstruction of late   Universe expansion history

**Authors:** Joseph P Johnson, H. K. Jassal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04273v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04273v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we discuss model-independent reconstruction of the expansion history of the late Universe. We use Gaussian Process Regression to reconstruct the evolution of various cosmological parameters such as H(z) and slow-roll parameter using observational data to train the GP model. We examine the effect of the choice of kernel functions on the reconstructions. We find that non-stationary kernels such as polynomial kernels might be a better choice for the reconstruction if the training data set is noisy.

## 14. Chern-Simons states of photons and gravitons

**Authors:** Z. Haba

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04220v1)

**Summary:**

We consider an alternative quantization of the electromagnetic field around the Chern-Simons state. The solution determines a stochastic process which is a random perturbation of the self-duality equation for the electromagnetic potential. The method can be applied to a quantification of non-Abelian gauge theories by means of a Stochastic self-Duality equation. A quantization  of massless spin 2 tensor fields (based on self- duality) and its extension to aQuantization of gravity are also discussed.

## 15. Significant challenges for astrophysical inference with next-generation   gravitational-wave observatories

**Authors:** A. Makai Baker, Paul D. Lasky, Eric Thrane, Jacob Golomb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04073v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04073v1)

**Summary:**

The next generation of gravitational-wave observatories will achieve unprecedented strain sensitivities with an expanded observing band. Current techniques will not be able to determine the astrophysical parameters of the loudest of next-gen BNS signals. We show that standard data compression techniques become impractical, and the full problem becomes computationally infeasible, when we include data below 16$Hz. We discuss potential paths towards solving this complex problem. We carry out reduced-order inference on a simulated BNS signal taking into account the Earth's rotation and observatories' free-spectral range.
