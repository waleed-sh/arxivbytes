## 0. Mukkamala-Pereñiguez master function for even-parity perturbations of   the Schwarzschild spacetime

**Authors:** Eric Poisson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12377v1)

**Summary:**

The Zerilli equation was previously understood to govern the odd-parity sector of the perturbation only. Mukkamala and Pere\~niguez recently discovered a new master function. This function satisfies the Regge-Wheeler equation. The main conclusion of this work is that the greater simplicity of the Reg ge Wheeler equation is offset by a greater complexity of obtaining the radiation fields and reconstructing the metric. It is hoped that this work will lead to a new understanding of the theory of relativity.

## 1. Boundary Curvature Scalars on Conformally Compact Manifolds

**Authors:** A. Rod Gover, Jarosław Kopiński, Andrew Waldron

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12346v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a sequence of conformally invariant scalar curvature quantities, defined along the conformal infinity of a conformally compact (CC) manifold. Residues of their poles yield obstructions to smooth solutions to the singular Yamabe problem. We give explicit formulae for the first five CC boundary curvature scalars required for the global study of four dimensional Yamabe metrics, as well as asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. In a given dimension, the critical CC boundary scalar characterizes the image of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.

## 2. Investigating Evolving Wormholes in $f(R,T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Dhritimalya Roy, Ayanendu Dutta, Bikram Ghosh, Subenoy Chakraborty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12237v1)

**Summary:**

The present work examines whether evolving wormhole solution is possible or not in $f(R,T)$ modified gravity theory. In the background of inhomogeneous FLRW type wormhole configuration the field equations are investigated for different choices of scale factors and shape functions. Energy conditions are examined graphically for a range of values of the parameters involved. Finally, the possibility of emergent scenario at early cosmic evolution has been examined. For the power law and exponential choice of the scale factor from cosmological context and decoupled power law in each variable, wormhole configurations have been examined for two viable choices of shape function.

## 3. Black holes surrounded by dark matter spike: spacetime metrics and   gravitational wave ringdown waveforms

**Authors:** Dong Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12213v1)

**Summary:**

The black holes at the centers of galaxies may be surrounded by dark matter spike. This could leave detectable imprints on the gravitational wave signals they emit. The impact of dark matter spikes on the quasinormal modes of the black holes can reach up to the order of $10^{-4}$. These results may provide some help in further exploring the impact ofdark matter spike on the black hole and their related gravitational wave phenomena, the authors say. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 4. The role of finite value of strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$ and baryon   number density $(n)$ on the stability and maximum mass of strange stars

**Authors:** Pradip Kumar Chattopadhyay, Debadri Bhattacharjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12038v1)

**Summary:**

Study describes impact of non-zero value of strange quark mass and number density of baryons on structure, stability and maximum mass of strange stars. We derive exact relativistic solution of the Einstein field equation using Tolman-IV metric potential and modified MIT bag model EoS. For massless strange quarks, maximum mass is 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ and corresponding radius is 10.96 Km. Beyond these values, the energy per baryon drops below $930.4~MeV.

## 5. Probing Dark Star Parameters Through $f$-Mode Gravitational Wave Signals

**Authors:** Mariachiara Celato, Christian J. Krüger, Kostas D. Kokkotas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12031v1)

**Summary:**

Theoretical models of self-interacting dark matter offer a promising solution to several unresolved issues within the collisionless cold dark matter framework. We analyze the equilibrium structure of non-rotating dark stars, examining their bulk properties and comparing them with baryonic neutron stars. We show that the frequency and damping rate of $f$-mode oscillations of dark compact stars can be expressed in terms of universal functions of stellar mass, radius and moment of inertia. Finally, we propose a scheme to infer accurate values of the physical parameters of dark Compact stars from their gravitational wave signal.

## 6. Classical dynamics of particles with non-abelian gauge charges

**Authors:** Jan W. van Holten

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12021v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12021v1)

**Summary:**

The classical dynamics of particles with (non-)abelian charges and spin moving on curved manifolds is established in the Poisson-Hamilton framework. Equations of motion are derived for the minimal quadratic Hamiltonian and some extensions involving spin-dependent interactions. It is shown that these equations of motion coincide with the consistency conditions for current and energy-momentum conservation. The classical equations cannot be derived from an action principle without extending the model. One way to overcome this problem is the introduction of anticommuting Grassmann co-ordinates.

## 7. Modified gravitational wave propagations in linearized gravity with   Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations and their gravitational wave   constraints

**Authors:** Qiang Wang, Jian-Ming Yan, Tao Zhu, Wen Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11956v1)

**Summary:**

Standard model extension (SME) is an effective field theory framework that can be used to study the possible violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance in the gravitational interaction. It is shown that the violations modify the conventional linear dispersion relation of gravitational waves, leading to anisotropy, birefringence, and dispersion effects. With these modified dispersion relations, we then calculate the dephasing effects in the waveforms of gravitational wave produced by the coalescence of compact binaries in the LIGO catalogs GWTC-3.

## 8. Trace-free Einstein gravity as two interacting constrained $BF$ theories

**Authors:** Merced Montesinos, Diego Gonzalez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948v1)

**Summary:**

A theory of gravity alternative to general relativity is trace-free Einstein gravity. It has the remarkable property that the cosmological constant emerges as an integration constant. The new actions have the advantage of not involving any nondynamical fields or unimodular condition, and their only gravitational sector istrace-freeinstein gravity. They describe the theory as two $BF$ theories supplemented with some constraints. The first action comprises two copies of the constrained $ BF$ theory for the Husain-Kucha model. The second action employs two copies. of the chiral Plebanski action for general relativity plus an additional constraint.

## 9. Trace-free Einstein gravity as a constrained bigravity theory

**Authors:** Merced Montesinos, Diego Gonzalez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11939v1)

**Summary:**

Trace-free Einstein gravity is a prominent alternative to general relativity. In the first version, the cosmological constant arises as an integration constant. We report two diffeomorphism-invariant actions in which the energy-momentum conservation emerges directly from the equations of motion. To achieve this, auxiliary fields but otherwise dynamical are introduced in the corresponding actions, which have the form a constrained bigravity theory. These results constitute a significant advance in our understanding of trace- free Einstein gravity.

## 10. A class of charged-Taub-NUT-scalar metrics via Harison and Ehlers   Transformations

**Authors:** Mahnaz Tavakoli Kachi, Behrouz Mirza, Fatemeh Sadeghi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11934v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11934v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a class of axially symmetric solutions to Einstein's equations incorporating a $theta$-dependent scalar field. We extend these solutions by introducing electric and magnetic charges via Harrison transformations. We investigate some of astrophysical aspects of the charged-Taub-NUT metrics, focusing on phenomena such as gravitational lensing and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) We conclude with a look at some of the implications of our findings for the theory of gravitational lensed universe.

## 11. Black holes in thermal bath live shorter: implications for primordial   black holes

**Authors:** Jitumani Kalita, Debaprasad Maity, Ayan Chatterjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11925v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11925v1)

**Summary:**

 Hawking radiation from a non-extremal black hole is known to be approximately Planckian. The thermal spectrum receives multiple corrections including greybody factors and kinematical restrictions on the infrared and ultraviolet frequencies. We show that another significant correction to the spectrum arises if the black Hole is assumed to live in a thermal bath and the emitted radiation gets thermalised at the bath temperature. This modification reshapes the thermal spectrum, and leads to appreciable deviation from standard results. We argue that this altered decay rate has significance for cosmology.

## 12. Hereditary Effects and New Optical Properties of Nonlinear Gravitational   Waves

**Authors:** Yu-Qiang Liu, Yu-Qi Dong, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11890v1)

**Summary:**

The amplitude of continuous plane waves has a hereditary effect that grows with distance. hereditary effects imply that nonlinear perturbations are nonlocally dependent on linear ones. This property leads to some special optical effects which allow non linear gravitational waves to contain more information. It is even possible to extract information on the distance and direction of the wave source as well as the polarization from the waveform of nonlinear gravitational waves. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Gravitational Waves.

## 13. Charged rotating black holes in scalar multipolar universes

**Authors:** Cristian Stelea, Marina-Aura Dariescu, Vitalie Lungu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11807v1)

**Summary:**

Cardoso and Nat\'ario [6] constructed an exact solution of Einstein-scalar field equations that describes a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe. This solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7]. In this work we show how to further generalize these solutions in presence of rotation and various charges. More specifically, we describe the general charged rotating black holes with NUT charge and present some of their properties..
