## 0. Sub-Horizon Amplification of Curvature Perturbations: A New Route to   Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Debottam Nandi, Rohan Roy, Simran Yadav, Arnab Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16059v1)

**Summary:**

The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) This process also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant approach used in the early universe. We demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow- roll parameter can indeed enhance the scalarpower spectrum through sub-horizon growth. Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs.

**Authors:** Gaurav Bhandari, S. D. Pathak, Vikash Kumar Ojha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16043v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the Relativistic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (RGUP) effects on scalar and fermionic fields using the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation. Modified equations of motion, Hamiltonians, and stress-energy tensors are derived in Minkowski spacetime. This framework, applicable to high-energy physics, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmology, integrates quantum gravity into relativistic field theories. We show that spin connections maintain gravitational consistency.

**Authors:** Zihan Zhou, Giovanni Maria Tomaselli, Irvin Martínez-Rodríguez, Jingping Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025v1)

**Summary:**

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction of a star's gravitational binding energy, we transition to the second stage, where wemodel the disrupted material as free particles.

## 3. Unveiling the electrodynamic nature of spacetime collisions

**Authors:** Siddharth Boyeneni, Jiaxi Wu, Elias R. Most

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15978v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the geometrical nature of spacetime. By recasting Einstein's equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of abinary black hole collision. The results are published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 4. Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity

**Authors:** Leron Borsten, Michael J. Duff, Dimitri Kanakaris, Hyungrok Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973v1)

**Summary:**

 Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. We show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-Muller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory. We propose a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearizedgravity and its dual.

## 5. Consistency between Bulk and Boundary Causalities in Asymptotically   Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes

**Authors:** Lei Fu, Keisuke Izumi, Daisuke Yoshida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15910v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the consistency between bulk and boundary causalities in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. We derive a general formula that provides sufficient conditions for time advance, where bulk propagation arrives earlier than any boundary propagation. We demonstrate that the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg theory exhibits time advance when one or a linear combination of the coupling constants is positive and below an upper bound determined by the AdS length scale.

## 6. Leveraging differentiable programming in the inverse problem of neutron   stars

**Authors:** Thibeau Wouters, Peter T. H. Pang, Hauke Koehn, Henrik Rose, Rahul Somasundaram, Ingo Tews, Tim Dietrich, Chris Van Den Broeck

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15893v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15893v1)

**Summary:**

Neutron stars (NSs) probe the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this inverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and EOS, while effectively tackling data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.

## 7. The accretion disk and neutrino pair annihilation process of   Barrow-modified Black Hole

**Authors:** Yuxuan Shi, Hongbo Cheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15892v1)

**Summary:**

This paper attempts to clarify the deep consequences of Barrow fractal black hole spacetime configurations caused by quantum gravity on neutrino pair annihilation and accretion disk dynamics. We numerically solve the radiation flux, effective temperature, and differential luminosity distribution under the modified metric based on the Novikov-Thorne relativistic thin accretion disks model. This work provides important theoretical insights into the influence of quantum spacetime geometry on high-energy astrophysical phenomena in extreme gravitational fields.

## 8. Eccentric or circular? A reanalysis of binary black hole gravitational   wave events for orbital eccentricity signatures

**Authors:** Maria de Lluc Planas, Antoni Ramos-Buades, Cecilio García-Quirós, Héctor Estellés, Sascha Husa, Maria Haney

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15833v1)

**Summary:**

LIGO and Virgo have detected gravitational waves for the first time. Authors say there is evidence for eccentricity in some of the events. They say the findings highlight the importance of considering eccentric waveform models in future observing runs as they can help mitigate potential biases in parameter estimation. This will be particularly relevant with the expected increase in the diversity of the binary black hole population with new detectors, they say. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Gravitational Waves.

## 9. Bounce Cosmologies in Generalized Coupling Theories

**Authors:** Antonio Troisi, Sante Carloni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15825v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15825v1)

**Summary:**

We describe an exact solution representing a bouncing cosmology in the Minimal Exponential Measure (MEMe) model. Such a solution, obtained by means of the linearization around small values of the characteristic energy scale q of the theory, has the peculiarity of representing a complete bounce model. It can be used to explore quantitative processes in non-singular cosmologies. For more information on the MEMe model, visit: http://www.meme.org/.

## 10. Fast Higher-Order Interpolation and Restriction in ExaHyPE Avoiding   Non-physical Reflections

**Authors:** Timothy Stokes, Tobias Weinzierl, Han Zhang, Baojiu Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15814v1)

**Summary:**

Wave equations help us to understand phenomena ranging from earthquakes to tsunamis. These phenomena materialise over very large scales. It would be computationally infeasible to track them over a regular mesh. Yet, since the phenomena are localised, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be used to construct meshes with a higher resolution close to the regions of interest. ExaHyPE is a software engine created to solve wave problems using AMR, and we use it as baseline to construct our numerical relativity application called ExaGRyPE.

## 11. Backreaction in $f(R,G)$ Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Farzad Milani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15709v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15709v1)

**Summary:**

We present a comprehensive analysis of gravitational wave dynamics in $f(R,G)$ modified gravity. By developing a scalar-tensor formulation with two auxiliary fields, we systematically investigate both the propagation and backreaction of high-frequency gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds. The resulting formalism suggests potentially observable signatures in the propagation (phase shifts, amplitude modulation) and stochastic background of gravitational waves. These effects could be probed by next-generation detectors, offering new constraints on the coupling parameters.

## 12. Monte Carlo simulation of GRB data to test Lorentz-invariance violation

**Authors:** Hanlin Song, Bo-Qiang Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15685v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15685v1)

**Summary:**

Lorentz-invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime serves as a critical probe for understanding quantum gravity phenomenology. Astrophysical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising avenue for testing LV-induced spectral lag phenomena. However, interpretations are complicated by degeneracies between LV effects and intrinsic emission delays. This study systematically investigates three competing time delay models: Model A (LV delay combined with a constant intrinsic delay), Model B (energy-dependent intrinsic delay without LV), and Model C.

## 13. Dynamics of late time universe in $f(Q)$ gravity

**Authors:** Bikash Chandra Roy, Aroonkumar Beesham, Bikash Chandra Paul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15680v1)

**Summary:**

We construct cosmological model in nonmetricity scalar functional gravitational Lagrangian $f(Q)$ which describes the dynamical evolution of the late accelerating universe. The energy conditions for a realistic scenario are examined and noted that the effective fluid violates the strong energy condition. We also analyzed the variation of the effective EoS parameter and found that the matter content in the universe favours quintessence type fluid in all the $f('Q')-gravity theories. The transition of the universe from a deceleration to an accelerating phase is investigated.

## 14. Effective loop cosmology is a mere symplectic modification of standard   cosmology

**Authors:** Abraham Espinoza-García

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15655v1)

**Summary:**

It is shown that several prescriptions for the effective continuum limit of the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker loop quantum cosmology can be understood as the exact classical limit of Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of certain dynamical systems. The required symplectic modifications are explicitly constructed. It is argued that this state of affairs makes the case for the associated Wheeler-deWitt framework to be considered as an alternate quantumcosmology paradigm. It also demonstrated that a similar situation holds for two highly relevant anisotropic models.

## 15. Quantum Corrections and Extremality: A Generalized Universal Relation

**Authors:** Ankit Anand

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15646v1)

**Summary:**

Logarithmic corrections to the entropy of extremal black holes have proven effective in precisely matching the microscopic degeneracies obtained from string-theoretic. A non-perturbative quantum correction manifests as an exponential term in the black hole entropy. In this work, we extend the universal relation proposed by Goon and Penco by deriving a generalized form where entropy is not just the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our analysis treats entropy as a general function of the horizon radius. With the help of that, we formulate the generalized universal relation.

## 16. On the Klein-Gordon bosonic fields in the Bonnor-Melvin spacetime with a   cosmological constant in rainbow gravity: Bonnor-Melvin Domain Walls

**Authors:** Omar Mustafa, Abdullah Guvendi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15644v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the effect of rainbow gravity on Klein-Gordon (KG) bosons in the background of the magnetized Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime with a cosmological constant. A quantum particle remains indefinitely confined within this range and cannot be found elsewhere. We show that the corresponding bosonic states can form magnetized, spinning vortices in monolayer materials, and these vortics can be driven by adjusting an out-of-plane aligned magnetic field.

## 17. Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe

**Authors:** Deng Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15635v1)

**Summary:**

Today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. We demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the "Big Stall" Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.

## 18. Warm multi natural inflation

**Authors:** Asuka Ito, Rudnei O. Ramos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15606v1)

**Summary:**

Multi natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET.
