## 0. The effects of the spin and quadrupole moment of SgrA* on the orbits of   S stars

**Authors:** K. Abd El Dayem, F. H. Vincent, G. Heissel, T. Paumard, G. Perrin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24789v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24789v1)

**Summary:**

Measuring the astrometric and spectroscopic data of stars orbiting the central black hole in our galaxy offers a promising way to measure relativistic effects. In principle, the "no-hair" theorem can be tested at the Galactic Center by monitoring the orbital precession of S-stars. Closer-in stars, more strongly affected by the black hole's rotation, may be required. GRAVITY+ could detect such stars that are currently too faint for GRAvITY.

## 1. What solves the Hubble tension in phenomenological dark energy models at   background level?

**Authors:** Manosh T. Manoharan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24743v1)

**Summary:**

Few phenomenological models tend to favour higher values of the Hubble parameter, often at the expense of invoking phantom transitions. These models achieve this without introducing additional parameters, akin to the simplicity of the concordance $Lambda$CDM model. Excluding BAO Ly$\alpha$-$H(z)$ data points at a redshift of $\sim 2.3$ results in a Hubble parameter that remains in significant tension with SH0ES measurements. In contrast, including these data points favours a higher $H_0$, as they suggest a relatively lower matter density within the framework of the assumed fiducial cosmology.

## 2. The Quintom theory of dark energy after DESI DR2

**Authors:** Yifu Cai, Xin Ren, Taotao Qiu, Mingzhe Li, Xinmin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24732v1)

**Summary:**

 Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $Lambda$CDM paradigm. Dark energy evolves across $w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. We present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintum fields with ordinary matter and the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.

## 3. Likelihoods for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Data Analysis

**Authors:** Gabriele Franciolini, Mauro Pieroni, Angelo Ricciardone, Joseph D. Romano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24695v1)

**Summary:**

We present a systematic study of likelihood functions used for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) searches. By dividing the data into many short segments, one customarily takes advantage of the Central Limit Theorem to justify a Gaussian crosscorrelation likelihood. We show that approximating the exact Whittle likelihood by various Gaussian alternatives can induce systematic biases in the estimation of the SGWB parameters. Our results provide practical guidance for segment choice, likelihood selection, and data-compression strategies to ensure robust SGWB inference.

## 4. Sphere amplitudes and observing the universe's size

**Authors:** Andreas Blommaert, Adam Levine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24633v1)

**Summary:**

Sine dilaton gravity is holographically related to DSSYK. This paves the way for using two copies of D SSYK as hologram for Big-Bang cosmologies. The sphere amplitude also gives a prediction for the universe's size. In the context of slow-roll inflation, the no-boundary state is non-normalizable, and predicts a small universe, in contradiction with experiments. We argue that an avatar of these issues exists in dS JT gravity. We then consider the observer's no- boundary state and show that this prefers neither small nor large universes.

## 5. Covariant diffusion and drift of the stochastic GW background with LISA

**Authors:** Giorgio Mentasti, Arad Nasiri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24620v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24620v1)

**Summary:**

This model introduces a stochastic correction to the massless geodesic equation while preserving Lorentz invariance. It is dominant at lower frequencies due to the larger spacetime support of long-wavelength modes. The effect is phenomenologically described by just two diffusion and drift parameters, whose values are already constrained by measurements of the CMB blackbody spectrum. detecting a GW background sourced by realistic models of first-order phase transitions or primordial black holes can constrain the parameters down to a value of $kappa_1$

## 6. Study of Curvature-Matter Coupling in Modified Gravity

**Authors:** Lakhan V. Jaybhaye

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24470v1)

**Summary:**

This thesis investigates the $f(R, L_m)$ gravity framework to address unresolved issues in modern cosmology. Over the past century, General Relativity (GR) has been a cornerstone of gravitational theory. However, recent cosmological observations, such as the accelerated expansion of the Universe, challenge its completeness and the standard $Lambda$CDM model. This has motivated the development of alternative approaches, including dynamical dark energy and modifications to gravity. The thesis is divided into seven chapters.

## 7. Quantum Search for Gravitational Wave of Massive Black Hole Binaries

**Authors:** Fangzhou Guo, Jibo He

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24459v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24459v1)

**Summary:**

Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. The computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. In this work, a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm is applied to the MBHB signals. It is demonstrated that the quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. However, it is also found that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm.

## 8. The analytical general solutions of power-law inflation

**Authors:** Yao Yu, Hong-Song Xie, Bai-Cian Ke, Han Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24234v1)

**Summary:**

Power-law inflation has stood as a classical model in inflationary cosmology since the early 1980s. It is prized for its exact analytical solutions and ability to naturally resolve the Big Bang theory's horizon and flatness problems through exponential expansion. However, its simplest form appears incompatible with modern precision observations, motivating increasingly complex alternatives. This finding revitalizes Power-Law inflation as a viable framework, offering new possibilities for cosmological model-building while preserving its original mathematical elegance. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 9. Critical slowing down of black hole phase transition and kinetic   crossover in supercritical regime

**Authors:** Ran Li, Kun Zhang, Jiayue Yang, Robert B. Mann, Jin Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24148v1)

**Summary:**

Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-Anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) black holes in the extended phase space exhibit critical behavior analogous to the liquid-gas system. However, the kinetics of these transitions near spinodal and critical points remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that both the autocorrelation time and the variance of trajectories increase significantly as the system approaches these special points, signaling critical slowing down. This behavior is driven by the flattening of the free energy landscape, as confirmed by the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker-Planck equation.
