## 0. Bounds for Lyapunov exponent of circular light orbits in black holes

**Authors:** Emanuel Gallo, Thomas Mädler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10328v1)

**Summary:**

A natural question is whether this bound is satisfied by unstable circular null geodesics in the vicinity of black holes. It is intriguing to ask whether there exists an alternative universal bound that is valid in such situations. We show that for any spherically symmetric, static black hole that satisfies Einstein's equations and the dominant energy condition, there exist other universal bounds relating the Lyapunov coefficient to a generalized notion of surface gravity. As applications, we show how these bounds also constrain the imaginary part of quasinormal modes in the eikonal regime.

## 1. Novel electrically charged wormhole, black hole and black bounce exact   solutions in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity

**Authors:** Gabriel I. Róis, José Tarciso S. S. Junior, Francisco S. N. Lobo, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10324v1)

**Summary:**

This paper presents exact solutions for electrically charged wormholes, black holes, and black bounces within the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) framework. HMPG combines features of the metric and Palatini formulations of modified gravity, offering a powerful approach to address challenges in General Relativity. Future work will benefit from extending these solutions to include scalar potentials, addressing both early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, and applying observational data such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave measurements.

## 2. Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis   algorithm

**Authors:** Jay Bhambure, Rajeev Singh, Derek Teaney

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. We extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.

## 3. Relativistic Viscous Hydrodynamics in the Density Frame: Numerical Tests   and Comparisons

**Authors:** Jay Bhambure, Aleksas Mazeliauskas, Jean-Francois Paquet, Rajeev Singh, Mayank Singh, Derek Teaney, Fabian Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10303v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10303v1)

**Summary:**

The Density Frame is a formulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics. It is first-order in time, requires no auxiliary fields, and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. We compare our results to QCD kinetic theory simulations and find excellent agreement within the regime of applicability of hydrodynamicics. The Density frame results remain well-behaved and robust near the boundary of applicable. We also compare our findings to the second-order-in-time hydrod dynamic theory developed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK)

## 4. Towards an exact approach to pulsar timing

**Authors:** Amodio Carleo, Delphine Perrodin, Andrea Possenti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10299v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10299v1)

**Summary:**

Pulsar timing technique is used in pulsar astronomy to infer a multitude of physical information and to constrain possible corrections to General Relativity. The propagation delay is usually computed using formulas based on a post-Newtonian approach, for both the light trajectory and the orbital motion. Evidence has recently emerged that this approximation may no longer be sufficient when the companion object is a supermassive black hole. We conclude that in the future, post- newtonian formulas should be replaced with a more accurate approach in these systems.

## 5. Charged Particle in Lie-Poisson Electrodynamics

**Authors:** B. S. Basilio, V. G. Kupriyanov, M. A. Kurkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10247v1)

**Summary:**

 Lie-Poisson electrodynamics describes the semi-classical limit of non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory. We focus on the mechanics of a charged point-like particle moving in a given gauge background. We illustrate our findings by exploring the exactly solvable Kepler problem in the context of the $\lambda$-Minkowski (or the angular) non-Commutativity, along with other examples. We provide a detailed formulation of the classical action and the corresponding equations of motion, which recover standard relativistic dynamics.

## 6. Space-time toy model for Hawking radiation

**Authors:** Ralf Schützhold, William G. Unruh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10202v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a simplified toy model for black-hole evaporation. We glue together two sections of flat space-time in different metric representations. The simple structure of this toy model allows us to construct exact analytic solutions for the two-point functions in the various vacuum states. This helps us to understand and disentangle the different ingredients for Hawking radiation better. We hope this article will help you understand Hawking radiation and its effects on the universe better. Back to the page you came from.

## 7. Path integral measure and cosmological constant

**Authors:** C. Branchina, V. Branchina, F. Contino, A. Pernace

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10194v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the one-loop effective action of quantum gravity using a spherical background. We also consider a free scalar field and a free Dirac field on a spherical gravitational background, and find that the same holds true even in the presence of matter. These results are found without resorting to any supersymmetric embedding of the theory, and shed new light on the cosmological constant problem. We show that, if the measure in the path integral is correctly taken into account, and the physical UV cutoff is properly introduced, we get only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to the UV cutoff.

## 8. Stability of cosmological singularity-free solutions in quadratic   gravity

**Authors:** M. Asorey, F. Ezquerro, M. Pardina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10111v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a large family of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions in quadratic gravity which are singularity-free at early and late times. This kind of smooth solutions only emerges beyond the unstable de Sitter branch. The complete analysis shows that a Big Bang can emerge when the parameters of the theory are slightly modified, revealing the unstable nature of this type of solutions. We have analyzed the stability of these singulary-free solutions by computing the second-order variation of the action.

## 9. Microcanonical Phase Space and Entropy in Curved Spacetime

**Authors:** Avinandan Mondal, Dawood Kothawala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10058v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10058v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the structure of microcanonical ensembles in inertial and non-inertial frames attached to a confined system of positive energy particles in curved spacetime. The leading curvature corrections are characterized by Ricci and Einstein tensors, and their contribution is proportional to the boundary area of the system. We give a general argument to highlight two distinct sources of divergences in the phase space volume, coming from redshift and spatial geometry. We extend these results to $N$ particle systems in the massless (ultra-relativistic) limit for certain restricted class of spacetimes.

## 10. A Relativistic Tensorial Model for Fractional Interaction between Dark   Matter and Gravity

**Authors:** Francesco Benetti, Andrea Lapi, Samuele Silveravalle, Stefano Liberati, Balakrishna S. Haridasu, Yacer Boumechta, Minahil Adil Butt, Carlo Baccigalupi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10030v1)

**Summary:**

In a series of recent papers it was shown that several aspects of Dark Matter (DM) phenomenology can be explained by assuming the DM component in virialized halos to feel a non-local fractional interaction mediated by gravity. In a recent work we have looked for a general relativistic extension, proposing a theory, dubbed Relativistic Scalar Fractional Gravity or RSFG. We then take the weak field limit of the latter, showing that they reduce to general relativity sourced by an effective stress energy tensor.

## 11. Exploring the anisotropic gravitational wave background from all-sky   mock gravitational wave event catalogues

**Authors:** Zhencheng Li, Zhen Jiang, Yun Liu, Xi-Long Fan, Liang Gao, Yun Chen, Tengpeng Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09956v1)

**Summary:**

Anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) serves as a potential probe of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. We explore the anisotropic SGWB from local merging stellar mass compact binaries. The analysis employs seven all-sky mock lightcone gravitational wave event catalogues, which are derived from the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a binary population synthesis model. The spectra of seven catalogues exhibit considerable variations, arising from fluctuations in spatial distribution of nearby sources.

## 12. An Exactly Soluble Group Field Theory

**Authors:** Luca Marchetti, Hassan Mehmood, Viqar Husain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09851v1)

**Summary:**

We present a Group Field Theory (GFT) quantization of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} (HK) model formulated as a non-interacting GFT. We demonstrate that the path-integral formulation of this HK-GFT provides a completion of a corresponding spinfoam model developed earlier. We also show that the HK- GFT admits a unique Fock representation that describes the quantum three-geometries of the HK model. These results provide a link to the canonical quantization and demonstrate how GFTs can bridge distinct quantization schemes.

## 13. Multivariate Time Series Clustering for Environmental State   Characterization of Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors

**Authors:** Rutuja Gurav, Isaac Kelly, Pooyan Goodarzi, Anamaria Effler, Barry Barish, Evangelos Papalexakis, Jonathan Richardson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09832v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09832v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational-wave observatories like LIGO are large-scale, terrestrial instruments housed in infrastructure that spans a multi-kilometer geographic area. Despite exquisite seismic isolation, they remain susceptible to seismic noise and other terrestrial disturbances that can couple undesirable vibrations into the instrumental infrastructure. It is, therefore, critical to characterize the seismic state of these observatories to identify a set of temporal patterns that can inform the detector operators in day-to-day monitoring and diagnostics. It can be untenable for a human operator to monitor multiple data streams in this manual fashion and thus a distillation of these data-streams into a more human-friendly format is sought.

## 14. Hydrodynamic and Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities of Q-strings

**Authors:** Qian Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09815v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the linear response of Q-strings to perturbations along the cylindrical direction. The results show that the Q-string exhibits dynamical instability when the perturbation wavelength exceeds a threshold. Such results reveal the hydrodynamic properties of solitons. In the thin-wall limit, this instability degenerates into the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with a threshold related only to the radius of the cylinder. We show that this instability can be characterized by second-order hydrodynamics of viscous fluids.
