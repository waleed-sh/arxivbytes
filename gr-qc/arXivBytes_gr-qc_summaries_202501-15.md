## 0. Generalized entropy of gravitational fluctuations

**Authors:** Sean Colin-Ellerin, Guanda Lin, Geoff Penington

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08308v1)

**Summary:**

The correct treatment of quantum fluctuations of the metric is a longstanding problem. We provide a gauge-invariant prescription for the generalized entropy of gravitons in anti-de Sitter space in terms of areas and bulk entanglement entropy. We identify a class of perturbative graviton states that have parametrically larger generalized entropy than any low-energy excitations of an ordinary quantum field. The results exactly match vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropies for stress-tensor excited states.

## 1. Revisiting the shadow of Johannsen-Psaltis black holes

**Authors:** Xinyu Wang, Zhixing Zhao, Xiao-Xiong Zeng, Xin-Yang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08287v1)

**Summary:**

The Johannsen-Psaltis (JP) metric provides a robust framework for testing the no-hair theorem of astrophysical black holes. Verification of this theorem often involves analyzing the photon sphere near black holes, which is intrinsically linked to black hole shadows. Since the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the JP metric does not permit exact variable separation, an approximate analytical approach is employed to calculate the shadow. For JP black holes with closed event horizons, the analytical approach reliably reproduces results obtained through the numerical computation.

## 2. Quantum wormholes at the end of the world

**Authors:** João Magueijo, Ganga Singh Manchanda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08272v1)

**Summary:**

The two asymptotically flat Universes classically linked by the Einstein-Rosen bridge may also be quantum mechanically connected in their far out regions. This would be felt by the Newtonian potential far away from a black/white hole system, and raises the possibility of establishing communication via perturbations. We obtain our results by means of wavepackets with a small variance in the mass, solving the equations derived from a maximally symmetry-reduced canonical quantisation method.

## 3. GPU-accelerated LISA parameter estimation with full time domain response

**Authors:** Cecilio García-Quirós, Shubhanshu Tiwari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08261v1)

**Summary:**

We conduct the first full Bayesian inference analysis for LISA parameter estimation. We investigate the impact of including subdominant harmonics, compare equal and unequal arm configurations, and analyze different Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI) configurations. Our results demonstrate LISA capability to measure the two spin magnitudes and the primary spin tilt angle, alongside sky localization, with percent-level precision. We utilize full and uniform priors, with a lower frequency cutoff of 0.1mHz, and a signal duration of approximately two months.

## 4. Quantum-Corrected Hawking Radiation from Near-Extremal Kerr-Newman Black   Holes

**Authors:** Sabyasachi Maulik, Xin Meng, Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08252v1)

**Summary:**

Near-extremal black holes have a long AdS$_2$ throat in their near-horizon region. Quantum fluctuations in the throat region are effectively governed by a quantum version of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with matter and are strongly coupled at low temperatures. We investigate how these quantum fluctuations affect the spectrum of emission of particles during Hawking radiation. We find that for particles with non-vanishing angular momentum, the quantum-corrected emission can be substantially enhanced with respect to the standard semiclassical result.

## 5. Birefringence in fermion-attenuated gravitational wave power spectrum

**Authors:** Jinglong Liu, Stephon Alexander, Antonino Marciano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08240v1)

**Summary:**

Chern-Simons gravity is a theory that dynamically violates parity. We analyze the power spectrum of gravitational waves in light of the damping effect due to the free streaming relativistic neutrinos and dark fermions. We predict a falsifiable pattern of observable peaks and dips in the chiral independent gravitational power spectrum, eventually observable in next space-borne gravitational interferometers, including LISA, Taiji and Tianqin. Our result represents a useful tool to test Chern-SimONS gravity and enables to constrain mechanisms of inflation and reheating related to this theory.

## 6. Background subtraction method is as applicable as convariant counterterm   method, but much simpler

**Authors:** Wei Guo, Xiyao Guo, Xin Lan, Hongbao Zhang, Wei Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08214v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the background subtraction method is applicable not only to Einstein's gravity, but also to its higher derivative corrections for black holes in both asympotically flat and AdS spacetimes. As a bonus, we also obtain the corresponding expression of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the Euclidean on-shell action. This can be regarded as the first proof of such a relation, which has been assumed to be also valid beyond Einstein'sgravity without derivation before.

## 7. Cosmological model with Gong-Zong Parametrization in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity

**Authors:** Romanshu Garg, Tanmoy Chowdhury, G. P. Singh, Farook Rahaman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08161v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08161v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate the cosmic expansion scenario by using the Gong - Zhang parameter in the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity. Using Bayesian statistical methods, we obtain the median values of this model's model parameters for the cosmic chronometer and Joint (CC+Pantheon) data sets. We deliberate about the behaviour of key cosmological parameters, for instance, the deceleration parameter, and equation of state. We have examined the behavior of the Statefinder diagnostics and determine the universe's current age.

## 8. Role of injection parameters in jet propagation through realistic binary   neutron star merger environments

**Authors:** Andrea Pavan, Riccardo Ciolfi, Emma Dreas, Jay V. Kalinani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08032v1)

**Summary:**

First multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A. Effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution.

## 9. Geodesic deviation in the $q$-metric

**Authors:** Anuar Idrissov, Kuantay Boshkayev, Konstantinos F. Dialektopoulos, Ainur Urazalina, Daniya Utepova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08024v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the tidal forces between test particles falling along geodesics in the exterior spacetime generated by a static and axially symmetric compact matter source with non-vanishing mass quadrupole. It is shown that the presence of the deformation parameter affects the behavior of the geodesic deviation vectors, depending on its value. We observe that for arbitrary values of $q$ and $theta$ the behavior. of the deviation vector differs as it approaches the singularity at $r = 2m$.

## 10. Tidal Love Numbers of Neutron Stars in Horndeski Theories

**Authors:** Robin Fynn Diedrichs, Shinji Tsujikawa, Kent Yagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07998v1)

**Summary:**

In scalar-tensor theories, one typically finds new types of Love numbers that are usually not considered or simply absent in General Relativity. We present the linear perturbation equations necessary to calculate static and even-parity tidal Love numbers in Horndeski theories. We further focus on the quadrupolar Love numbers and demonstrate how these can be extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the perturbative fields. We find that the Love numbers can differ by $1/r^3$ if this additional contribution is not taken into account.

## 11. Inhomogeneous model with a space dependent Cosmological Constant

**Authors:** D. Comelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07968v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse an inhomogeneous cosmological model featuring a spherically symmetric bubble solution induced by a unified single perfect fluid. We impose an Hubble profile that matches the Planck value at early times. We explicitly derive perturbative solutions in two distinct regimes: one expanded around the center and the other expanded around a homogeneous FRW universe. In both cases, we compute the cosmographic parameters, redshift profiles for the Hubbles expansion rates and effective equations of state. Furthermore, we investigate the redshift drift behaviour extended to a Lema$\hat{\rm i}$tre metric.

## 12. Towards a realistic Buchdahl limit in f(R) theories of gravity

**Authors:** Raul Carpio Fernandez, Alvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07933v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07933v1)

**Summary:**

The so-called Buchdahl limit is not yet fully understood in the context of theories of gravity beyond the Einsteinian framework. In this investigation, we generalize this limit for the case of static, spherically-symmetric, relativistic compact stars. We present a comprehensive analysis that ensures regularity, thermodynamic stability, fulfillment of all required junction conditions and recovery of the Newtonian potential at long distances. Our results are exemplified for the f(R)=R+ alpha R^2 Starobinsky model and several realistic equations of state describing neutron-star matter.

## 13. Brill Waves with Slow Fall-Off Towards Spatial Infinity

**Authors:** Lydia Bieri, David Garfinkle, James Wheeler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07877v1)

**Summary:**

We compute families of solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations of the type of Brill waves. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for physical data. We numerically construct an explicit example with slow-off which does not exhibit antipodal symmetry at spatial infinity. We show that the solution to the vacuum equations does not have a slow fall-off towards spatial infinity, and that it is unique to the Brill waves of this type of wave. We conclude that the Einstein equations do not have slow fall off towards infinity.

## 14. Using the Kaniadakis horizon entropy in the presence of neutrinos to   alleviate the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ Tensions

**Authors:** Muhammad Yarahmadi, Amin Salehi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07860v1)

**Summary:**

The $H_{0}$ tension stands as a prominent challenge in cosmology, serving as a primary driver for exploring alternative models of dark energy. Another tension arises from measurements of the $ S_{8} $ parameter, which is characterize the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe. In this study, we address the alleviation of both the Hubble tension and $ S_8 $ tension by incorporating Kaniadakis horizon entropy. We demonstrate that the value of K may be affected by neutrino mass, which can cause energy transfer.
