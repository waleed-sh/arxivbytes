## 0. Particle production induced by a Lorentzian non-commutative spacetime

**Authors:** A. A. Araújo Filho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19366v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we examine particle production, evaporation, and greybody factors for a Lorentzian non-commutative black hole. We describe Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand metric representation. In this context, we identify the presence of a remnant mass when the black hole reaches the final stage of its evapration. Overall, compared to the Schwarzschild case ($\Theta = 0$), the absence of the non-Commutative parameter $Theta$ lowers the Hawking temperature and reduces the particle creation density.

## 1. Quantum-Corrected Gravitational Interaction Incorporated with a   Non-inertial Cosmic String Spacetime

**Authors:** M. Baradaran, L. M. Nieto, S. Zarrinkamar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19332v1)

**Summary:**

 scalar bosons are considered in a cosmic-string spacetime and in a non-inertial framework. They are involved in a generalized gravitational interaction containing both relativistic and quantum corrections. Solutions for the quantum-corrected gravitational interaction for an arbitrary state are reported in a quasi-exact manner. A discussion of the structure of the problem, whose special case appears in double confluent Heun form, is given. The results are motivated by the great interest in studying quantum and gravitational phenomena in a unified way.

## 2. Wormhole geometries in $f\left(R,T^2\right)$ gravity satisfying the   energy conditions

**Authors:** Nailya Ganiyeva, João Luís Rosa, Francisco S. N. Lobo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19323v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19323v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the properties of traversable wormhole spacetimes within the framework of energy-momentum squared gravity. We demonstrate the existence of a wide range of wormhole solutions that satisfy all of the energy conditions without requiring fine-tuning of the model parameters. We extend our analysis to more intricate dependencies on $T^2$, demonstrating that the methodology remains applicable as long as no mixed terms between $R$ and $T ^2$ are introduced. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results.

## 3. Cosmological Magnetic Fields from Ultralight Dark Matter

**Authors:** Robert Brandenberger, Jürg Fröhlich, Hao Jiao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19310v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a mechanism for the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales. An essential ingredient is an instability (of parametric resonance type) of the electromagnetic field driven by an oscillating pseudo-scalar dark matter field. We find that magnetic fields larger than the observational lower bounds can be generated soon after recombination on scales of $1 {\rm{Mpc}}$. The mechanism is described in the article "Magnetic Fields on Cosmological Scales" published by The Astrophysical Journal.

## 4. Cosmological implications of Tracker scalar fields as dynamical dark   energy

**Authors:** Md. Wali Hossain, Afaq Maqsood

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19274v1)

**Summary:**

The preference for dynamical dark energy over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has gained attention in recent cosmological studies. We investigate this claim by analysing tracker scalar field models, which can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem. We find a mild suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to $CDM but no distinguishing features in the bispectrum. While the inverse axionlike model is preferred over the inverse steep exponential model in terms of statistical evidence, neither provides compelling support for dark energy.

## 5. Chiral symmetry breaking and restoration by helical magnetic fields in   AdS/CFT

**Authors:** Martí Berenguer, Javier Mas, Masataka Matsumoto, Keiju Murata, Alfonso V. Ramallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19197v1)

**Summary:**

Helical magnetic fields can counteract uniform-field-induced symmetry breaking, driving the system towards symmetry restoration. We also find an effect analog to the chiral magnetic effect whereby the current is parallel to the magnetic field. We further study the massive case, and find that the helical configuration is less effective in erasing the first order phase transition that is present in the case of a constant magnetic field in the AdS/QCD framework. The study was conducted using the D3/D7-brane model.

## 6. Generalized black-bounces solutions in f(R) gravity and their field   sources

**Authors:** Marcos V. de S. Silva, T. M. Crispim, G. Alencar, R. R. Landim, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19186v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we studied the possibility of generalizing spherically symmetric and static black-bounce solutions, known from General Relativity, to the $f(R)$ theory in metric formalism. We also analyzed the energy conditions of these solutions and found that, unlike in General Rel relativity, it is possible to satisfy all energy conditions in certain regions of space-time. All the selected models recover Generalrelativity for specific parameter choices. As a result, we demonstrated that black- bounce solutions can emerge from this theory when considering the coupling of gravity with nonlinear electrodynamics.

## 7. Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond   Horndeski Gravity

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155v1)

**Summary:**

We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity. We argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. We discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities. Back to the page you came from.

## 8. Plebanski complex

**Authors:** Kirill Krasnov, Adam Shaw

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19027v1)

**Summary:**

We define and study properties of what we call the Pleba\'nski complex. This is a differential complex that arises by linearisation of the equations implying that a Riemannian 4-manifold is hyper-K\"ahler. We also show that, as in the case with instanton equations, the full Einstein equations also fit into this framework. Supplemented by suitable adjoints, operators assemble into an elliptic operator that squares to the Laplacian and is given by the direct sum of two Dirac operators.

## 9. The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter

**Authors:** Romuald A. Janik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity.

## 10. Implications of σ-cut potential on Antikaon condensates in   neutron stars

**Authors:** Prashant Thakur, Yashmitha Kumaran, Lakshana Sudarsan, Krishna Kunnampully, B. K. Sharma, T. K. Jha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18882v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18882v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensation in the framework of the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) model with a $\sigma$-cut potential. Our present analysis suggests that one can obtain neutron star configurations heavier than 2$M_{\odot}$ with antikino condensates in most cases for $f_{s}$ = 0.6. The calculated global properties of the neutron stars are in resonable agreement with other theoretical and observational data.

## 11. Characterisation of circular light rays in a plasma

**Authors:** Volker Perlick

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18831v1)

**Summary:**

We restrict to the case of an unmagnetised, pressure-free electron-ion plasma. We use two potentials, one for prograde and one for retrograde light rays, whose critical points are exactly the circular light rays in the plasma. In the case that the plasma density vanishes, the corresponding equipotential surfaces reduce to the relativistic Von Zeipel cylinders. The general results are illustrated with examples on Minkowski, Schwarzschild, Kerr and NUT spacetimes.

## 12. Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to   Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling

**Authors:** Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. It could help devise quantum engines, the authors say. The work statistics of many-body systems can be challenging to calculate explicitly, they say.
