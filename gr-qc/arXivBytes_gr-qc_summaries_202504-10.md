## 0. Bound and Scattering States in a Spacetime with Dual Topological   Defects: Cosmic String and Global Monopole

**Authors:** L. G. Barbosa, L. C. N. Santos, J. V. Zamperlini, F. M. da Silva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07075v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07075v1)

**Summary:**

This paper explores the relativistic quantum motion of scalar bosons in the presence of mixed topological defects: cosmic strings and global monopoles. The Klein-Gordon equation with generalized Coulomb potentials is analyzed in this background. Bound state solutions are derived from the poles of the S-matrix. The results indicate that the solutions obtained associated with scattering and bound states depend significantly on the parameters of the topological defect. It also shows how these scenarios impose particular conditions on the existence of bound states.

## 1. Non-Gaussianity of Tensor Induced Density Perturbations

**Authors:** Mariam Abdelaziz, Pritha Bari, Sabino Matarrese, Angelo Ricciardone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07063v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07063v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the non-Gaussianity of second-order matter density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (GWs) These tensor-induced scalar modes arise from local fluctuations in the GWs energy density, which is quadratic. We find that the bispectrum shape is inherently sensitive to the underlying GWs spectrum by construction. Our findings reveal a new way to probe primordial GWs via galaxy surveys and highlight a unique feature of tensor induced density perturbations.

## 2. Thermodynamics of effective loop quantum black holes

**Authors:** F. G. Menezes, H. A. Borges, I. P. R. Baranov, S. Carneiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06964v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06964v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermodynamics of a non-singular black hole model with effective quantum corrections motivated by Loop Quantum Gravity. The effective geometry has a transition surface that connects trapped and anti-trapped regions with the same mass. There is a minimum mass for which the horizon temperature and Komar energy are zero, and the black hole stops its Hawking evaporation. For horizons above this limit, we present the grey-body factors, emission spectra and the mass loss rate, solving a one-dimensional Schrdinger-type equation with an effective short-range potential barrier.

## 3. A post-Newtonian approach to neutron star oscillations

**Authors:** Shanshan Yin, Nils Andersson, Fabian Gittins

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06918v1)

**Summary:**

Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors are expected to constrain the properties of extreme density matter via observations of static and dynamical tides in binary neutron star inspirals. The required modelling is straightforward in Newtonian gravity -- where the tide can be represented in terms of a sum involving the star's oscillation modes. As a step towards more realistic models, we are motivated to explore the post-Newtonian (pN) approach to the problem (noting that the modes should still provide an adequate basis for a tidal expansion up to 2pN order)

## 4. Thermodynamic phase transition and Joule-Thomson expansion of a quantum   corrected black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime

**Authors:** Rui-Bo Wang, Lei You, Shi-Jie Ma, Jian-Bo Deng, Xian-Ru Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06907v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06907v1)

**Summary:**

Thermodynamics in the extended phase space of a quantum corrected black hole (BH) proposed recently is presented in this work. The study shows that the phase transition behavior of the BH is analogous to that of conventional Schwarzschild BH in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The small BH phase exhibiting a negative heat capacity (unstable phase) and the large BHPhase exhibiting a positive heat capacity. Furthermore, owing to the corrected first law, the Gibbs free energy curve becomes smooth near the phase-transition point.

## 5. Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime

**Authors:** Nitesh Kumar Dubey, Sanved Kolekar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887v1)

**Summary:**

We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density   of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian behavior in the HHI state. Further, we observe that the anti-Hawking   effect enhances the entangler between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation   decreases it.

## 6. Probability density function for dispersion measure of fast radio burst   from extragalactic medium

**Authors:** Yuchen Zhang, Yang Liu, Hongwei Yu, Puxun Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06845v1)

**Summary:**

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes in cosmology. An optimized method for extracting the cosmic baryon density from localized FRBs was proposed by Macquart et al. In this Letter, we identify a crucial term that was omitted in their derivation of the probability density function (PDF) for FRBs. We conclude that the omitted term is essential and must be included in order to obtain accurate cosmological constraints from FRB observations.

## 7. Modified gravity realizations of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2

**Authors:** Yuhang Yang, Qingqing Wang, Xin Ren, Emmanuel N. Saridakis, Yi-Fu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06784v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06784v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the realization of quintom scenario for dynamical dark energy within modified gravity theories that can efficiently fit the recent observational datasets. Our results show that, due to its rich structure, modified gravity stands as one of the main candidates for the realization. of the data-favoured dynamicaldark energy. We conclude that modified gravity is a good candidate for the study of the origin of dark energy in the universe. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysics of Light, published by Springer.

## 8. Universal profile for cosmic birefringence tomography with radio   galaxies

**Authors:** Fumihiro Naokawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06709v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06709v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the redshift evolution of the cosmic birefringence angle induced by a slow-rolling pseudoscalar field, which is a candidate for dynamical dark energy, is independent of the detailed model. We find that a sample size of $z\lesssim10$ is required to distinguish the profiles. This is achievable with ongoing and upcoming radio surveys such as ASKAP or SKA. We propose a new method to tomographically probe cosmic biresringence using radio galaxies.

## 9. The curious case of operators with spectral density increasing as   $Ω(E)\sim e^{\,\mathrm{Const.}\, E^2}$

**Authors:** Erik Aurell, Satya N. Majumdar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06623v1)

**Summary:**

We consider what types of operators would have a corresponding spectrum. We find that there are indeed such operators, but of a rather unusual types. For which the wave functions are only barely localized. We point out a tension between such almost delocalized states and black holes as compact objects. We conclude that there is a need for a new theory of black holes to explain how they form in the first place. Back to Mail Online home. Back into the page you came from.

## 10. Graviton stimulated emission in squeezed vacuum states

**Authors:** Atsuhisa Ota, Yuhang Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state in a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. We examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem. Backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission.

## 11. One-Dimensional Relativistic Self-Gravitating Systems

**Authors:** Robert B. Mann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06515v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06515v1)

**Summary:**

Much is known about the relativistic gravitational $N$-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the feature of the absence of gravitational radiation. Relativistic self-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further investigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring many-body systems. The three- body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos, and provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relatvistic chaos can be studied. For $N\geq 4$, other interesting features emerge.
