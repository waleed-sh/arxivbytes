## 0. Symmetry-breaking inflation in non-minimal metric-affine gravity

**Authors:** Ioannis D. Gialamas, Antonio Racioppi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17738v1)

**Summary:**

We study symmetry-breaking inflation within the framework of metric-affine gravity. We introduce a non-minimal coupling between the Holst invariant and the inflaton. Both small-field and large-field inflationary predictions can be brought into agreement with the latest observational constraints. Remarkably, even for sub-Planckian vacuum expectation values, appropriately chosen values of $\beta(\phi)$ enable viable inflation, a scenario previously considered unattainable.

## 1. Stellar collapse with pressure in effective loop quantum gravity

**Authors:** Luca Cafaro, Lorenzo Cipriani, Francesco Fazzini, Farshid Soltani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17678v1)

**Summary:**

We explore semiclassical stellar collapse scenarios with pressure within the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. Numerical investigations show that the shell-focusing singularity characterizing the end state of any classical stellar collapse is here resolved by quantum gravitational effects. However, they also show that shell-crossing singularities remain a general feature of these models and that the inclusion of pressure does not alter the qualitative picture emerging from semiclassico models of inhomogeneous dust collapse. The investigation of the causal structure of the spacetime describing the collapse of a star is inevitably tied to a better understanding of the physics of these shell-Crossing singularity.

## 2. Bekenstein bounds in maximally symmetric nonlinear electrodynamics

**Authors:** Juan Manuel Diaz, Marcelo E. Rubio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17556v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17556v1)

**Summary:**

"ModMax" electrodynamics is the only one that preserves all the symmetries of Maxwell's theory. It has applications in the study of regular black hole solutions and supersymmetry. The purpose of this article is three-fold. We study the initial-value problem of ModMax and show, by means of a simple geometric criterion, that such a theory admits a well-posed formulation. We prove a series of geometric inequalities relating energy, charge, angular momentum, and size in ModMax.

## 3. Spherical photon orbits around Kerr-MOG black hole

**Authors:** Shi-Yu Li, Song-Shan Luo, Zhong-Wen Feng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17520v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17520v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates photon orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes. Numerical analysis reveals that the polar plane has two effective orbits: one outside and one inside the event horizon. In the extremal case, the rotation speed significantly impacts general photon orbits. The results indicate that all orbits are radially unstable, and that the impact parameter of the black hole influences observational properties of a black hole. The study is published in the open-access journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time.

## 4. Finiteness of piecewise flat quantum gravity with matter

**Authors:** Aleksandar Mikovic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17465v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17465v1)

**Summary:**

We review the approach to quantum gravity which is based on the assumption that the short-distance structure of the spacetime is given by a piecewise flat manifold. We then describe the coupling of the Standard Model to this quantum gravity theory and show that the corresponding path integral is finite when the negative power of the product of the edge lengths squared in the path-integral measure is chossen to be grater than 52,5. The implications of this result include a relationship between the effective action and a wavefunction of the universe, the existence of the non-perturbative effective action, and the correct value of the cosmological constant.

## 5. Solar system tests in covariant f(Q) gravity

**Authors:** Wenyi Wang, Kun Hu, Taishi Katsuragawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17463v1)

**Summary:**

We study the Solar System constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity. We investigate the perihelion precession, light deflection, Shapiro delay, Cassini constraint, and gravitational redshift. We place bounds on the parameter $\alpha$ with $n=2, 3$ in our model of $f('Q')$ gravity, using various observational data in the solar system. We conclude that $f'Q' is a model of gravity with a higher nonmetricity-scalar correction.

## 6. Quantum Gravity Signature in a Thermodynamic Observable

**Authors:** Thomas Strasser, Marios Christodoulou, Richard Howl, Caslav Brukner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17460v1)

**Summary:**

Proposed experiments for obtaining empirical evidence for a quantum description of gravity in a table-top setting focus on detecting quantum information signatures. Here, we explore an alternative approach where the quantization of gravity could be inferred through measurements of macroscopic, thermodynamical quantities. To demonstrate the idea, we take as a case study a gravitationally self-interacting Bose gas, and consider its heat capacity. We find a clear-cut distinction between the predictions of a classical gravitational interaction and a quantum gravitational interaction in the heat capacity of the BoseGas.

## 7. Investigation of Super-Poissonian Nonclassical Nature of Inflaton Field   in Flat FRW Universe through Cosmological Mandels $Q$ Parameter

**Authors:** Dhwani Gangal, Sudhava Yadav, K. K. Venkataratnam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17362v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates the nonclassical properties of the inflaton field within the framework of semiclassical gravity. The values of Cosmological Mandels $Q$ are positive shows the super-Poissonian non-classical nature of inflaton. These results provide deeper insights into the statistical properties of quantum states in early-universe cosmology. The results emphasize the relevance of SNS and CSNS in understanding quantum effects on cosmic inflation and particle production. The study was published in The Astrophysical Journal.

## 8. Potential Surge Preheating: enhanced resonance from potential features

**Authors:** Pankaj Saha, Yuko Urakawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17359v1)

**Summary:**

A small feature in the potential can enhance the resonance and bring the radiation-like state equation during preheating despite the inflationary potential being a quadratic one. Such localized features may naturally arise due to various physical effects without altering the large-scale predictions of the original model. These small-scale features leave detectable imprints in the form of gravitational wave signals. These signals influence CMB measurements of the effective number of relativistic species and offer a way to reconstruct the shape of the inflaton potential at small scales.

## 9. Enhancing analogue Unruh effect via superradiance in a cylindrical   cavity

**Authors:** Hong-Tao Zheng, Xiang-Fa Zhou, Guang-Can Guo, Zheng-Wei Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17353v1)

**Summary:**

A circularly rotated Unruh-DeWitt detector enclosed within a cylindrical cavity. This technique relies on the enhanced atomic spontaneous emission rate related to the counter-rotating coupling between the detector and massless scalar fields. Compared to linear acceleration, circular motion can significantly reduce the atomic acceleration path length, leading to increased detection efficiency and lower experimental difficulty. Our method provides a novel avenue for exploring relativistic effects on a compact, tabletop platform. Back to Mail Online home.

## 10. Covariant Canonical Formalism For Born-Infeld Inspired Gravity in   Palatini Formulation

**Authors:** J. Kluson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17294v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17294v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze Born-Infeld inspired gravity in Palatini formulation in the framework of covariant canonical formalism. We determine covariant Hamiltonian and corresponding equations of motion. We conclude that the theory of gravity is consistent with the predictions of quantum gravity. We also show that gravity can be viewed as a form of quantum electrodynamics in the form of a wave function. We then conclude that gravity is a type of wave function that can be described by a Hamiltonian. Theories of gravity can also be expressed as wave functions of quantum mechanics.

## 11. Gravitational waves from a first-order phase transition of the inflaton

**Authors:** JÃ¶rn Kersten, Seong Chan Park, Yeji Park, Juhoon Son, Liliana Velasco-Sevilla

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17278v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the production of gravitational waves resulting from a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in a non-minimally coupled `Dark Higgs Inflation' model. Utilizing a dark sector scalar field as the inflaton, we demonstrate how inflationary dynamics naturally set the stage for observable FOPT. These transitions, influenced by thermal and quantum effects, generate GW spectra potentially detectable by observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope.
