## 0. On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos:   KM3-230213A case study

**Authors:** Giovanni Amelino-Camelia, Giacomo D'Amico, Giuseppe Fabiano, Domenico Frattulillo, Giulia Gubitosi, Alessandro Moia, Giacomo Rosati

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093v1)

**Summary:**

The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of analysis suitable for estimating the significance.

## 1. AInstein: Numerical Einstein Metrics via Machine Learning

**Authors:** Edward Hirst, Tancredi Schettini Gherardini, Alexander G. Stapleton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13043v1)

**Summary:**

A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in that patch, with the associated Einstein conditions. We test our method for the case of spheres represented with 2 patches in dimensions $2,3,4,5$ but it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can be put on spheres in dimension $4, 5.

## 2. Deriving the paradox: original derivation of Hawking radiation

**Authors:** Mariano Cadoni, Salvatore Mignemi, Mirko Pitzalis, Andrea Pierfrancesco Sanna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13026v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit Hawking's original derivation of the evaporation process in a non-stationary spacetime. We present it in a clear and pedagogical manner, with a focus on the spherical collapse of a star into a black hole. Our analysis highlights the underlying assumptions in the calculations, clarifying their physical significance, potential implications, and the limitations of this approach.

## 3. More accurate slow-roll approximations for inflation in scalar-tensor   theories

**Authors:** E. O. Pozdeeva, M. A. Skugoreva, A. V. Toporensky, S. Yu. Vernov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13008v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13008v1)

**Summary:**

We propose new versions of the slow-roll approximation for inflationary models with nonminimally coupled scalar fields. We investigate the inflationary dynamics in the Jordan frame and come to the conclusion that the proposed versions are more accurate at the end of inflation. We also give essentially more precise estimations for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and of the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$, for specific values of the model parameters. For specific values, we use the well-known Higgs-driven inflationary model.

## 4. Probing curved spacetime with a distributed atomic processor clock

**Authors:** Jacob P. Covey, Igor Pikovski, Johannes Borregaard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12954v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12954v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum dynamics on curved spacetime has never been directly probed beyond the Newtonian limit. Although we can describe such dynamics theoretically, experiments would provide empirical evidence that quantum theory holds even in this extreme limit. The practical challenge is the minute spacetime curvature difference over the length scale of the typical extent of quantum effects. Here we propose a quantum network of alkaline earth(-like) atomic processors for constructing a distributed quantum state that is sensitive to the differential proper time between its constituent atomic processor nodes.

## 5. Equivalence of Dark Energy Models: A Theoretical and Bayesian   Perspective

**Authors:** David Tamayo, Erick Urquilla, Isidro Gómez-Vargas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12915v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the background equivalence among three dark energy models by constructing explicit mappings. Using Bayesian analysis with Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Chronometers, our observational constraints confirm that these theoretical equivalences hold at the background level. This study underscores the importance of seeking convergence in darkEnergy models, facilitating a better understanding of the dark sector. We conclude by saying that our results underscore the need for further research into the dark energy sector.

## 6. Late-time behaviors of scalar field modes for a collapsing null shell   spacetime and for the Unruh state in Schwarzschild spacetime

**Authors:** Shohreh Gholizadeh Siahmazgi, Paul R. Anderson, Alessandro Fabbri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12910v1)

**Summary:**

The modes for a massless minimally coupled scalar field are investigated for the Unruh state for Schwarzschild spacetime and the "in" vacuum state for a spacetime in which a spherically symmetric null shell collapses to form a nonrotating black hole. In both cases there are two different sets of solutions to the mode equation that make up the state. For both spacetimes, one set of modes oscillates forever with no damping of the oscillations and the other set approaches zero at late times.

## 7. Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings   with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a   multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model

**Authors:** Geng-Chen Wang, Hong-Bo Jin, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828v1)

**Summary:**

Detecting gravitational wave background from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors.

## 8. Geometric Flavours of Quantum Field Theory on a Cauchy Hypersurface:   Gaussian Analysis for the Hamiltonian Formalism and Applications to Cosmology

**Authors:** David Martínez-Crespo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760v1)

**Summary:**

This thesis explores Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on curved spacetimes. In particular it studies the theory of the scalar field described through its configurations over a Cauchy hypersurface. It is focused on mathematical consistency based on analytic and geometric tools. The work begins by extending the Koopman-van Hove formalism of classical statistical mechanics to CSFT. It reveals features inherent to both CSFT and QFT, that help delineate the genuine quantum features of a theory.

## 9. Probing Chaos in Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime: The Role of Black   Hole and Cosmological Horizons

**Authors:** Surojit Dalui, Soumya Bhattacharya, Chiranjeeb Singha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12758v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12758v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the motion of a massless, chargeless particle in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. Poincar\'e sections show regular Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori when black hole and cosmological horizons are distant, but distortions and chaos emerge as they converge. Our findings indicate that as the closeness of the two horizons increases, the most prominent Lyapunov exponent also increases.

## 10. Intermediate Coupling Regime in Dilatonic $f(R,T)$ Inflationary Universe

**Authors:** Francisco A. Brito, Carlos H. A. B. Borges, Jose A. V. Campos, Francisco G. Costa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12720v1)

**Summary:**

In the present work we study cosmology in dilatonic $f(R,T)$ gravity to address the inflationary phase of the early Universe. As usual, in Dilatonic gravity the scalar potential assumes the exponential form. However, this potential is not good enough to be in accord with the Planck 2018 data. More strikingly, the generalized $f$-exponential cannot take this into account either. It is just the presence of the dil atonic sector, in the intermediate coupling regime, that can help the theory to be fully accord with observational data.

## 11. Black Hole Chemistry Knows Extra Dimensions

**Authors:** Kyung Kiu Kim, Jeongwon Ho, Seungjoon Hyun, Taehyeon Song

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12687v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12687v1)

**Summary:**

In this note, we study an extra dimension effect on the black hole chemistry in the 8-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Maxwell theory. The extra-dimension size determines thermodynamic pressure, and the thermodynamic volume is roughly the horizon size of black holes. In addition, we discuss the zeroth-order phase transition of the 4-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole. We focus on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes for the effective 4- dimensional model obtained by a dimensional reduction.

## 12. Two-Component Theory of Classical Gravitons with Arbitrary Sources

**Authors:** Clésio E. Mota, Jorge G. Cardoso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12656v1)

**Summary:**

A review of the spin curvatures that arise in the framework of the Infeld-van der Waerden {\epsilon}-formalism for general relativity is presented. The sourceful extension formulated in an earlier work of the theory of gravitons in vacuum is then reviewed in a concise way. At this stage the system of gravitational wave equations obtained thereabout is replicated on the basis of the implementation of the same calculational techniques. An important symmetry property borne by the right-hand sides of those wave equations is subsequently brought forward.

## 13. Can wormholes mirror the quasi-normal mode spectrum of Schwarzschild   black holes?

**Authors:** Ciro De Simone, Vittorio De Falco, Salvatore Capozziello

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12646v1)

**Summary:**

Wormholes are exotic compact objects characterized by the absence of essential singularities and horizons, acting as slender bridges linking two distinct regions of spacetime. Despite their theoretical significance, they remain however undetected, possibly due to their ability to closely mimic the observational properties of black holes. This study explores whether a static and spherically symmetric wormhole within General Relativity can reproduce the quasi-normal mode spectrum of a Schwarzschild black hole under scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations.

## 14. Strong primordial inhomogeneities induced by axion-like scalar field

**Authors:** Maxim A. Krasnov, Maxim Yu. Khlopov, Oem Trivedi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12610v1)

**Summary:**

We use Axion-like particle (ALP) model to investigate the behaviour of space-time in the vicinity of the domain wall. Here we present first-step approximation in our analysis and discuss the applicability of thin-shell approximation. We conclude with a discussion on how to use the model to understand the universe. We hope that this article has helped you understand the theory of the universe more fully. Back to the page you came from. Click here to read the rest of the article.

## 15. Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves   with CMB

**Authors:** Ashu Kushwaha, Rajeev Kumar Jain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517v1)

**Summary:**

Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. We propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter.

## 16. Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity

**Authors:** Daniele Oriti, Xiankai Pang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12419v1)

**Summary:**

We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmology puzzles. We show how the phantom phase produced by our quantumgravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension.
