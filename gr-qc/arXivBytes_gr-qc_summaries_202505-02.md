## 0. Simple Holography in General Spacetimes

**Authors:** Raphael Bousso, Elisa Tabor

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695v1)

**Summary:**

The simple or "outermost" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement wedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Given an input wedge $a$ analogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest wedge accessible by a "zigzag," a certain sequence of antinormal light-sheets. So far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in time-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of holographic encoding by tensor networks.

## 1. Joint inference for gravitational wave signals and glitches using a   data-informed glitch model

**Authors:** Ann-Kristin Malz, John Veitch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00657v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise transients, glitches, which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal parameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing step, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis. In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to build a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known glitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference analysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously.

## 2. The equations of Einstein and Cartan

**Authors:** D C Robinson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00617v1)

**Summary:**

A formulation of Einstein's gravitational field equations in four space-time dimensions is presented using generalized differential forms and Cartan's equations for metric geometries. When the energy-momentum tensor is zero the generalized connections can be chosen to be flat and different solutions can be related by generalizations of the Poincar\'e group. An action for the vacuum field equations is constructed by generalizing the Nieh-Yan three-form. They are then employed to represent Einstein's field equations and their solutions.

## 3. Dark matter as a vector field: an action principle for the Einstein   cluster

**Authors:** Pedro G. S. Fernandes, Vitor Cardoso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00563v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00563v1)

**Summary:**

We show that a vector field non-minimally coupled to gravity reproduces the dynamics of an Einstein cluster. Our results suggest a vectorial nature for dark matter. The results suggest that dark matter may have a non-majoritarian nature. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Dark Matter and Space (ASMDS), which is published by the journal of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS).

## 4. Can We Probe Spacetime Non-commutativity Through Tidal Deformability of   Compact Objects?

**Authors:** Junting Peng, Yanbo Zhao, Antonino Marciano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the feasibility of detecting non-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We consider NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge theory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. We then compute the NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several different models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction dominates the tidal deformable of a compact object near the black-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars are not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-Commutativity.

## 5. Quantum Corrected Geodesic Motion in Polymer Kerr-like Spacetime

**Authors:** Zhiyang Guo, Chen Lan, Yan Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00437v1)

**Summary:**

A Kerr-like solution that incorporates quantum gravity effects is essential for constructing realistic models. We analyze the geodesic motion of massive particles in a Kerr- like polymer spacetime. We demonstrate that increasing $A_\lambda$ allows for additional orbital evolution in extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems before merging. This work contributes to the understanding of quantumgravity effects and offers potential observational signatures, particularly in the study of EMRIs. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 6. On the structure of big bang singularities in spatially homogenous   solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations

**Authors:** Hans Ringström

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00429v1)

**Summary:**

This article looks at the structure of big bang singularities in spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations. We prove that solutions are either vacuum or matter dominated, depending on whether the limit of an expansion normalised normal derivative is zero or not. Initial data on the singularity thus play a central role in the analysis; they both parameterise developments and give optimal asymptotic information. However, the article contains substantial additional information, such as, e.g., the construction of a large class of spatially locally homogenous solutions that can be demonstrated to be globally non-linearly stable.

## 7. Primordial black hole formation from a type II perturbation in the   absence and presence of pressure

**Authors:** Koichiro Uehara, Albert Escrivà, Tomohiro Harada, Daiki Saito, Chul-Moon Yoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00366v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed from extremely large amplitudes of primordial curvature fluctuations, classified as type II. Type II fluctuations differ from type I by the presence of a stationary point on the initial time slice. Starting from these type II perturbations to form black holes, the nonlinear evolution governed by the Einstein equations generally results in two distinct types, A and B, of horizon configurations. However, this equivalence does not generally hold in the Presence of Pressure.

## 8. Interactions of the scalaron dark matter in $f (R)$ gravity

**Authors:** Yuri Shtanov, Yurii Sheiko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00324v1)

**Summary:**

The scalaron could account for all dark matter if its mass lies in the meV$\unicode{x2013}$MeV range. In this work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model particles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. We also estimate the contribution of primordial thermal scalarons to the present dark matter density and find it to be negligible. This supports the original scenario in which the Scalaron dark matter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.

## 9. Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to   Neutrino-cooled Flows

**Authors:** Luciano Combi, Christopher Thompson, Daniel M. Siegel, Alexander Philippov, B. Ripperda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00300v1)

**Summary:**

When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas forms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and temperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be converted to neutrinos. At low accretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak magnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic field mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the atmosphere.

## 10. Gravitational radiations from periodic orbits around Einstein-Æther   black holes

**Authors:** Shuo Lu, Tao Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00294v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00294v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave emission from the periodic orbital motion of a test particle around two specific types of black holes. Modified gravity that locally breaks Lorentz symmetry while remaining consistent with theoretical and observational constraints. Higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures, authors say. The presence of the \ae{}ther field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be potentially tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors, they say.

## 11. A polytopal discrete de Rham scheme for the exterior calculus Einstein's   equations

**Authors:** Todd A. Oliynyk, Jia Jia Qian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00286v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, based on the $3+1$ decomposition in [23, 32], we present a fully exterior calculus breakdown of spacetime and Einstein's equations. Links to the orthonormal frame approach [37] are drawn to help understand the variables in this context. Two formulations are derived, discretised and tested using the exterior calculus discrete de Rham complex [12]. Some discrete quantities are shown to be conserved in one of the cases, and some discrete quantities in another.

## 12. Shadow and geometric scattering analysis of a new black hole with   magnetic charge

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00280v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain a newly charged black hole with magnetic charge $q$ and coupling constant $mu$ from the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics theory. We perform the shadow and geometric scattering analysis of this black hole. There is the naked singularity (NS) arisen from the magnetic charge extension of the photon spheres for the 3 and 4-branches. In case of $q<1$, shadow radii of the $2$-branch with $\mu$=0.01 and 0.1 are the same as that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, while the 3-NS branch is constrained by the EHT observation.
