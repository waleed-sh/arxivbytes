## 0. Average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem in a constrained pure   Gaussian state ensemble

**Authors:** Erik Aurell, Lucas Hackl, Mario Kieburg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03696v1)

**Summary:**

Ensembles of pure Gaussian states parametrized by single-mode marginals and (optionally) specific mode-mode correlations. Such ensembles provide a model for the final states when isolated quantum systems thermalize, as they can reproduce thermal properties locally, while being globally pure. By an analysis using real replicas we show that the average entanglement entropy is the same as the von Neumann entropy of a mixed Gaussian state with the same marginals, but no correlations.

## 1. Supermassive black hole in NGC 4649 (M60) with a dark matter halo:   Impact on shadow measurements and thermodynamic properties

**Authors:** Francisco S. N. Lobo, Jorde A. A. Ramos, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03661v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate black hole (BH) solutions embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo. The DM density profile is constrained by Hubble Space Telescope data, stellar dynamics, and globular cluster (GC) measurements of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60) Using this profile, we construct two distinct spacetime solutions characterized by the black hole mass ($M$), critical velocity ($V_c$), and core radius ($a$) These results underscore the role of DM in shaping both geometric and thermodynamic aspects of BHs.

## 2. Consequences of non-minimal coupling for mass mixing in spontaneous   baryogenesis

**Authors:** Mattia Dubbini, Orlando Luongo, Marco Muccino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03644v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the impact of a non-minimal Yukawa-like coupling between curvature and inflaton field within the baryogenesis background. We demonstrate that this coupling leads to a significant enhancement in particle production, even for small values of the coupling constant. As a further outcome, we find that the non-Minimal Yukwa coupling also leads to the renormalization of the inflaton mass and weakly influences the bounds over the gravitational constant. Since the fermionic fields appear not to be mass eigenstates, we specialize the mass-mixing between them only. To this end, we thus include the effects of mass- mixing and cosmic expansion into our calculations.

## 3. Keeping the relation between the Starobinsky model and no-scale   supergravity ACTive

**Authors:** Ioannis D. Gialamas, Theodoros Katsoulas, Kyriakos Tamvakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03608v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an additional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term. We analyze the inflationary predictions of the model and find that the modified model is in full agreement with the recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. For a range of $e$-folds, $N_\star = 50-60$. We find that for $-4.2 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lessSim -1.9 \times 8.9$.

## 4. Slowly Rotating Neutron Stars in Aether Scalar-Tensor Theory

**Authors:** Christopher Reyes, Jeremy Sakstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03527v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03527v1)

**Summary:**

Aether Scalar-Tensor theory behaves like cold dark matter on cosmological scales. Theory correctly predicts the cosmic microwave background and linear matter power spectra. Theory predicts approximate universal relations between the moment of inertia and the compactness that differ from their general relativity counterparts. These relations may enable tests of the theory using X-ray observations of pulsars and gravitational wave observations of binary neutron star mergers. The theory is a relativistic alternative gravity model that predicts the MOND force-law.

## 5. Who's afraid of a negative lapse?

**Authors:** Robert Beig, Piotr T. Chruściel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03516v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03516v1)

**Summary:**

We rederive the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner equations in a framework in which the zeros of the lapse are innocuous, whether with or without changes of sign. We show how to relate solutions of the Anderson-York equations to the maximal globally hyperbolic development of the initial data. The causality properties of the resulting equations are explored. We provide a well posed system of tensorial evolution equations with a freely prescribable shift vector and densitised lapse.

## 6. Development of a polarimetry method toward in-situ substrate   birefringence characterization of ground-based gravitational wave detectors

**Authors:** Satoshi Tanioka, Terri Pearce, Keiko Kokeyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03491v1)

**Summary:**

In-situ birefringence characterization can become an essential diagnostic tool for detector performance. The scheme proposed and demonstrated in this paper can be used as a diagnostic tool in large-scale gravitational wave detectors. We also discuss possible technological developments toward implementation in future gravitational wave detector. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Gravitational Wave Astronomy and Particle Physics (ASW/PASW) – a peer-reviewed journal of the American Association for Astrophysical Research.

## 7. Vacuum Polarization Effects During the Reheating Epoch

**Authors:** A. B. Arbuzov, A. A. Nikitenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03453v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03453v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum effects during the epoch of the unviverse reheating after inflation are considered. A semiclassical approach to the theory of gravity is applied in connection with the Starobinsky inflation model. Some subtleties associated with taking into account quantum effects in the one-loop approximation are clarified. An estimate of the contribution of vacuum polarization in the energy-momentum tensor of matter fields to the scalaron decay width is presented. The results of the study are published in the Journal of Quantum Theory.

## 8. Universal Cosmologies

**Authors:** Paul Marconnet, Dimitrios Tsimpis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03449v1)

**Summary:**

Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema. These models generally possess many desirable features, including parametric control of e-folds and late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universalcosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential for an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature) to include other types of supergravity. We show that these models can be repackaged as solutions of 4d models.

## 9. Investigating Graviton Mass Effects on Black Hole Lensing in dRGT   Massive Gravity

**Authors:** Haximjan Abdusattar, Yu-Xuan Han, Abdujappar Rusul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03386v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational lensing and photon trajectories in the vicinity of non-asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes within the framework of dRGT massive gravity. We assume that both the observer and the light source are located at a finite distance from the lens object. We calculate the gravitational deflection angle of light ray by such a black hole based on Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We derive the angular radius of Einstein rings associated with black holes in dR GT massive gravity, thereby facilitating a comprehensive discussion on the ramifications of the graviton mass.

## 10. Generalization of Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Gravity Effective Action

**Authors:** Aleksandar Mikovic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03305v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) formulation of quantum mechanics to the case of quantum gravity (QG) This is done by replacing the dBB equations of motion with the effective action equations ofmotion. In this way one avoids the violations of the Heisenberg uncertainity relations and the absence of the classical trajectories for stationary bound states. The proposed QG generalization is natural for Bohmiam mechanics because a dBB wavefunction is really a wavefunction of the Universe.

## 11. Deep learning spinfoam vertex amplitudes: the Euclidean Barrett-Crane   model

**Authors:** Hanno Sahlmann, Waleed Sherif

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255v1)

**Summary:**

Spinfoam theories propose a well-defined path-integral formulation for quantum gravity. However, it is computationally hard to calculate spinfoam amplitudes. We explore a data-driven approach to acceleratingspinfoam computations. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression task. Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude is zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The trained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for future work.
