## 0. Quantitative classicality in cosmological interactions during inflation

**Authors:** Yoann L. Launay, Gerasimos I. Rigopoulos, E. Paul S. Shellard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the classical and quantum evolution of inflationary cosmological perturbations from quantum initial conditions. We calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order bispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by the on-shell evolution. The insights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying the validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations in inflation. We also show how stochastic dynamics can emerge as a sufficient approximation to the full quantum evolution.

## 1. The Classical Super-Rotation Infrared Triangle

**Authors:** Sangmin Choi, Alok Laddha, Andrea Puhm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16142v1)

**Summary:**

In four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes the infinite enhancement of translations, extending the Poincar\'e group to the BMS group, is the symmetry underlying Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and the gravitational displacement memory effect. Beyond this leading infrared triangle, loop corrections alter their nature by introducing logarithms in the soft expansion and late time tails to the memory, and this persists in the classical limit. In this work we give the first complete description of an `infrared triangle' where the long-range nature of gravitational interactions is accounted for.

## 2. Henneaux-Teitelboim Form of the Generalized Unimodular Gravity Action

**Authors:** Dmitry Nesterov, Ksenia Lyamkina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16139v1)

**Summary:**

We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG) The central feature of this formulation is the consistent incorporation of time reparameterization. This enhances the gauge structure and reveals a spatial nonlocality hidden in the original formulation. We identify a subset of GUMG models for which the alternative formulation preserves manifest locality. We show that the gauge symmetry in the gravitational sector is extended by a functionally incomplete symmetry, as occurs in the unimodularity gravity. We examine the resulting dynamics, emphasizing the effects of spatial non Locality.

## 3. Asymptotic T-duality in three dimensions

**Authors:** Stéphane Detournay, José Figueroa, Alejandro Vilar López

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16136v1)

**Summary:**

In (super)gravity theories, T-duality relates solutions with an exact isometry which can have wildly different asymptotic behaviors. A well-known example is the duality between BTZ black holes and (non-extremal) three-dimensional black strings. Using this dual pair, we show how the knowledge of a phase space which includes one set of solutions can be used to obtain a dual set. On the way, we find a large algebra of symmetries for the black string phase space.

## 4. Comparing effective-one-body and Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon results for   a spinning test particle on circular equatorial orbits around a Kerr black   hole

**Authors:** Angelica Albertini, Viktor Skoupý, Georgios Lukes-Gerakopoulos, Alessandro Nagar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16077v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a spinning test particle around a rotating black hole. We compare the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) formalism to the test-mass limit of the effective-one-body (EOB) Hamiltonian. We find no difference between the EOB and MPD fluxes when the background spacetime is Schwarzschild, while the difference for a Kerr background is maximum for large, positive spins. Our work could be considered as a first step to improve the radiation reaction of the E OB model.

## 5. Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Size Dark Matter   Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum

**Authors:** Jianhao Wu, Tsang Keung Chan, Victor J. Forouhar Moreno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072v1)

**Summary:**

Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies formed at high redshift. These could challenge the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. In this study, we conduct high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host size halos. We find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for sub halo masses.

## 6. One-loop corrections to near extremal Kerr thermodynamics from   semiclassical Virasoro blocks

**Authors:** Paolo Arnaudo, Giulio Bonelli, Alessandro Tanzini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16057v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse in detail four-dimensional Kerr black hole and show that in the near-extremal limit a branch of long-lived modes arises. We prove that the contribution of these modes accounts for a correction to the entropy for massless particles of spin $s=1,2$. In the full calculation performed in the exact Kerr background the leading contribution actually is sourced by theNear-horizon region only, and as such has a universal validity for any asymptotic behavior at infinity.

## 7. Discriminating between different modified dispersion relations from   gamma-ray observations

**Authors:** S. Caroff, C. Pfeifer, J. Bolmont, T. Terzić, A. Campoy-Ordaz, D. Kerszberg, M. Martinez, U. Pensec, C. Plard, J. Strišković, S. Wong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16048v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16048v1)

**Summary:**

The standard dispersion relation for photons in vacuum could be modified because of their interaction with the quantum nature of spacetime. A quantitative model has been tested extensively using distant highly energetic astrophysical sources, searching for energy-dependent time delays in photon arrival times. This article introduces a general parameterization of modified dispersion relations in cosmological symmetry, which directly leads to a general lag versus redshift dependence encompassing both existing and new models. This could be used in the future to compare the predicted time lags of the different models and test them against observations.

## 8. Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D   Integrals

**Authors:** Matthew Reinhard, Zachary Slepian, Jiamin Hou, Alessandro Greco

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037v1)

**Summary:**

Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. We investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field.

## 9. Ti and Spi, Carrollian extended boundaries at timelike and spatial   infinity

**Authors:** Jack Borthwick, Maël Chantreau, Yannick Herfray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we provide a definition for a notion of extended boundary at time and space-like infinity. This definition applies to asymptotically flat spacetime in the sense of Ashtekar--Romano and we wish to demonstrate, by example, its pertinence in a number of situations. Ti and Spi are both naturally equipped with (strong) Carrollian geometries which, under mild assumptions, enable to reduce the symmetry group down to the BMS group or to Poincar\'e in the flat case.

## 10. Effective Metric Description of 2+1 Dimensional Quantum Black Holes

**Authors:** Stefan Hohenegger, Mikolaj Myszkowski, Mattia Damia Paciarini, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960v1)

**Summary:**

We develop an effective metric description of 2+1 dimensional black holes. It describes deviations from the classical Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. The effective metric is constrained by imposing the black hole symmetries and asymptotic classical behavior. We show how to recast the information encoded in a specific model of quantum BTZ known as quBTZ black hole in terms of the effective metric coefficients. This allows us to further derive the general form of the corrected Hawking temperature.

## 11. Chaotic orbital dynamics of pulsating stars around black holes   surrounded by dark matter halos

**Authors:** Tiago S. Amancio, Ricardo A. Mosna, Ronaldo S. S. Vieira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15938v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15938v1)

**Summary:**

Melnikov's method shows that its orbital dynamics presents homoclinic chaos near the corresponding unstable circular orbits. The chaotic nature of its orbit, due to pulsation, is imprinted in the redshift time series of the emitted light. Although our results were obtained for a specific exact solution, we argue that this phenomenon is generic for pulsating bodies immersed in black hole spacetimes surrounded by self-gravitating fluids. It can, in principle, be observed in the corresponding light curves and even in gravitational-wave signals.

## 12. Astrometric constraints on stochastic gravitational wave background with   neural networks

**Authors:** Marienza Caldarola, Gonzalo Morrás, Santiago Jaraba, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Savvas Nesseris, Juan García-Bellido

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15879v1)

**Summary:**

Astrometric measurements provide a unique avenue for constraining the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) In this work, we investigate the application of two neural network architectures, a fully connected network and a graph neural network, for analyzing astrometric data to detect the SGWB. We evaluate the performance of both models under varying input datasets to assess their robustness across different configurations. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively measure the SG WB, showing promise as tools for addressing systematic uncertainties and modeling limitations.

## 13. Entanglement harvesting in quantum superposed spacetime

**Authors:** Anwesha Chakraborty, Lucas Hackl, Magdalena Zych

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15870v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15870v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the phenomenon of entanglement harvesting for a spacetime in quantum superposition. We use two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum scalar field. We find that it reaches its maximum when we condition the final spacetime superposition state to match the initial spacetime state. Our results demonstrate that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance entangler for both twisted and untwisted field. For the twisted field, the parameter region without entanglements exhibits a significant deviation from that observed in classical Minkowski space or a single quotient Minksowski space.

## 14. Free fall in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity

**Authors:** Nivaldo A. Lemos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15805v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15805v1)

**Summary:**

 modified symmetric teleparallel gravity does not obey the equivalence principle in the sense of Weinberg. In this theory, minimum length geodesics are distinct from autoparallel geodesICS. The structure of the theory makes it inevitable that a freely falling test particle follows a shortest path, a geodesic of the metric. This also has bearing on whether, under appropriate conditions, this theory is fully equivalent to general relativity. The equations that govern the motion of a freely Falling test particle involve the Levi-Civita connection, not some other connection.

## 15. Pure connection formalism and Plebanski's second heavenly equation

**Authors:** Kirill Krasnov, Arthur Lipstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15779v1)

**Summary:**

Plebanski's second heavenly equation reduces the problem of finding a self-dual Einstein metric to solving a non-linear second-order PDE for a single function. We provide a new simple derivation of both versions of the PlebanskiSecond heavenly equation. Our derivation relies on the `pure connection' description of self- dual gravity. Our results also suggest a new interpretation to the kinematic algebra of self.dual Yang-Mills theory. The Lie algebra of (0,1) vector fields on a R4 endowed with a complex structure.

## 16. Heat and work in black hole thermodynamics via holography

**Authors:** Tomohiro Shigemura, Keito Shimizu, Sotaro Sugishita, Daichi Takeda, Takuya Yoda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15697v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15697v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a formulation of black hole thermodynamics that incorporates the notions of heat and work. This formulation relies on holography, but not on energy conditions on the gravity side. We also argue that the second law serves as a necessary criterion for the UV completeness of gravitational theories. We construct a thermodynamic framework for composite black hole systems that encompasses both heat and Work. We then translate the resulting thermodynamics into the AdS gravity language. We conclude that the thermodynamics of holographic CFTs is consistent with quantum theory and the CFT correspondence.

## 17. Non-linear effects on the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background   anisotropies

**Authors:** Alina Mierna, Sabino Matarrese, Nicola Bartolo, Angelo Ricciardone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15654v1)

**Summary:**

The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anis tropies at large scales. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbation are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect.

## 18. The imprint of cosmic expansion history on the propagation of   gravitational waves

**Authors:** Ye Jiang, Wen-Biao Han

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15578v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves (GWs) are regarded as standard sirens for Cosmology. For the first time, we explore how the expansion of the Universe affects GW propagation by perturbing the Robertson-Walker metric. We achieve a comprehensive and rigorous formalism at the next-leading order to describe the cosmological acceleration in GWs from any kind of sources. Theoretically, this effect will obviously amplify GWs at frequencies as low as $10^{-12}$ Hz.

## 19. Dynamics of the order parameter in symmetry breaking phase transitions

**Authors:** Fumika Suzuki, Wojciech H. Zurek

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568v1)

**Summary:**

The formation of topological defects in second-order phase transitions can be investigated by solving partial differential equations. The temporal evolution of the order parameter predicts the essence of the adiabatic-impulse scenario, including the scaling of the freeze-out time. The spatial part of the evolution, in turn, leads to the characteristic size of domains that choose the same broken symmetry. The finding enables the exploration of Kibble-Zurek scaling using ordinary differential equations over a large range of quench timescales.

## 20. Algebras and states in super-JT gravity

**Authors:** Geoff Penington, Edward Witten

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549v1)

**Summary:**

In bosonic JT gravity, minimally coupled to bulk matter, there exists a single, delta-function-normalisable state in each $SL(2,R)$ representation of the matter QFT for any pair of positive energies $E_L, E_R$ at the left and right boundaries. Projecting the algebras of boundary observables onto these zero-energy states leads to a Type II$_1$ von Neumann factor at each boundary that contains a single operator for each supersymmetric matter boundary primary with sufficiently small R-charge.

## 21. Blowing-up solutions of Klein-Gordon equations with gauge variant   semilinear terms in Friedmann-Lemaítre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes under   finite speed of propagation

**Authors:** Makoto Nakamura, Takuma Yoshizumi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15522v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15522v1)

**Summary:**

Blowing-up solutions of Klein-Gordon equations with gauge variant semilinear terms are considered in Friedmann-Lema\'itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Effects of spatial expansion or contraction on the solutions are studied through the scale-function and the curved mass. For example, the equations can be written as: Klein-Gordon equations with gauge variant Semilin terms as: Friedmann Lema itre Robertson Walker spacetimes 1.

## 22. Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the   observer-dependence of gravitational entropy

**Authors:** Julian De Vuyst, Stefan Eccles, Philipp A. Hoehn, Josh Kirklin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent, according to the authors. The entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. We also describe anantisemiclassical regime, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy. In this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. The authors conclude that gravitational entropy is a significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy.

## 23. A Methodological Framework for Solving Einsteins Equations in Axially   Symmetric Spacetimes

**Authors:** J. Ospino, J. L. Hernández-Pastora, A. V. Araujo-Salcedo, L Núñez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15480v1)

**Summary:**

This work presents a novel methodology for deriving stationary and axially symmetric solutions to Einstein field equations using the 1+3 tetrad formalism. This approach reformulates the Einstein equations into first order scalar equations, enabling systematic resolution in vacuum scenarios. We derive two distinct solutions in polar and hyperbolic geometries by assuming the separability of a key metric function. We explore the role of Killing tensors in enabling separable metric components, simplifying analyses of geodesic motion and physical phenomena.
