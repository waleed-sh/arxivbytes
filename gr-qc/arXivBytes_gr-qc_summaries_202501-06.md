## 0. A New Approach to the Analysis of Cosmological Parameters in Multifield   Cosmology

**Authors:** Katerina Bolshakova, Sergey Chervon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01948v1)

**Summary:**

Currently, a method has been developed for the cosmological inflation model with a single scalar field. But for a multifield configuration, a definitive method has not yet been established. We propose a new effective algorithm for determining cosmologically parameters within the tensor-multi-scalar theory of gravity, which describes the early inflationary epoch of the Universe. Our approach is based on utilizing a specific analytical solution within the multifield cosmology model to establish functional relationships between fields. This method enables the computation of cosmologists and their comparison with observational data.

## 1. Quasi-topological fractons: a 3D dipolar gauge theory

**Authors:** Erica Bertolini, Alberto Blasi, Nicola Maggiore

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01944v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the theory of a generic rank-2 tensor field in three spacetime dimensions. Despite the fact that the theory is not topological, the energy-momentum tensor vanishes on-shell, which justifies the quasi-topological appellation we give to this theory. We find an interesting physical interpretation, which consists in a generalized planar electromagnetism and in the emergence of two vector charges with restricted mobility. These are typical fractonic behaviours which can be related to the so called traceless scalar and vector charge theories.

## 2. Constraining the Gravitational Wave Speed in the Early Universe via   Gravitational Cherenkov Radiation

**Authors:** Paola C. M. Delgado, Alexander Ganz, Chunshan Lin, Roxane Th√©riault

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01910v1)

**Summary:**

 Scalar particles traveling faster than a subluminal gravitational wave generate gravitons via gravitational Cherenkov radiation. We find that for the minimal model, where only the speed of gravitational waves is modified, the relic graviton background can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, but still agrees with the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound in most cases. By requiring the relic Graviton background to remain consistent with the BBN constraint, we derive limits on the gravitational wave speed at early times.

## 3. Non-Standard Thermal History and Formation of Primordial Black Holes in   Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity

**Authors:** Yogesh, Abolhassan Mohammadi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01867v1)

**Summary:**

Inflation provides a suitable environment for the formation of Primordial Black Holes(PBHs) PBHs can be attributed to $100\% $ dark matter present in the universe. The generated perturbations during inflation re-enter the horizons after the end of inflation, where the universe may be in a non-standard epoch rather than the radiation-dominant phase. The presented model is capable of predicting PBH formation in a wide range mass, from $10 to $10.

## 4. More on Analytically Approximate Solution to Quadratic Gravity

**Authors:** Seyed Naseh Sajadi, Supakchai Ponglertsakul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01829v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we obtain the analytically approximation of static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions to Einstein$-$Weyl squared gravity. Black hole solutions are found for various relations between near horizon parameters with positive Weyl's coupling constant. A non-Schwarzschild solution appears when the integration constant reaches a certain value for arbitrary values of the coupling constant {$\alpha$}. In addition, we study the thermodynamic and dynamical stability of the black hole Solutions.

## 5. Stueckelberg field and Cosmology

**Authors:** T R Govindarajan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01756v1)

**Summary:**

Stueckelberg introduced an axion like scalar field to provide mass to the gauge electromagnetic field without breaking gauge invariance. This can be considered as a precursor to the spontaneously broken abelian Higgs model. We will consider its role in cosmology to provide a novel candidate to the dark matter question. In addition its implications to deeper issues will be pointed out. We hope this article has helped you understand some of the implications of this article.

## 6. Scrambling in charged hairy black holes and the Kasner interior

**Authors:** Hadyan Luthfan Prihadi, Donny Dwiputra, Fitria Khairunnisa, Freddy Permana Zen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01680v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar coupling constant, and charge density from Maxwell field affect the chaotic feature of a charged hairy black hole. Due to relevant deformation in the boundary theory, the bulk solution flows into more general Kasner spacetime in the interior of the black hole, near the singularity. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and calculate the out-of-time-ordered correlators holographically, which can probe chaos.

## 7. Gravitational Wave Scattering From the Sun and Planets

**Authors:** Daniel A. Kessler, Craig J. Copi, Glenn D. Starkman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01585v1)

**Summary:**

General relativity predicts that massless waves should scatter from the Riemann curvature of their backgrounds. These scattered waves are sometimes called $\textit{tails}$ and have never been directly observed. Here we calculate the gravitational waves scattered in the backward direction. We estimate that scattering from the Sun and the planets from Jupiter to Neptune could contribute a $10^{-3}$ amplitude modulation to LISA observations when these objects almost intersect the line of sight between LISA and the source. These conditions should be realized for the Sun during the lifetime of LISA.
