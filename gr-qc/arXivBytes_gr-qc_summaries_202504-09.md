## 0. Nonlinear Tails of Gravitational Waves in Schwarzschild Black Hole   Ringdown

**Authors:** Alex Kehagias, Antonio Riotto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06224v1)

**Summary:**

 Schwarzschild black holes evolve toward their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, which decay over time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We derive this power law analytically for the second-order even gravitational perturbations, demonstrating that it is determined by the fact that theSecond-order source decays as the inverse square of the distance. Quadratic gravitational modes with multipole $\ell$ decay according to a law $\sim t^{-2\ell-1}$, in contrast to the linear Price law scaling. Consequently, nonlinear tails may persist longer than their linear counterparts.

## 1. Generalized Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole solution in the   scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet $4d$ gravitational model

**Authors:** K. K. Ernazarov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06223v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the sEGB $4d$ gravitational model with a scalar field. The model action contains a potential term and a Gauss-Bonnet coupling function. We prove that for all non-trivial values of the parameter $C_0, the function $h\left(u\right)$ is not of constant sign for all admissible $u$ We also find expressions for $U\left(\varphi) and $Varepsilon = 1$ for a fixed value of theparameter.

## 2. Equivalence between the timelike Brunn-Minkowski inequality and timelike   Bakry-Émery-Ricci lower bound on weighted globally hyperbolic spacetimes

**Authors:** Osama Farooqui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06186v1)

**Summary:**

We prove that the timelike Brunn-Minkowski inequality implies a lower bound on the Bakry-\'Emery-Ricci curvature on weighted globally hyperbolic spacetimes. This result, together with the well-known equivalence between the lower bounds and the $\mathsf{TCD}(K,N)$ condition, draws an equivalence in the smooth setting. We also show that there is a time-like lower bound for the curvature of a spacetime.

## 3. Primordial Features in light of the Effective Field Theory of Large   Scale Structure

**Authors:** Rodrigo Calderon, Theo Simon, Arman Shafieloo, Dhiraj Kumar Hazra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06183v1)

**Summary:**

Inflationary models predict a power-law form of the primordial power spectrum (PPS) Various UV complete scenarios predict features on top of the standard power law that leave characteristic imprints in the late-time distribution of matter. We apply the EFTofLSS to galaxy power spectrum measurements from BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO to constrain specific global and local features in the PPS. We demonstrate that while such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low redshift.

## 4. Interface modes in inspiralling neutron stars: A gravitational-wave   probe of first-order phase transitions

**Authors:** A. R. Counsell, F. Gittins, N. Andersson, I. Tews

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06181v1)

**Summary:**

At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition. Such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events. We use relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory to make our findings. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 5. Gravitational Baryogenesis in Extended Proca-Nuevo Gravity

**Authors:** Abdul Malik Sultan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06133v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we investigate the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism in the framework of Extended Proca-Nuevo (EPN) gravity. This analysis is carried out for an early universe, encompassing three separate cosmological scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the baryon-to-entropy ratio is consistent with observational constraints in all scenarios. It highlights the potential of EPN gravity as a viable theory to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the early universe.

## 6. Black hole quasinormal mode resonances

**Authors:** Yiqiu Yang, Emanuele Berti, Nicola Franchini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06072v1)

**Summary:**

Black hole quasinormal mode frequencies can be very close to each other or even completely degenerate. We investigate this resonant behavior and demonstrate that near exceptional points, the two modes are just different covers of the same complex function on a Riemann surface. We also study the characteristic time domain signal due to the resonance in the frequency domain, illustrating the analogy between black hole signals at resonance and harmonic oscillators driven by a resonant external force. We find that quasinorm mode frequencies will not be accurately constrained unless we take into account the effect of resonances.

## 7. Cosmic inflation in non-perturbative quantum gravity

**Authors:** Alexey S. Koshelev, Abhishek Naskar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06035v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06035v1)

**Summary:**

String field theory motivated infinite-derivative models lead to non-local gravity modifications which form a promising class of quantum gravity candidates. In this paper we investigate effects of non-locality on the three-point function (the bi-spectrum) during cosmic inflation. The study is done in an Einstein frame with an infinite-Derivative scalar field Lagrangian minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert term. We find that $f_{NL}$ is non-trivially sensitive to the values of complex masses and this can reduce the parameter space of gravity modifications.

## 8. Torsion in two dimensions: autoparallels, symmetries, and applications   to black holes

**Authors:** Jens Boos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06013v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06013v1)

**Summary:**

We explore spacetime torsion in a two-dimensional setting. Without invoking field equations of a particular gravitational theory, we develop visualization techniques. We then utilize these structures to derive general properties of surface gravities of static black holes whose near-horizon region features approximately constant torsional fields. Under certain assumptions, the two- dimensional results can be lifted to four dimensions. The results can then be applied to black holes in three and four dimensions, as well as the universe as a whole.

## 9. Has ACT measured radiative corrections to the tree-level Higgs-like   inflation?

**Authors:** Ioannis D. Gialamas, Alexandros Karam, Antonio Racioppi, Martti Raidal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06002v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06002v1)

**Summary:**

Starobinsky inflation and non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation have been among the most favored models of the early universe. New results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope suggest a preference for higher values of $n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In this work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that incorporating one-loop corrections to a Higgs-like inflationary scenario leads to a shift in the predicted value.

## 10. Can gravity mediate the transmission of quantum information?

**Authors:** Andrea Mari, Stefano Zippilli, David Vitali

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05998v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an experiment to test the non-classicality of the gravitational interaction. We consider two optomechanical systems that are perfectly isolated, except for a weak gravitational coupling. If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must have a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any assumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum regime. We model gravity as a quadratic Hamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian thermal attenuator channel.

## 11. On the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to inflation beyond slow roll

**Authors:** Danilo Artigas, Emmanuel Frion, Tays Miranda, Vincent Vennin, David Wands

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05937v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05937v1)

**Summary:**

The Hamilton-Jacobi approach is a powerful tool to describe super-Hubble dynamics during cosmological inflation in a non-linear way. A key assumption of this framework is to neglect anisotropic perturbations on large scales. The approach cannot be used to describe the evolution of large-scale perturbation during inflation beyond slow roll, when non-adiabatic fluctuations play an important role due to the absence of an attractor trajectory, say the authors. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 12. Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics

**Authors:** Luca Buoninfante

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900v1)

**Summary:**

Strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. We show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory. This unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. It provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation.

## 13. Gravitational waves from primordial black hole dominance: The effect of   inflaton decay rate

**Authors:** Daniel del-Corral, K. Sravan Kumar, João Marto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon and could experience instabilities that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects.

## 14. Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch

**Authors:** Alexandar Ganz, Chunshan Lin, Mian Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase.

## 15. The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical   estimation

**Authors:** Albert Escrivà

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814v1)

**Summary:**

We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry. We find that the threshold for PBH formation does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in thetype-II region with the peak value of the critical compaction function $r_m$ being a minimum. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the types-I and type-II regions may have been overestimated.

## 16. A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature   fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism

**Authors:** Albert Escrivà

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable.

## 17. First law of de Sitter thermodynamics

**Authors:** G. E. Volovik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05763v1)

**Summary:**

The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature) On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosMological horizon. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches.

## 18. Rainbow gravity effects on Klein-Gordon particles in a quantized   nonuniform external magnetic field in the Bonnor-Melvin domain walls   background

**Authors:** Omar Mustafa, Abdullah Guvendi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05717v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the effect of rainbow gravity on Klein-Gordon (KG) bosons in a quantized nonuniform magnetic field in the background of Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime with a cosmological constant. In the process, we show that the BM spacetime introduces domain walls (i.e., infinitely impenetrable hard walls) at \(r = 0\) and \(\pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}\). As a result, the motion of KG particles/antiparticles is restricted indefinitely within the range.

## 19. On the evidence of a dark matter density spike around the primary black   hole in OJ 287

**Authors:** Debabrata Deb, Achamveedu Gopakumar, Mauri J. Valtonen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05715v1)

**Summary:**

The central engine of blazar OJ~287 is arguably the most notable supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate that emits nano-Hertz (nHz) gravitational waves. The use of post-Newtonian accurate SMBH binary orbital description that includes the effects of higher order GW emission turned out to be a crucial ingredient for accurately predicting the epochs of such Bremsstrahlung flares. It was very recently argued that one should include the effects. of dynamical friction, induced by certain dark matter density spikes around the primary SMB.H.

## 20. Thermodynamic supercriticality and complex phase diagram for the AdS   black hole

**Authors:** Zhen-Ming Xu, Robert B. Mann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05708v1)

**Summary:**

The Widom line of AdS black holes segregates the supercritical domain of the phase diagram into two disparate zones. As the system traverses the line, it undergoes a transition from one supercritical phase to another, while maintaining the continuity of its thermodynamic state functions. This behavior is fundamentally different from that below the critical point, where crossing the coexistence line results in discontinuities of thermodynamicState functions. The Widom Line enables a thermodynamic crossover between single-phase states without traversing the spinodal that emerges in the critical region.

## 21. Fractional Time-Delayed differential equations: Applications in   Cosmological Studies

**Authors:** Bayron Micolta-Riascos, Byron Droguett, Gisel Mattar Marriaga, Genly Leon, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Luis del Campo, Yoelsy Leyva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05705v1)

**Summary:**

Fractional differential equations model processes with memory effects, providing a realistic perspective on complex systems. We examine first-order and fractional Caputo time-delayed differential equations. We then solve this equation analytically. Due to the complexity of the analytical solution, we also provide a numerical representation. Our solution reaches the de Sitter equilibrium point. Additionally, we present some generalizations to Caputo's time-Delayed fractional differential equation. This equation accounts for the finite response times of cosmic fluids, resulting in a comprehensive model of the Universe's behavior.

## 22. Natural Theories

**Authors:** James Owen Weatherall, Eleanor March

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05703v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05703v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the class of physical theories whose dynamics are given by natural equations. Natural equations are partial differential equations determined by a functor. We show how the theory of natural equations clarifies several important foundational issues. We also state and prove a fundamental result about the initial value problem for natural equations, for some n.

## 23. On (Some) Gauge Theories of Gravity

**Authors:** James Owen Weatherall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05701v1)

**Summary:**

I consider the sense in which teleparallel gravity and symmetric telepar parallel gravity may be understood as gauge theories of gravity. I first argue that both theories have surplus structure. I then consider the relationship between Yang-Mills theory and Poincare Gauge Theory and argue that though these use similar formalisms, there are subtle disanalogies in their interpretation. Finally, I argue that even though both theories use the same formalisms there is a subtle difference in their interpretations.

## 24. Spacetime Models for Cosmology

**Authors:** James Owen Weatherall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05699v1)

**Summary:**

I revisit Roberto Torretti's "Spacetime Models for the World" [SHPMP 31 (2):171-186 (2000)] in the light of more recent work in (philosophy of) cosmology. I discuss the motivations for FLRW spacetimes as a natural starting point for inquiry. I then discuss the senses in which FLRW models are idealized, and I show how those idealizations (and partial de-idealizations) have contributed to our understanding of the universe.

## 25. Testing black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter environment using   quasinormal modes

**Authors:** Qun Tan, Dong Liu, Jie Liang, Zheng-Wen Long

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05641v1)

**Summary:**

This research explores the quasinormal modes (QNMs) characteristics of charged black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) environment. Based on the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the M87* black hole shadow, we implemented necessary constraints on the parameter space. The results reveal that: the magnetic charge $a$ and PFDM parameters $\lambda$ modulate the effective potential barrier of black hole spacetime, profoundly influencing the response frequency and energy dissipation characteristics of external perturbations.

## 26. Shadow radius and classical scattering analysis of two secondary hair   Horndeski black holes

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05602v1)

**Summary:**

We perform shadow radius analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole (CHB) and the naked singularity (NS) NS versions of CHB and bH arise from the charge extension of their photon spheres, while there is no NS version for MC. One branch (i) from the CHB is a point in the horizon realization but it shows up on the photon sphere and shadow radius. i-NS branch and NS play different roles from CHB, bH, and MC.

## 27. Conformal form-invariant parametrization of scalar-tensor gravity   theories: A critical analysis

**Authors:** Israel Quiros, Amit Kumar Rao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05572v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05572v1)

**Summary:**

We review the conformal form-invariant parametrization of scalar-tensor gravity theories. We also check the accuracy of the claim that the classical physical predictions of these theories are conformal-frame invariants. We investigate whether this parametrization is actually different from other existingParametrizations. We conclude with a review of the results on the action of matter fields in gravity theories and on the active and passive approaches to conformal transformations.
