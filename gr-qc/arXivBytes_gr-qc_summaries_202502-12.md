## 0. Killing and homothetic initial data for general hypersurfaces

**Authors:** Marc Mars, Gabriel Sánchez-Pérez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07767v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we present a collection of general identities relating the deformation tensor of an arbitrary vector field with the tensor on an abstract hypersurface. For spacelike hypersurfaces, we recover the well-known homothetic KID equations. We demonstrate that the equations can be formulated solely in terms of the initial data for the characteristic Cauchy problem, i.e. without involving a priori spacetime quantities. Other initial value problems, such as the spaceliked-characteristic with corners, can be approached similarly.

## 1. An Alternative Approach to the Exact Solution of FRW-Type Spacetime with   a Generalized Chaplygin Gas

**Authors:** D Panigrahi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07700v1)

**Summary:**

The generalized Chaplygin gas model is investigated within the framework of a Robertson-Walker spacetime. The resulting field equations governing this model are highly non-linear in the scale factor, forming the central focus of this work. A detailed analysis of the flip time has been conducted, providing both analytical and graphical insights. The present age of the universe has also been calculated and compared to the theoretical graph of $H(z)$ vs. $z$ A comparison of the results from both the theoretical and observational approaches reveals remarkable consistency.

## 2. The one-loop effective action from the coherent state path integral of   loop quantum gravity

**Authors:** Renata Ferrero, Muxin Han, Hongguang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07696v1)

**Summary:**

We adopt a novel approach to combine path integral methods with Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) Our approach builds upon the recently developed coherent state path integral formulation of LQG to compute the one-loop effective action. We compare this methodology with the conventional Quantum Field Theory (QFT) prescription for path integrals and extend the formalism to account for the dependence on boundary (coherent) states. We compute the effective action around flat spacetime obtaining analytical and numerical results in the long and short wavelength approximations, respectively.

## 3. Limits on the existence of totally reflective exotic compact objects   with current and future gravitational-wave detectors

**Authors:** Simone Mastrogiovanni, Elisa Maggio, Adriano Frattale Mascioli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07675v1)

**Summary:**

Exotic compact objects (ECOs) are a theorized class of compact objects that solve the paradoxes of black holes by replacing the event horizon with a physical surface. Spinning horizonless objects are prone to the ergoregion instability, which would prevent their existence if their spin is higher than a critical threshold. In this paper, we set upper limits on the existence of a population of merging ECOs from the spin distribution of the population of compact binary coalescences (CBCs) detected by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA.

## 4. Curved spacetimes from quantum mechanics

**Authors:** László B. Szabados

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07668v1)

**Summary:**

The ultimate extension of Penrose's Spin Geometry Theorem is given. It is shown how the geometry of any Lorentzian 4-manifold can be derived in the classical limit using only the observables in the algebraic formulation of abstract Poincar\'e-invariant elementary quantum mechanical systems. In particular, for any point $q$ of the classical spacetime manifold and curvature tensor there, there exists a composite system built from finitely many Poincare-e- Invariant systems.

## 5. Influences of accretion flow and dilaton charge on the images of   Einstein-Maxwell-dilation black hole

**Authors:** Gang Chen, Sen Guo, Jia-Shuo Li, Yu-Xiang Huang, Li-Fang Li, Peng Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07618v1)

**Summary:**

The characteristics and images of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) black holes are examined in this paper. We found that the shadow and photon sphere radii decrease with increasing dilaton charge. As the observation inclination increases, direct and secondary images become separate, with the direct image appearing hat-shaped. The study also shows that in thin disk accretion flows, the direct emission predominantly influences observed luminosity, with photon ring emission being less significant. Additionally, the appearance of black hole images varies with the observer's inclination angle.

## 6. Signatures of modified gravity from the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm   effect

**Authors:** Kimet Jusufi, Abdelrahman Yasser, Emmanuele Battista, Nader Inan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07613v1)

**Summary:**

To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector. It predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential. We determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the model.

## 7. Modified theories of gravity at different curvature scales

**Authors:** Susobhan Mandal, S. Shankaranarayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07437v1)

**Summary:**

General Relativity (GR) remains the cornerstone of gravitational physics. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum mechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark energy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes. This review provides an organized perspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the principles of GR they preserve or violate. The review also discusses the current and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including those probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and EEP.

## 8. Yukawa coupling, and inflationary correlation functions for a spectator   scalar via stochastic spectral expansion

**Authors:** Sourav Bhattacharya, Sudesh Kumar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07428v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a stochastic spectator scalar field coupled to fermion via the Yukawa interaction, in the inflationary de Sitter background. We find that the power spectrum and the spectral index corresponds to blue tilt with increasing $g$. The three point correlation function and non-Gaussianity corresponding to the density fluctuation has also been investigated. The increasing Yukawa coupling is shown to flatten the peak of the shape function in the squeezed limit. Also in this limit, the increase in the same is shows to increase the local non- Gaussianity parameter.

## 9. Scattered light reduction in Sagnac Speed Meters with Tunable Coherence

**Authors:** Leonie Eggers, Daniel Voigt, Oliver Gerberding

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07383v1)

**Summary:**

Sagnac Speed Meter and ring resonators can be used as high precision instruments, but they are limited in their sensitivity through scattered light causing non-linear noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a technique called Tunable Coherence, where the long coherence length of the laser is broken in a controlled way. We demonstrate a scattered light suppression of 24.2 dB in a Sagnac interferometer and discuss the experimental limitations. Further, we show an analytical discussion on how TunableCoherence could be a fundamental solution to light scattering back from optical surfaces into the counter propagating beam.

## 10. The Weinberg no-go theorem for cosmological constant and nonlocal   gravity

**Authors:** Salvatore Capozziello, Anupam Mazumdar, Giuseppe Meluccio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07321v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07321v1)

**Summary:**

Weinberg no-go theorem on cosmological constant. We show how a nonlocal gravitational interaction can circumvent it. In this perspective, one can describe the observed cosmic acceleration in terms of an effective field theory without relying on the fine-tuning of parameters or additional matter fields. In particular, Infinite Derivative Gravity theories hint at a possible understanding of the cosmologically constant as a non local gravitational effect on very large scales. We present our results in a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal.

## 11. Scalar Instabilities Inside The Extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole:   Novel Exact Solutions and Chronology Protection Conjecture

**Authors:** David Senjaya, Teephatai Bunyaratavej, Piyabut Burikham

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07267v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the stability of test scalar fields in the region inside the extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole (DKSBH) horizon, where closed timelike curves exist. We found that both massive and massless scalar quasiresonances are double branched, having purely positive and negative imaginary frequencies, therefore, do not propagate. This suggests no violation of Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC) However, only the positive branch with $0\leq\Omega_0<2(n+1)$ that grow exponentially has the ability to destroy spacetime. The QS zeroth modes flip sign between purely damping and purely growing when the scalar mass

## 12. Guiding interferometer improvements with the frequency-dependent   inspiral range

**Authors:** Derek Davis, Elenna Capote

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07253v1)

**Summary:**

There is no clear formalism for working with frequency-dependent inspiral range quantities. We introduce a metric for the cumulative normalized range of a gravitational-wave interferometer. We show how this metric is a valuable tool for guiding the commissioning of these interferometers. The metric provides increased clarity compared to other commonly used approaches. It is also a useful tool for comparing two separate noise curves. It can be used to compare the performance of ground-based gravitational- wave interferators.

## 13. Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Wormholes that meet the Energy Conditions

**Authors:** Leonel Bixano, Tonatiuh Matos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07206v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07206v1)

**Summary:**

One of the latest predictions of Einstein's theory is the existence of Wormholes (WH) In this work, we present exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations representing traversable Wormholes. These solutions satisfy the energy conditions and have a ring singularity satisfying the cosmic censorship of WHs, i.e. geodesics cannot touch the singularity. We find that the most optimal input regions for the first class of solutions traversing these wormholes are near the poles and near the equatorial plane for the second class.

## 14. Neutron star evolution by combining discontinuous Galerkin and finite   volume methods

**Authors:** Ananya Adhikari, Wolfgang Tichy, Liwei Ji, Amit Poudel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07204v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07204v1)

**Summary:**

A new hybrid scheme combines a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with finite volume (FV) and finite difference (FD) methods. The computational mesh is divided into smaller elements that touch but do not overlap. The goal is to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the more robust FV/FD method in elements that contain non-smooth shocks or star surfaces. We successfully evolve various single neutron star cases. These include the challenging cases of a neutron star in an unstable equilibrium migrating to a stable configuration.
