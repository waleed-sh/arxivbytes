**Authors:** Gautam Venugopalan, Clarke A. Hardy, Kenneth Kohn, Yuqi Zhu, Charles P. Blakemore, Alexander Fieguth, Jacqueline Huang, Chengjie Jia, Meimei Liu, Lorenzo Magrini, Nadav Priel, Zhengruilong Wang, Giorgio Gratta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13167v1)

**Summary:**

The search for new gravity-like interactions at the sub-millimeter scale is a compelling area of research. We report improved constraints on Yukawa-type interactions using optically levitated dielectric microspheres as test masses. The resulting upper limit on the strength of a hypothetical new force is $10^7$ at a Yukawa range. This result also advances our efforts to measure gravitational effects using micrometer-size objects, with important implications for embryonic ideas to investigate the quantum nature of gravity.

## 1. Redshift tomography of the kinematic matter dipole

**Authors:** Sebastian von Hausegger, Charles Dalang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13162v1)

**Summary:**

The dipole anisotropy induced by our peculiar motion in the sky distribution of cosmologically distant sources is an important consistency test of the standard FLRW cosmology. In this work, we formalize how to compute the kinematic matter dipole in redshift bins. We discuss examples and provide expressions to incorporate arbitrary redshift selection functions. Depending on the shape of a sample's redshift distribution and on the applied redshift cuts, the correction terms can become substantial, even to the degree that the direction of the dipole is reversed.

## 2. Effect of Type II Strong Gravitational Lensing on Tests of General   Relativity

**Authors:** Purnima Narayan, Nathan K. Johnson-McDaniel, Anuradha Gupta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13132v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13132v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BBH) coalescences provide a unique opportunity to test general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. To ensure the reliability of these tests, it is essential to identify and address potential sources of error, particularly those arising from missing physics in the waveform models used in GW data analysis. This paper investigates potential biases in these tests arising from strong gravitational lensing, an effect not currently incorporated into the standard framework for GR tests.

## 3. Asymptotically Conically Minkowskian spacetimes from self-gravitating   dust

**Authors:** Matteo Fontana, Federico Scali, Sergio Luigi Cacciatori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13048v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13048v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein equations describe stationary and axisymmetric configurations of self-gravitating dust. A distinctive feature of these solutions is the potential presence of conical singularities along the rotation axis. Such singularities can be removed by imposing suitable boundary conditions along the axis. Asymptotically far away from it the geometry becomes locally flat, in the sense that the Riemann tensor vanishes, but globally, instead of reducing to Minkowski space, it takes the form of a cone.

## 4. Comparative analysis of the NANOgrav Hellings-Downs as a window into new   physics

**Authors:** Rubén Arjona, Savvas Nesseris, Sachiko Kuroyanagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12975v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12975v1)

**Summary:**

Pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have recently provided strong evidence for the signal of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz-frequency band. These experiments have shown a statistical preference for the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation between pulsars. Using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of four different models that go beyond the standard cosmological framework. We find that the spin-2 ultralight DM and the massive gravity model are statistically equivalent to the HD prediction, and there is weak evidence in favor of the non-Gaussian component.

## 5. Baryogenesis from Primordial CP Violation

**Authors:** Venus Keus, Edward W. Kolb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12957v1)

**Summary:**

Baryogenesis is a new type of quantum theory. Baryons are created by an asymmetry of scalars in a three-Higgs doublet model. This asymmetry is translated into baryons through electroweak instantons. The mechanism is described in the book Baryogenesis: A New Theory of Baryonogenesis. The book is published by Oxford University Press and is available on Amazon.com for £8.99.

## 6. Quantum theory of the Lemaitre model for gravitational collapse

**Authors:** Claus Kiefer, Hamid Mohaddes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12947v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the quantum fate of the classical singularities that occur by gravitational collapse of a dust cloud. We find that the singularities can generically be avoided. This is a consequence of unitary evolution in the quantum theory, whereby the quantum dust cloud collapses, bounces at a minimal radius and re-expands. We address the quantization of a model first proposed by Georges Lemaitre in 1933, and find that it can be used to predict the quantum state of a cloud.

## 7. Bifurcation in a bouncing universe

**Authors:** M. Novello, A. G. Cesar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12901v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12901v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the presence of a bifurcation in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic bouncing universe generated by viscous processes. The analysis of the phase diagrams of the dynamics of General Relativity show the presence of bifurcations on the model and particularly on bouncing equilibrium points. We conclude that the universe is not homogeneous, but is a bouncing universe with a viscous and homogeneous component. We also conclude that there are no bifurlations in the universe.

## 8. Scaterring of Massless Quasiparticles in the 3He-A Superfluid

**Authors:** Alexandre M. de M. Carvalho, Alisson S. Marques, Glauber T. Silva, Gabriel Q. Garcia, Claudio Furtado

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12872v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12872v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we analyze the scattering of fermionic quasiparticles in the presence of radial disgyrations and symmetric vortices in the superfluid 3He-A. We consider a Volovik analog model for the description of these defects. We solve the massless Dirac equation employing this methodology to gain comprehensive insights into the scattering phenomena and its dependence on the geometric properties. These results validate the optical theorem and highlight the role of defect topology in the scattering process.

## 9. Third post-Newtonian dynamics for eccentric orbits and aligned spins in   the effective-one-body waveform model SEOBNRv5EHM

**Authors:** Aldo Gamboa, Mohammed Khalil, Alessandra Buonanno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12831v1)

**Summary:**

The effective-one-body (EOB) formalism combines various analytical approximation methods with information derived from numerical-relativity simulations. We obtain EOB results for eccentric orbits that are accurate up to the third post-Newtonian order for the complete far-zone energy and angular-momentum fluxes. We employ these findings to build the inspiral part of the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, which includes the 3PN eccentricity contributions in the RR force and waveform modes using the Keplerian parametrization.

## 10. Accurate waveforms for eccentric, aligned-spin binary black holes: The   multipolar effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM

**Authors:** Aldo Gamboa, Alessandra Buonanno, Raffi Enficiaud, Mohammed Khalil, Antoni Ramos-Buades, Lorenzo Pompili, Héctor Estellés, Michael Boyle, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Hannes R. Rüter, Mark A. Scheel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12823v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12823v1)

**Summary:**

Upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs are expected to detect a subpopulation of eccentric signals. ignoring eccentricity in waveform models could introduce significant biases in parameter estimation and tests of General Relativity. We develop a new time-domain, effective-one-body, multipolar waveform model for eccentric binary black holes with spins aligned (or antialigned) with the orbital angular momentum. We validate the model's accuracy by computing its unfaithfulness against 99 (28 public and 71 private) eccentric numerical-relativity simulations.

## 11. The long-short GRB connection

**Authors:** J. A. Rueda, L. Becerra, C. L. Bianco, M. Della Valle, C. L. Fryer, C. Guidorzi, R. Ruffini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12764v1)

**Summary:**

Long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to arise from different astrophysical progenitors. Long GRBs have been thought to result from the collapse of single massive stars, while short GRBs come from mergers of compact object binaries. We demonstrate that the observational properties of long GRBs are naturally explained within the framework of the binary-driven hypernova model. This suggests an evolutionary connection between long and shortGRBs. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 12. Can quasars, triggered by mergers, account for NANOGrav's stochastic   gravitational wave background?

**Authors:** Ágnes Kis-Tóth, Zoltán Haiman, Zsolt Frei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12726v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12726v1)

**Summary:**

Stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) recently discovered by several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments is consistent with arising from a population of coalescing super-massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) The amplitude of the background is somewhat higher than expected in most previous population models or from the local mass density of SMBHs. SMBHBs are expected to be produced in galaxy mergers, which are also thought to trigger bright quasar activity. We find a GWB amplitude approximately matching the value measured by NANOGrav.

## 13. Existence of photon region for stationary axisymmetric black holes

**Authors:** Prasad Padhye, Kajol Paithankar, Sanved Kolekar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12665v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12665v1)

**Summary:**

The black hole shadow is fundamentally connected to the structure of light rings and photon region in the background geometry. We investigate spherical photon orbits (SPOs) and photon regions in generic asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric black hole spacetimes. We formally define the photon region's boundary purely in terms of the background metric functions, independent of the photon's parameters like energy or angular momentum. We further analyze its common features including overlap with the ergoregion and rotation sense of SPOs.

## 14. Inflation and primordial fluctuations in $f(Q,T)$ gravity

**Authors:** Parviz Goodarzi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12618v1)

**Summary:**

We study slow roll inflation and the generation of primordial density fluctuations within the context of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. By imposing constraints on the parameters of the model, we achieve results that align well with the Planck 2018 data. Interestingly, a model including a $T^2$ dependence showed good agreement with the observational data. We calculate the power spectrum and spectral index for scalar and tensor modes within the $f('Q'', 'T') model.

## 15. Gravitational Atoms and Black Hole Binaries

**Authors:** Giovanni Maria Tomaselli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12526v1)

**Summary:**

Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new ultralight bosons. This thesis investigates a way to discover such particles through observations of gravitational waves from binary black holes. This is possible through black hole superradiance, which spontaneously creates a "boson cloud" around a rapidly spinning black hole. The predictions can be tested with current and future interferometers, such as LISA, LIGO, DECIGO and TianQin. The most distinctive observational signatures of the cloud are the orbital energy lost through ionization.
