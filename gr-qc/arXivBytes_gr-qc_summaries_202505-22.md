## 0. CMB Lensing Trispectrum as a Probe of Parity Violation in LSS

**Authors:** Alessandro Greco, Zachary Slepian, Jiamin Hou, Alex Krolewski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15789v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15789v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing trispectrum is sensitive to parity violation in Large-Scale Structure (LSS) We obtain a compact expression for the reduced lenser that is general for any input matter. This work serves as a proof of principle, demonstrating how future studies of more physically motivated models can be conducted. It also provides an intuitive physical explanation of why CMB lensing issensitive to parity. Our work is the first to point out that secondary CMB anisotropies can be used to probe parity in LSS.

## 1. Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light   model through the cosmic distance duality relation

**Authors:** Jaiane Santos, Carlos Bengaly, Rodrigo S. Gonçalves

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15768v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15768v1)

**Summary:**

In the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance and the angular diameter distance is expected to deviate from the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) We test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together. However, when SNe and 2DBAO only are considered, the standardCDDR is only recovered at $sim 4\s Sigma$ level.

## 2. Detector Based Evaluation of Extractable Entanglement in Flat spacetime

**Authors:** Hiromasa Tajima, Riku Yoshimoto, Ryo Nemoto, Yuki Osawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15716v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15716v1)

**Summary:**

Entanglement entropy (EE) is widely used to quantify quantum correlations in field theory. It remains unclear how much of the entanglement is physically extractable via local measurements. This work provides an operational perspective on field-theoretic Entanglement. It sets fundamental limits on its extractability and provides a new perspective on quantum field theory in the 21st century. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal (ASJ) (http://www. astrophysicaljournal.com/ASJ/2013/01/21/astrophysics-journal.html)

## 3. Some exact results on the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario

**Authors:** Piotr P. Goldstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15541v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15541v1)

**Summary:**

Bielinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario for the universe near the cosmological singularity is supplemented with a few exact results following from the BKL asymptotic. The universe undergoes oscillations of Kasner type, which reduce the length scales to nearly zero in some directions, while largely extending it in the others. Reduced equations are proposed and explicitly solved to describe these oscillations near their turning points. In logarithmic variables, the oscillations are found to have sawtooth shapes.

## 4. Quasinormal Modes of Schwarzschild Black Holes in the Dehnen-(1, 4, 5/2)   Type Dark Matter Halos

**Authors:** Qi-Qi Liang, Dong Liu, Zheng-Wen Long

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15540v1)

**Summary:**

Researchers have speculated that black holes may exist in this dark matter model and have given the black hole metric solutions. The larger the values of the dark matter halo parameter values, the smaller the peak value of the effective potential, and the wave function oscillation slows down with a lower frequency. The black hole remains stable under perturbations. These studies provide relevant data for the quasinormal modes of the Schwarzschild black hole in the Dehnen-(1,4, 5/2) type dark Matter halo.

## 5. A fast deep-learning approach to probing primordial black hole   populations in gravitational wave events

**Authors:** Jun-Qian Jiang, Hai-Long Huang, Jibin He, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15530v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBHs) may contribute to the part of the gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. Traditional Bayesian analysis relies on precise GW-event posterior estimates. We present a fast deep-learning framework, leveraging Transformer and normalizing flows, that maps GW- event posterior samples to joint posterior distributions over the PBH population. Our approach yields accurate credible intervals while reducing end-to-end inference time to $O(1)$ s on a single GPU.

## 6. Constraining scalar-tensor theories from higher harmonics with GW230529

**Authors:** Baoxiang Wang, Tao Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15448v1)

**Summary:**

The Advanced LIGO and Virgo collaborations recently detected a gravitational wave event. This observation provides an opportunity to test a class of gravitational theories that deviate from general relativity. In such theories, additional terms contribute to the gravitational wave signal only in cases of asymmetric binaries. These models have potential applications in areas such as dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation, and primordial nucleosynthesis. The study focuses on two scalar-tensor models: the Screened Modified Gravity and Brans-Dicke theory.

## 7. Impact of general relativistic accretion on primordial black holes

**Authors:** Santabrata Das, Md Riajul Haque, Jitumani Kalita, Rajesh Karmakar, Debaprasad Maity

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15419v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe. PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology. We show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporship, potentially within the reach of future detectors.

## 8. A Falsifiable Alternative to General Relativity

**Authors:** Daniel Coumbe, Aria Rahmaty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15399v1)

**Summary:**

Asymptotically Weyl-invariant gravity (AWIG) is a power-counting renormalizable alternative to general relativity (GR) An expression for the dimensionless exponent n(R) is derived based on dynamical dimensional reduction. We show that this version of AWIG naturally resolves several theoretical issues normally associated with the Palatini formalism. A falsifiable prediction regarding the frequency of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is made. A preliminary analysis of gravitational wave GW150914 yields a maximum tension of 0.9° with GR and marginally favours AWIG.

## 9. A note on the calculation of the Komar integral in the Lorentzian   Taub-NUT spacetime

**Authors:** Gabriele Barbagallo, José Luis V. Cerdeira, Carmen Gómez-Fayrén, Tomás Ortín

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15349v1)

**Summary:**

We show how the same results are obtained when the Mister-string singularities are removed by using Misner's procedure. Different choices of hypersurfaces may contain different strings and lead to different physics, though. We show how, even though the complete spacetime has no such singularities anymore, they are unavoidable in all spacelike hypersurfaced which are used in the Komar integrals. We also show how to remove the singularities from the Lorentzian Taub--NUT spacetime.

## 10. A Deep Dive into classical and Topological CFT Thermodynamics in   Lifshitz and Hyperscaling Violating Black Holes

**Authors:** Mohammad Ali S. Afshar, Mohammad Reza Alipour, Saeed Noori Gashti, Jafar Sadeghi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15314v1)

**Summary:**

Holographic dictionary for Lifshitz black holes and hyperscaling violation (HSV) models has provided an essential foundation for studying CFT thermodynamics and phase behavior of these black holes. Based on this framework, we will investigate their thermodynamic properties using two distinct approaches. In the first step, we adopt the classical and traditional method, examining the behavior of the free energy function as a function of temperature near the critical boundary. By analyzing its behavior, we then proceed to evaluate the stability of the models. We will analyze phase behavior through the lens of topological charges.

## 11. Canonical Structure and Hidden Symmetries in Scalar Field Cosmology

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15207v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. We construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of transformations can relate the solution spaces of different models, such as of the scalarField and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.

## 12. Stability Analysis of the Possible Consistent Model of Parity Violations   in the Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity: Generalized Background Solutions

**Authors:** Yeheng Tong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15169v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15169v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we consider a symmetric teleparallel gravity model that extends the general relativity equivalent model. We derive three different families of background solutions in flat FRW universe, with three classes of different connections. Through investigations on the linear cosmological perturbations, we show that one of the vector modes of this model will evolve into a ghost field at high energy. The ghost instability can be cancelled only under specific combinations of the coefficients. On two of three families of backgrounds, such combination remains the same as the one we have investigated in our previous work.

## 13. Quasinormal Modes from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations in Vector-Tensor   Gravity

**Authors:** Shogo Tomizuka, Hajime Kobayashi, Naritaka Oshita, Kazufumi Takahashi, Shinji Mukohyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15125v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric black hole background with a timelike vector field. We derive the quadratic Lagrangian written in terms of two master variables, corresponding to the tensor and vector gravitons. The ringdown gravitational waves may exhibit characteristic modulation that can in principle be a signature of vector-tensor gravity. We find that the quasinormal mode frequencies for both degrees of freedom are obtained from those in general relativity by simple scaling.

## 14. Dynamical model for black hole to white hole transitions

**Authors:** Samantha Hergott, Viqar Husain, Saeed Rastgoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15096v1)

**Summary:**

We present an asymptotically flat spherically symmetric non-singular metric. It describes gravitational collapse and matter bounce with transient black hole and white hole regions. The metric provides a dynamical counterpart to proposed static non- Singular black holes. It is also a phenomenological model for possible black hole to white hole transitions in quantum gravity. We present it here as a model for black hole-to-white hole transitions. We hope it will be useful in the development of new theories of gravity.

## 15. Imprints of Large-Scale Structures in the Anisotropies of the   Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background

**Authors:** Rafael Bravo, Walter Riquelme

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15084v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the cross-correlation between the anisotropies of the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) and the galaxy density contrast. We find that the signal under certain conditions could be distinguishable from noise. Our results imply that a cross-Correlation between GW anisotropic and LSS can indeed come from a stochastic background ofcosmological origin and could be used to distinguish it from an astrophysical one. In addition, by considering a CGWB sourced by scalar-induced gravitational waves, and the inclusion of a scale-dependent galaxy bias, we use theCrossCorrelation to forecast local primordial non-Gaussianity.

## 16. Shapes and orientations of massive halos in the statistically   anisotropic universe

**Authors:** Shogo Masaki, Yurino Mizuguchi, Shohei Saga, Shuichiro Yokoyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15082v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate how statistical anisotropy (SA) in matter distributions affects the shapes and orientations of cluster-sized halos. We find that halo orientations are significantly influenced, with halos tending to align either perpendicular or parallel to the SA direction. This SA-induced alignment becomes more prominent for more massive halos, we say. Our findings suggest that observational measurements of projected halo shapes, such as those derived from galaxy cluster-galaxy lensing, could provide a novel probe of SA in the universe.
