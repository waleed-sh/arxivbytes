## 0. Primordial Sharp Features through the Nonlinear Regime of Structure   Formation

**Authors:** Cl√©ment Stahl, Denis Werth, Vivian Poulin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02571v1)

**Summary:**

Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation give rise to sharp features in the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a unique window into the physics of inflation. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial features would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they are expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated N-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while oscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of primordial sharp features can persist.

## 1. Black Hole Thermodynamics via Tsallis Statistical Mechanics

**Authors:** Phuwadon Chunaksorn, Ratchaphat Nakarachinda, Pitayuth Wongjun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02522v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02522v1)

**Summary:**

An investigation of black hole thermodynamics based on Tsallis statistical mechanics is explored through the study of the thermodynamics of a gas system located near the horizon of a black hole. Since the entropy of the black hole is proportional to the horizon area, it is more suitable to use non-extensive statistical mechanics instead of the usual Gibbs-Boltzmann ones. It is found that the black Hole entropy gets a modification due to non- Extensivity. By using such an entropy, the blackhole can be stabilized due to theNon-extensivity, and the bound on the non-Extensive parameter is also determined.

## 2. Gravitational Vacuum Condensate Stars in the Effective Theory of Gravity

**Authors:** Emil Mottola

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02519v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02519v1)

**Summary:**

The low energy effective theory of gravity comprises two elements of quantum theory joined to classical general relativity. The first is the quantum conformal anomaly, which is responsible for macroscopic correlations on light cones and a stress tensor that can strongly modify the classical geometry at black hole horizons. The second is the formulation of vacuum energy in terms of an exact $4$-form abelian gauge field strength $F\!=\!dA$. The Schwarzschild black hole horizon is thereby replaced by a surface, with a positive surface tension and worldtube topology, separating regions of differing vacuum energy.

## 3. Minimal covariant quantum space-time

**Authors:** Alessandro Manta, Harold C. Steinacker

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02498v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss minimal covariant quantum space-time. We find an over-complete set of (quasi-) coherent states, with a large hierarchy between the uncertainty scale and the geometric curvature scale. This provides an interesting background for the IKKT model, leading to a $\mathfrak{hs}$-extended gravitational gauge theory, which is free of ghosts due to the constraints on phase space arising from the doubleton representation. In particular we find a set of $S^2$-bundle over a 3+1-dimensional $k=-1$ FLRW space- time.

## 4. Constraints on minimally and conformally coupled ultralight dark matter   with the EPTA

**Authors:** Clemente Smarra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02420v1)

**Summary:**

Pulsar Timing Array experiments, tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods, can shed light on the presence of ultralight particles in our Galaxy. Millisecond pulsars are extremely stable natural timekeepers. The discussion presented here is based on the [1,2] and [3] papers presented in the [4,5] conference paper. The authors conclude that the constraints on the universal scalar coupling of the field to Standard Model particles improve on existing bounds by several orders of magnitude in the relevant mass range.

## 5. A Compact theorem on the compactness of ultra-compact objects with   monotonically decreasing matter fields

**Authors:** Shahar Hod

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02375v1)

**Summary:**

Self-gravitating horizonless ultra-compact objects that possess light rings have attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians in recent years. In the present compact paper we raise the following physically interesting question: Is there a lower bound on the global compactness parameters of these objects? Using the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations we explicitly prove that spatially regular ultra-Compact objects with monotonically decreasing density functions are characterized by the lower bound of their dimensionless compactness.

## 6. Elucidating the Dark Energy and Dark Matter Phenomena Within the   Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) Paradigm

**Authors:** Vesselin G. Gueorguiev, Andre Maeder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02282v1)

**Summary:**

The enigmatic phenomenon of dark energy (DE) is regarded as the elusive entity driving the accelerated expansion of our Universe. A plausible candidate for DE is the non-zero Einstein Cosmological Constant, yet it seemingly defies gravitational effects. We revisit the conformal scale factor and its defining equations within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm. We address the profound problem of the missing mass across galactic and extragalactic scales by deriving an MOND-like relation.

## 7. Bounce solutions with quantum vacuum effects of massive fields and   subsequent Starobinsky inflation

**Authors:** Wagno Cesar e Silva, Samuel W. P. Oliveira, Ilya L. Shapiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02281v1)

**Summary:**

We extend the previous work about the cosmological solutions with bounce without modifications of gravity or introducing an extra scalar field. The main finding was that the bounce is possible in the initially contracting Universe filled with matter. After a strong contraction, matter gains the equation of state close to the one of radiation, such that the effect on matter on the evolution of the FLRW metric disappears. However, this effect comes back owing to the quantum trace anomaly in the matter/radiation sector. We explore the weak impact of massive fields on the anomaly-driven bounce solution.

## 8. Constructing regular black holes from multi-polytropic equations of   state

**Authors:** Seyed Naseh Sajadi, Supakchai Ponglertsakul, Orlando Luongo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02098v1)

**Summary:**

Regular black holes are imagined as solutions to Einstein's field equations, with no singularities, albeit characterized by the presence of an internal structure. We propose to obtain new classes of solutions that can also satisfy the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, plus adding a non-zero core. Our analysis demonstrates that, within specific parameter ranges, repulsive gravity effects may occur in precise regions. We explore the interpretation of these regular black hole solutions in terms of topological thermodynamic defects.

## 9. Self-consistent scenario for jet and stellar explosion in collapsar:   General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with dynamo

**Authors:** Masaru Shibata, Sho Fujibayashi, Shinya Wanajo, Kunihito Ioka, Alan Tsz-Lok Lam, Yuichiro Sekiguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02077v1)

**Summary:**

A resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation with a dynamo term is performed for modeling the collapsar in full general relativity. After the growth of a massive torus around the black hole, the magnetic field is amplified in it, developing poloidal fields via dynamo. In the presence of jet launching, $r$-process elements are weakly synthesized. Together with the jet launch, the effectively viscous effect in the inner region of the torus and the magnetocentrifugal effect drive the stellar explosion.

## 10. Impact of Higher-order Tidal Corrections on the Measurement Accuracy of   Neutron Star Tidal Deformability

**Authors:** Gyeongbin Park, Chang-Hwan Lee, Hee-Suk Cho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02043v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron stars provide information about the internal structure of neutron stars. We investigate how the measurement accuracy of NS's tidal deformability can be improved by incorporating the higher-order post-Newtonian (pN) tidal corrections up to 7.5 pN. We find that the effect of tidal corrections shows no behavior of convergence with increasing pN orders. We use a semi-analytic method, Fisher Matrix, which is much faster than performing parameter estimation simulations.

## 11. From Matter Density to Deflection Angle and Gravitational Lensing Using   Perturbative Method

**Authors:** Peiran Liu, Xiaotian Zhang, Junji Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02037v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we develop a perturbative method to compute the deflection angle of null or timelike signals in spacetimes filled with a static and spherically symmetric (SSS) perfect fluid. Gravitational lensing equations are also solved perturbatively to derive the apparent angles of the lensed images. We apply these methods and results to the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White model and some other density profiles to analyze the influence of the density parameters.
