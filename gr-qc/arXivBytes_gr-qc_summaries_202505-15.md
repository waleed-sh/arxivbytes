## 0. Accelerating the time-domain LISA response model with central finite   differences and hybridization techniques

**Authors:** Jorge Valencia, Sascha Husa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09600v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09600v1)

**Summary:**

Accurate and efficient modeling of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) response is crucial for gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis. Without approximations, the full LISA response is computationally expensive. Traditional approaches, such as the long-wavelength approximation, accelerate the response calculation at the cost of reducing accuracy at high frequencies. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid time-domain response for LISA that balances computational efficiency and accuracy across the binary's evolution.

## 1. Constraining Superluminal Einstein-Æther Gravity through   Gravitational Memory

**Authors:** Lavinia Heisenberg, Benedetta Rosatello, Guangzi Xu, Jann Zosso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09544v1)

**Summary:**

Every emission of radiation in gravity also includes a non-wave-like component that leaves a permanent change in proper distances of the spacetime it travels through. This phenomenon is known as gravitational displacement memory. We find that an emission of scalar and vector aether waves at a propagation speed greater than the speed of tensor radiation features unprotected causal directions with a priori unbound memory build-up. Based on the results, we conjecture a stringent exclusion of the superluminal parameter space of Einstein-Aether gravity.

## 2. The construction and use of dephasing prescriptions for environmental   effects in gravitational wave astronomy

**Authors:** János Takátsy, Lorenz Zwick, Kai Hendriks, Pankaj Saini, Gaia Fabj, Johan Samsing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09513v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09513v1)

**Summary:**

This work synthesizes insights from two decades of literature. It can serve both as a reference for researchers in the field as well as a modern introduction for those who wish to enter it. In the second part, we derive novel aspects of dephasing for eccentric GW sources and lay the foundations for consistently treating the full problem. Our results highlight the unique potential of modelling and searching for EE in eccentric binary sources of GWs. We focus in particular on the relationship between orbital perturbations in the time-domain and the resulting dephased in both time and frequency domain.

## 3. Precision Joint Constraints on Cosmology and Gravity Using Strongly   Lensed Gravitational Wave Populations

**Authors:** Xinguang Ying, Tao Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09507v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09507v1)

**Summary:**

We present a unified Bayesian framework to jointly constrain the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$, a key probe of deviations from general relativity. We exploit the population characteristics of strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) events from binary black hole mergers. We demonstrate that this method can achieve precision levels of $0.4\% - 0.7\%$ for$ H_0 $ at $68\% $ credibility, significantly outperforming existing joint constraints.

## 4. When Dark Matter Heats Up: A Model-Independent Search for Non-Cold   Behavior

**Authors:** Mazaharul Abedin, Luis A. Escamilla, Supriya Pan, Eleonora Di Valentino, Weiqiang Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09470v1)

**Summary:**

This article questions the common assumption of cold dark matter (DM) by exploring the possibility of a non-zero equation of state (EoS) In standard cosmological analyses, DM is typically modeled as pressureless dust with $w_{\rm DM} = 0. We explore this possibility through non-parametric and model-independent reconstructions based on Gaussian Process Regression. Our findings suggest that a dynamical EoS for DM, although statistically mild, cannot be conclusively ruled out.

## 5. Evaluating statistical significance for massive black hole binary   mergers with space-based gravitational wave detectors

**Authors:** Hong-Yu Chen, En-Kun Li, Yi-Ming Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09446v1)

**Summary:**

In the 2030s, multiple space-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to operate. In Gaussian noise conditions, MBHBs with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 7 can achieve $3 \sigma$ significance, and those with a Signal-To-Noise Ratio of about 8 achieve $4\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that all MBHB signals in the LDC-2a dataset have a significance exceeding $4.62 \s Sigma$. We also analyze factors affecting the significance of MB HBs and design a method to mitigate multi-source confusion interference.

## 6. Simulating jet launching in binary neutron star mergers with no   artificial atmosphere limitations

**Authors:** Jay V. Kalinani, Riccardo Ciolfi, Manuela Campanelli, Bruno Giacomazzo, Andrea Pavan, Allen Wen, Yosef Zlochower

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09426v1)

**Summary:**

In models forming an accreting black hole (BH) 25 ms after merger, incipient jets are launched with terminal Lorentz factors and Poynting-flux luminosities compatible with GRBs. The rather high jet velocities reached in a few tens of ms, when compared to previous simulations adopting a much higher density floor, show the importance of removing any influence of the latter. In absence of collapse, we find the emergence of much heavier and slower polar outflows, incapable of producing a GRB.

## 7. Quantum signatures in black hole accretion: Pair production in dynamical   magnetic fields

**Authors:** Susobhan Mandal, Tausif Parvez, S. Shankaranarayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09355v1)

**Summary:**

Accretion disks around black holes host extreme conditions where general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics dominate. These disks exhibit two distinct dynamical regimes -- Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) and Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) In the MAD regime, these systems exhibit magnetic fields up to $10^8$ G and variability on gravitational timescales. Here, we employ quantum field theory in background gauge fields to demonstrate that the dynamic magnetic fields of MADs drive significant pair production via the Schwinger mechanism.

## 8. The Dual Primordial Black Hole Formation Scenario

**Authors:** Xinpeng Wang, Misao Sasaki, Ying-li Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09337v1)

**Summary:**

Two families of primordial black holes may form at nearly the same comoving scales but at two different epochs. It is realized in two-stage inflation where a non-inflationary stage is sandwiched by the two inflationary stages. This mechanism may realize both reheating of the universe through the evaporation of ultralight PBHs formed during the break stage and dark matter by those formed after inflation. We show that this scenario may give rise to a distinctive signature in the stochastic gravitational wave background that can be tested by the near-future gravitational wave observatories.

## 9. Near-horizon behavior of nonequatorial accelerated particle motion and   high energy particle collisions

**Authors:** H. V. Ovcharenko, O. B. Zaslavskii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09330v1)

**Summary:**

We consider motion of a particle in the background of a stationary axially symmetric generic black hole. A particle experiences the action of a force of unspecified nature. We require the force to remain finite in a comoving frame. We show that the polar component of the four-velocity remains finite. As a result, the scenarios of high-energy particle collisions, found previously in the context of the BSW effect for equatorial motion, do not change qualitatively in the nonequatorial case.

## 10. Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Constraints from the generalized   parton distributions (GPDs)

**Authors:** The MMGPDs Collaboration, Muhammad Goharipour, Anoushiravan Moradi, K. Azizi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291v1)

**Summary:**

The Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of gravity modifies general relativity in high-density regimes. It offers an alternative framework that avoids cosmological singularities and remodels gravitational dynamics within compact objects. An important feature of EiBI gravity is its additional parameter, $\kappa$, which governs deviations from standard gravitational behavior. In this study, we investigate constraints on $kappa$ using the internal pressure distribution of the proton, derived from gravitational form factor (GFF)

## 11. Probing Self-Interacting Dark Matter via Gravitational-Wave Background   from Eccentric Supermassive Black Hole Mergers

**Authors:** Mu-Chun Chen, Yong Tang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09219v1)

**Summary:**

Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries. Current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDm with a value comparable to other astrophysical probes. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.

## 12. Exotic Encounters: Buchdahl's Conditions and Physical Black Holes

**Authors:** Ioannis Soranidis, Daniel R. Terno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09189v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09189v1)

**Summary:**

Physical black holes are light-trapping regions that form in finite time as seen by a distant observer. We show that these configurations necessarily violate at least two of Buchdahl's four original conditions, and the post-formation state violates them all. These violations are substantial: they include the null energy condition, non-monotonic energy profiles, and strong pressure anisotropies. Thus, the requirement of truly forming a horizon places physical black holes in a class of solutions that are more exotic than exotic compact objects.

## 13. The Possibility of Formation of Compact Boson Stars via Cosmological   Evolution of a Background Scalar Field

**Authors:** Yu Miyauchi, Takahiro Tanaka

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09159v1)

**Summary:**

Boson stars are hypothetical astrophysical objects bound by the self-gravity of a scalar field. The formation scenario of compact boson stars within the age of the universe remains unclear. The required initial states are not the configurations that can be described by the well-studied Schrodinger-Poisson system, the authors say. However, they argue that the formation of a boson star cannot be achieved in a single filed model as it requires two coupled scalar fields and a spatially homogeneous background field.

## 14. Magnetized Letelier black hole in AdS spacetime

**Authors:** Ahmad Al-Badawi, Faizuddin Ahmed, İzzet Sakallı, Sanjar Shaymatov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156v1)

**Summary:**

The study looked at the motion of charged, neutral, and light-like particles in a magnetized black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background. We demonstrate that key parameters characterizing the geometry-such as the cloud ofstrings parameter, the magnetic field strength, and the AdS radius-significantly affect the trajectories of these particles. These findings provide potential observables for distinguishing between different black hole models in realistic astrophysical environments.

## 15. Manifestly Covariant Canonical Formalism of Quadratic Gravity

**Authors:** Ichiro Oda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09149v1)

**Summary:**

We present the manifestly covariant quantization of quadratic gravity or higher-derivative gravity in the de Donder gauge condition. We explicitly calculate various equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs) and show that they are identically vanishing. We also clarify global symmetries, the physical content of quadRatic gravity, and clearly show that this theory is not unitary and has a massive scalar, massive ghost and massless graviton as physical modes. Finally, we comment on confinement of the massive ghost, thereby recovering the unitarity of the physical S-matrix.

## 16. Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity   violation

**Authors:** Indranil Chakraborty, Susmita Jana, S. Shankaranarayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity. It can also be used to amplify polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity.

## 17. Entropy in Loop Quantum Cosmology

**Authors:** Alejandro Corichi, Omar Gallegos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09055v1)

**Summary:**

The Generalized First Law (GFL) and the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics are searched for effective and alternative cosmic models. The general conditions of the GSL validity are analyzed for the entropy as a general function and for logarithmic corrections to the usual Black Hole entropy. In addition, we explore the possibility of having negative temperature, where the validity conditions for an alternative generalized second law (AGSL) are studied. We study the regions where the GFL is valid for an effective Loop Quantum Cosmology model with spatially flat curvature.

## 18. Dictionary revision for mapping boundary data to bound states

**Authors:** Jiliang Jing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09052v1)

**Summary:**

The correspondence between gravitational observables derived from scattering processes and adiabatic invariants in bound orbits has garnered significant attention in the study of bound orbital systems. The existing dictionary for this correspondence produces complex-valued quantities of bound orbits that contravene physical principles in 4PM calculations. We propose a rigorous modification by employing Hawking's method for black hole radiation. We also evaluate the new dictionary by comparing the binding energy calculated using effective one-body (EOB) theory with numerical relativity (NR) simulations data.

## 19. Extreme Compactness, Extreme Gravity: Higher-Derivative Corrections to   ECOs

**Authors:** Madhur Mehta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09049v1)

**Summary:**

Higher-derivative gravity theories offer insights into the behavior of extremely compact objects (ECOs) We focus on Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss- Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. We demonstrate how higher-curvature corrections lead to deviations from the standard ECO compactness scale. Observational constraints suggest these effects could be significant in certain astrophysical systems, providing a new perspective on the nature ofextremely compact objects in models of modified gravity.
