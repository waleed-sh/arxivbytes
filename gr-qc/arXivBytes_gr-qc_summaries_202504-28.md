## 0. Shadow curves and quasinormal modes for rotating black holes surrounded   by dark matter, radiation and dust

**Authors:** Reza Pourkhodabakhshi, Jorge G. Russo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18505v1)

**Summary:**

The impact of different fluid matter scenarios on the shadow of black holes (BH) and on frequencies of quasinormal modes (QNM) for a black hole subjected to scalar perturbations is studied. The analysis of the shadow reveals a dependence on the density parameter of fluid matter $k$, with larger shadow sizes for larger values of $k$ in the dark matter and dust cases. We also find that dark matter reduces the real part of the QNM frequencies and significantly increases the damping time, enhancing the prospects for gravitational wave detection.

## 1. Equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on   Finsler geometries

**Authors:** Loïc Marsot, Yuzhang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499v1)

**Summary:**

This article aims to derive equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries. The equations we obtain are the generalization of that of Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) The equations share the same properties as the MPD equations, and we mention different choices possible for supplementary conditions to close this system of equations. These equations have an additional requirement, which is the choice of what defines the tangent direction of the F Insler manifold.

## 2. Non-Minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills Black Holes: Fundamental Quasinormal   Mode and Grey-Body factors versus Outburst of Overtones

**Authors:** B. C. Lütfüoğlu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18482v1)

**Summary:**

An exact black hole solution in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory was obtained. Its quasinormal modes were subsequently analyzed using the JWKB approximation. We demonstrate that this analysis lacks sufficient accuracy when studying modes with $n$ overtones. The Yang-M Mills contribution primarily deforms the metric in the near-horizon region, while the geometry quickly transitions back to a Schwarzschild-like form at larger radii. The coupling enhances the grey-body factors, further increasing the transmission probability.

**Authors:** C. Garcia-Quintero, H. E. Noriega, A. de Mattia, A. Aviles, K. Lodha, D. Chebat, J. Rohlf, S. Nadathur, W. Elbers, J. Aguilar, S. Ahlen, O. Alves, U. Andrade, S. BenZvi, D. Bianchi, D.

Palanque-Delabrouille, J. Pan, W. J. Percival, F. Prada, I. Pérez-Ràfols, M. Rashkovetskyi, C. Ravoux, A. J. Ross, G. Rossi, E. Sanchez, D. Schlegel, M. Schubnell, A. Shafieloo, D. Sprayberry, G. Tarlé, P. Taylor, M. Vargas-Magaña, B. A. Weaver, C. Yèche, P. Zarrouk, Z. Zhai, R. Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18464v1)

**Summary:**

We report cosmological results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) when combined with recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) By jointly analyzing ACT and {\it Planck} data and applying conservative cuts to overlapping multipole ranges, we assess how different dataset combinations affect consistency with DESI. While the dark energy results remain quite consistent across various combinations of DESI and ACT likelihoods with those obtained by the DESI collaboration, the constraints on neutrino mass are more sensitive.

## 4. Quantum induced shock dynamics in gravitational collapse: insights from   effective models and numerical frameworks

**Authors:** Hongguang Liu, Dongxue Qu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18462v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the formation and evolution of shock waves in spherically symmetric gravitational collapse within a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) inspired effective framework. In this setting, the classical singularities are replaced by quantum-induced shell-crossing singularities, which are resolved through weak solutions such as shock waves. For small mass black holes near the Planck scale, the shock surface remains timelike and is shielded behind both inner and outer horizons. In contrast, for larger black hole masses, theshock surface develops spacelike segments, indicating a transition in the effective dynamics.

## 5. Generalizing the relativistic precession model of quasi-periodic   oscillations through anharmonic corrections

**Authors:** Roberto Giambò, Orlando Luongo, Marco Muccino, Alessandro Rossi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18403v1)

**Summary:**

We critically reanalyze the relativistic precession model of quasi-periodic oscillations. We show that the perturbed geodesic equations must include anharmonic contributions arising from the higher-order expansion of the effective potential. We carry out Monte Carlo-Markov chain analyses on eight neutron star sources. We speculate on possible refinements of the model, showing the need to revise it at a fundamental level.

## 6. On a lower-dimensional Killing vector origin of irreducible Killing   tensors

**Authors:** Finnian Gray, Gloria Odak, Pavel Krtouš, David Kubizňák

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18287v1)

**Summary:**

In this construction, the key ingredient for irreducibility is the non-commutativity of the underlying Killing vectors. It gives rise to a tower of growing rank Killing tensors determined by the structure constants of the corresponding Lie algebra. A canonical example of a metric with such emergent non-trivial hidden symmetries in all dimensions is provided by rotating (off-shell) generalized Lense-Thirring spacetimes. A physical on-shell realization of this construction in four dimensions is embodied by a rotating black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory.

## 7. ReGrayssion: Machine Learning-Based Analytical Expressions for Gray-Body   Factors and Application to Primordial Black Holes

**Authors:** Guan-Wen Yuan, Marco Calzà, Davide Pedrotti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18270v1)

**Summary:**

Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH) We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions.

## 8. Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves signaling Primordial Black Hole Dark   Matter

**Authors:** Cristian Joana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18237v1)

**Summary:**

 Primordial black holes are a unique probe of the early Universe and offer a potential link between inflationary dynamics and dark matter. We analyse PBH formation and the associated stochastic gravitational wave background from scalar induced gravitational waves, while taking into account the contributions from local non-Gaussianities. We highlight the observable consequences for the LISA and PTA experiments. The results are published in the journal Inui:2024fgk, published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 9. Phenomenology of Schwarzschild-like Black Holes with a Generalized   Compton Wavelength

**Authors:** Reggie C. Pantig, Ali Ovgun, Gaetano Lambiase

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18226v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18226v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the influence of the generalized Compton wavelength (GCW) on Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetimes. The GCW modifies the classical geometry through a deformation parameter $ \varepsilon $, encoding quantum gravitational backreaction. We derive exact analytical expressions for the black hole shadow radius, photon sphere, and weak deflection angle, incorporating higher-order corrections and finite-distance effects. Our results highlight the GCW framework as a phenomenologically viable semiclassical model, offering testable predictions for upcoming gravitational wave and VLBI observations.

## 10. Entanglement Harvesting from Quantum Field: Insights via the Partner   Formula

**Authors:** Yuki Osawa, Yasusada Nambu, Riku Yoshimoto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18129v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the condition necessary for extracting entanglement from a quantum field. Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between "real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation. We show that Simon'sEntanglement criterion for the bipartite Gaussian state can be reformulated in terms of commutators between the canonical operators of the detector mode B and the partner mode P.

## 11. Measurement of the inner horizon in the analog of rotating BTZ black   holes by an improved photon fluid

**Authors:** Siyao Wu, Ling Chen, Bolong Yi, Lei Li, Baocheng Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18120v1)

**Summary:**

A vortex beam carrying an improved phase can simulate the rotating BTZ black holes experimentally. We develop a new photon fluid model in a graphene/methanol thermal optical solution. We measure the variation of photon fluid velocity with the radial position using a Fourier plane light spot localization method. The result provides an extension for the application of optical vortex and a potential possibility for the future experimental exploration about the properties of BTZblack holes and even the anti-de Sitter space.

## 12. The equivalence between Einstein and Jordan frames: a study based on the   inflationary magnetogenesis model

**Authors:** Hang Wang, Shuang Liu, Yu Li, Yao-chuan Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18005v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18005v1)

**Summary:**

The equivalence of the Jordan and Einstein frames has been a subject of considerable interest in the field. During inflation, the magnetic field transitions to a blue spectrum, whereas in the Jordan frame, it evolves into a red spectrum. We also establish the conditions under which both frames may exhibit scale-invariant spectra simultaneously during the inflationary period. We investigate the post-inflationary evolution of the magneticField's energy density in both frames, uncovering that for scale-Invariant Spectra in the Einstein frame during inflation, it transitions to red.

## 13. The Impact of Inhomogeneous Perturbations of the Inflaton on the   Cosmological Primordial Magnetic Field

**Authors:** Yu Li, Shuang Liu, Hang Wang, Yao-Chuan Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18000v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the impact of inhomogeneous inflaton perturbations on primordial magnetic fields within the framework of generalized inflationary magnetogenesis models. We demonstrate that the standard Coulomb gauge must be generalized to accommodate spatial inhomogeneities. We also find that the spectrum index evolution is sensitive to the sign of $V_{\phi}$, with distinctive behaviors for electric and magnetic fields under different scale-invariance conditions. The perturbative effects shift the spectral index towards the red and migrate toward smaller scales as inflation progresses.
