## 0. Formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein--Maxwell--charged scalar   field system

**Authors:** Dawei Shen, Jingbo Wan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19976v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we prove a scale-critical trapped surface formation result for the Einstein--Maxwell--charged scalar field (EMCSF) system, without any symmetry assumptions. We show that the focusing of gravitational waves, the concentration of electromagnetic fields, or the condensation of complex scalar fields, each individually, can lead to the formation of a trapped surface. In addition, we capture a nontrivial charging process along past null infinity, which introduces new difficulties due to the abnormal behavior of the matter fields.

## 1. Quantum Gravity Signatures of Gravitons in a Squeezed Coherent State on   Detectors within a Harmonic Trap Potential

**Authors:** Anom Trenggana, Freddy P. Zen, Seramika Ariwahjoedi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19971v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum gravity signatures emerge in a gravitational wave detector placed inside a harmonic potential trap. We compared the transition probabilities of the detector in scenarios where the gravitational wave is quantized versus when it is treated classically. We found that for graviton states such as coherent, squeezed, and squeezed coherent states, quantum gravity signatures can emerge in events that would not be possible when the graviton state is a quantum state with $n_G$ particles, such as graviton annihilation and the increasing energy level by two levels in final state.

## 2. Approximating neutron-star radii using gravitational-wave only   measurements with symbolic regression

**Authors:** Micha≈Ç Bejger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19962v1)

**Summary:**

An expression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data would be advantageous for the multi-messenger astronomy. Binary neutron star inspirals detected as gravitational waves carry information on components' masses and tidal deformabilities, but not radii. Using pySR, a symbolic regression method trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input, an approximate symbolic expression is obtained. The approximation is tested on piecewisepolytropic. EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on various non-poly Tropic Eoss based on realistic theories of dense matter.

## 3. Gravitational lensing by $k-n$ generalized black-bounce space-times

**Authors:** C. Furtado, A. L. A. Moreira, J. R. Nascimento, A. Yu. Petrov, P. J. Porfirio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19920v1)

**Summary:**

We study gravitational lensing by $k-n$ generalized black-bounce space-times. These metrics interpolate between regular black holes and one-way or traversable wormholes. First, we investigate the light-like geodesic trajectories and derive an analytical expression for the deflection angle in terms of the bounce parameter. We then turn to the strong-field gravitational regime and display the behavior of the bending angle as a function of both the impact parameter and the bounce parameters.

## 4. Log supertranslations at Spatial Infinity

**Authors:** Sharad Mishra, Kinjal Banerjee, Jishnu Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19910v1)

**Summary:**

We show that it is possible to relax certain smoothness requirements of the asymptotic transformations considered previously. This leads to an enhancement of the symmetry group that includes logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity. Our results complement several recent results which confirm the existence of supertranslated spacetimes in the Hamiltonian formalism.

## 5. Cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model

**Authors:** Ali Nezhadsafavi, Levon Pogosian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19830v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19830v1)

**Summary:**

We study cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model, a scalar-tensor theory with a spontaneously broken local $U(1)$ symmetry. Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially attach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the requirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system limits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter, analogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic structure formation.

## 6. Multi-Parameter Transitions in Cosmological Calibrators: A Resolution to   the Hubble Tension from SH0ES Data Analysis

**Authors:** Mohit K. Sharma, Leandros Perivolaropoulos, M. Sami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19807v1)

**Summary:**

The Hubble tension remains one of the most significant challenges in cosmology. We investigate the impact of simultaneous transitions in multiple Cepheid and SNIa calibration parameters at specific cosmic distances. We demonstrate that the post-transition SNia absolute magnitude aligns more closely with CMB-based constraints, resulting in a reduced Hubble constant value that alleviates the tension. Our findings suggest that the Hubble tension might be resolved through proper modeling of calibration parameter inhomogeneities rather than requiring new physics.

## 7. Penrose inequality for integral energy conditions

**Authors:** Eduardo Hafemann, Eleni-Alexandra Kontou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19794v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19794v1)

**Summary:**

The classical Penrose inequality is a relation between the ADM mass and the area of any cross section of the black hole event horizon. If it fails, the trapped surface is not necessarily behind the event horizon and a naked singularity could form. In this work we provide two generalizations of the inequality spherically symmetric spacetimes. The latter case could also be applicable to quantum fields. Finally, we provide physically motivated examples for both of the generalizations and examples for evaporating black holes.

## 8. Regular black hole solutions in $(2 + 1)$-dimensional $f(R,T)$ gravity   coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics

**Authors:** Miguel A. S. Pinto, Roberto V. Maluf, Gonzalo J. Olmo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19700v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate regular black hole solutions in the (2+1)-dimensional versions of General Relativity and $f(R, T)$ gravity, both coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. By admitting that the matter content that generates such geometries satisfies the Maxwell limit condition, we obtain a class of regular black holes that give rise to new solutions. We also explore both qualitatively and quantitatively the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor present in those solutions.

## 9. Unified Non-Singular Cosmology with Late-Time Acceleration through a   Novel Parametrization of Bulk Viscosity Coefficient

**Authors:** Rajdeep Mazumdar, Mrinnoy M. Gohain, Kalyan Bhuyan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19691v1)

**Summary:**

This work explores the influence of viscous fluids on cosmological dynamics within the framework of General Relativity. We introduce a novel time-dependent parametrization for the bulk viscosity coefficient. Remarkably, the general solutions emerging from our model exhibit significant flexibility, accommodating not only a bouncing universe but also an early inflationary phase and a late-time acceleration mimicking dark energy. We confront our theoretical predictions with observational data sets, including the BAO, DESI and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets.

## 10. Observational constraints in late time for an axially symmetric   transitioning model with bulk viscous fluid

**Authors:** G. K. Goswami, Anirudh Pradhan, Vipin Chandra Dubey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19523v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we explore an axially symmetric Bianchi type-I model of the universe with bulk viscous fluid as a source of gravitational field under the framework of Einstein's field equations. The model parameters have been estimated with the help of four data sets. The study reveals that the model behaves like a quintessence in late time and approaches the $\Lambda$ CDM model. Some other geometrical parameters like the Jerk parameter and the Om diagnostic are also being discussed to clarify the nature of the dark energy model.

## 11. Exploring Ultralight Dark Matter Self-Coupling via the Gravitational   Wave Background

**Authors:** Pratick Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19505v1)

**Summary:**

Supermassive black hole binary mergers serve as prominent sources of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) If dark matter-induced friction is present in the vicinity of these mergers, it can lead to suppression in the nanohertz frequency range of the SGWB spectrum. In particular, ultralight dark matter (ULDM) forming compact solitonic cores around supermassive black holes can imprint signatures in PTA observations. Our analysis places limits on the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM.
