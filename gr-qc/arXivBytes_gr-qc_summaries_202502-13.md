## 0. Bridging time across null horizons

**Authors:** Anıl Zenginoğlu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08581v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08581v1)

**Summary:**

General relativity allows the description of physical phenomena in a wide variety of coordinate systems. In the presence of boundaries, such as event horizons and null infinity, time coordinates must be carefully adapted to the global causal structure of spacetime. Horizon-penetrating time is used to describe the dynamics of infalling matter and radiation across the event horizon, while hyperboloidal time isused to study the propagation of radiation toward the idealized observer at null infinity. The insights developed here offer practical tools for numerical relativity, gravitational wave astronomy, and other explorations of the large-scale structure of spacetimes.

## 1. The Role of Conceptual Problem Solving in Learning Physics: A Study in a   General Relativity University Course

**Authors:** Matteo Tuveri, Andrea Pierfrancesco Sanna, Mariano Cadoni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08564v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08564v1)

**Summary:**

Effective physics learning requires balancing mathematical formalism with conceptual understanding. Conceptual problem-solving involves connecting math to physical reality. Using an epistemological framework like problem framing helps students justify their mathematical decisions. This approach deepens students' understanding by linking theory to practice and enhancing their reasoning skills. The research highlights the importance of symbol sense and the cyclical nature of problem framing. It suggests that a more integrated approach, incorporating visual, symbolic, and natural language elements, could enhance students' conceptual understanding of GR.

## 2. Interacting Early Dark Energy

**Authors:** Yousef Bisabr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08541v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08541v1)

**Summary:**

We explore a model of interacting Early Dark Energy (EDE) in which a minimally coupled scalar field, representing the EDE, interacts with the radiation sector through an exponential coupling function. This framework can be inspired by modified theories of gravity, including $f(R)$ gravity, the Einstein frame representation of Brans-Dicke theory, and chameleon gravity. Our results indicate that $r$ diminishes as the Universe expands, which is essential for a successful EDE model.

## 3. Fast Radio Bursts as cosmological proxies: estimating the Hubble   constant

**Authors:** Eduard Fernando Piratova-Moreno, Luz Ángela García, Carlos A. Benavides-Gallego, Carolina Cabrera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08509v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08509v1)

**Summary:**

The Hubble tension is a discrepancy in the predicted expansion rate of the Universe. We leverage the sensitivity of the Dispersion Measure (DM) from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the Hubble factor to investigate the Hubble tension. We build a catalog of 98 localized FRBs and an independent mock catalog and employ 3 methods to calculate the best value of the $H_0$ The increase in the number of confirmed FRBs will provide us, in combination with other observations, with a robust prediction of the Hubble constant.

## 4. One loop analysis of the cubic action for gravity

**Authors:** Enrique Alvarez, Jesus Anero, Carmelo P. Martin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08434v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze some aspects of the cubic action for gravity recently proposed by Cheung and Remmen. In this approach both the spacetime metric and the connection are treated as independent fields. We discuss its BRST invariance and compute explicitly the one-loop contribution of quantum fluctuations around flat space, checking that the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identities are fulfilled. Finally, our results on a first order action are compared with the existing ones corresponding to a second order action. Back to Mail Online home.

## 5. Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset   cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data

**Authors:** Shulei Cao, Bharat Ratra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429v1)

**Summary:**

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$) We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation andcosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlated. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 exhibit $>2\sigma$ tension.

## 6. Quantum Gravity Without Metric Quantization: From Hidden Variables to   Hidden Spacetime Curvatures

**Authors:** Mohamed Hatifi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08421v1)

**Summary:**

Bohmian mechanics offers a deterministic alternative to conventional quantum theory through well-defined particle trajectories. While successful in nonrelativistic contexts, its extension to curved spacetime-and hence quantum gravity-remains unresolved. In our approach, measuring the gravitational potential at a point unveils a pre-existing trajectory and its associated curvature. This new approach has far-reaching implications for the role of determinism and potential observational signatures of quantum non-equilibrium in cosmology.

## 7. The shadow and accretion disk images of the rotation loop quantum black   bounce

**Authors:** Ke-Jian He, Huan Ye, Xiao-Xiong Zeng, Li-Fang Li, Peng Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08388v1)

**Summary:**

Study of Kerr-like Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) inspired black bounce. As inclination increases, the direct and lensed images diverge, creating a structure resembling a hat. Results may provide a potential approach to limit black hole parameters, detect quantum gravity effects, and distinguish the LQG black hole from other black hole models, say the authors of the paper. The results show that the distribution of redshift and observed intensity is obviously related to the behavior of accretion flow.

## 8. Scale Invariant Dark Energy

**Authors:** Alessandro Tronconi, Giovanni Venturi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08334v1)

**Summary:**

A global scale-invariant Dark Energy model based on Induced Gravity with the addition of a small $R^2$ contribution is examined. The scalar field (quintessence), playing the role of Dark Energy, has a quartic potential and generates Newton's constant with its non-minimal coupling. The solutions to this model are obtained analytically through a perturbative expansion and oscillate with transplanckian frequency. They are then compared with similar solutions found for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology plus $R$2$. Finally scalarField production is perturbatively taken into account in a simple model and the resulting effects illustrated.

## 9. Normalizing Fock space states in static spacetimes

**Authors:** Jesse Huhtala, Iiro Vilja

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08325v1)

**Summary:**

In quantum field theory, sharp momentum states have to be normalized to be in Fock space. We investigate different normalization schemes, both box normalization and wave packets. These methods are equivalent in flat spacetimes, but turn out to produce different results in curved spacetime. This means that scattering processes have to. be defined in relation to the normalization scheme used, rather than being. independent of it as is the case in flat spacetime. We provide an illustrative example of this phenomenon.

## 10. Quantum corrected Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes in semiclassical   gravity

**Authors:** Ben Kain

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08278v1)

**Summary:**

We study Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) black holes in semiclassical gravity by including in the field equations the expectation value of a renormalized energy-momentum tensor in the Polyakov approximation. In our system, which contains black hole hair, we find quantum corrected solutions in which the classical horizon disappears and is replaced by a wormhole structure, similarly to what is found in vacuum. Our results indicate that the inclusion of black hole Hair in semiclassesical gravity still leads to the disappearance of classical horizons for nonextremal black holes.

## 11. Simulating Hawking radiation in quantum many-body systems: deviations   from the thermal spectrum

**Authors:** Gokhan Alkac, Ege Özgün

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08199v1)

**Summary:**

A correspondence between quantum field theories in two-dimensional curved spacetime and quantum many-body systems enables the simulation of Hawking radiation in static background spacetimes. In particular, we demonstrate that deviations from the thermal spectrum, as predicted by the well-known tunneling method, can be observed in many- body simulations. We investigate a recently proposed one-to-one correspondence between Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Many-body Systems. We demonstrate that this correspondence can be used to simulate Hawking radiation.

## 12. Instability of Slowly Expanding FLRW Spacetimes

**Authors:** Elliot Marshall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08095v1)

**Summary:**

This article builds on the work of Fajman et. al. in which perturbations of the homogeneous fluid solution on a fixed, decelerating FLRW background were studied. Our numerical results show that for all values of $K$, perturbation of the FLRW solution develop shocks in finite time. This behaviour contrasts known results for spacetimes with accelerated expansion in which shock formation is suppressed. We numerically study, under a Gowdy symmetry assumption, nonlinear perturbings of the decelerated FLRW fluid solutions to the Einstein-Euler system.

## 13. Exploring Cosmological Implications of the Modified Raychaudhuri   Equation in Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy Theory

**Authors:** Arijit Panda, Eduardo Guendelman, Goutam Manna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08094v1)

**Summary:**

This article investigates the modified Raychaudhuri Equation (RE) in the context of Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy (NGVE) theory. The equation is formulated based on the NGVE framework, in which global scale invariance generates a unique geometry. The newly developed geometry introduces a metric that is conformally connected to the conventional metric. The cosmological study is carried out under the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe.
