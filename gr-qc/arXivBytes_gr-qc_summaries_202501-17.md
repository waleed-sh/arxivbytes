## 0. Finite-time Unruh effect: Waiting for the transient effects to fade off

**Authors:** D. Jaffino Stargen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09676v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the transition probability rate of a Unruh-DeWitt (UD) detector interacting with massless scalar field for a finite duration of proper time, $T$ of the detector. For a UD detector moving at a uniform acceleration, $a$, we explicitly show that the finite-time transition probability rates can be written as a sum of purely thermal terms, and non-thermal transient terms. We comment on the possibilities of bringing down the exponentially large thermalization time at small accelerations, $ a\ll\Delta E$.

## 1. Twistorial chiral algebras in higher dimensions

**Authors:** Tim Adamo, Iustin Surubaru

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09627v1)

**Summary:**

In four spacetime dimensions, the classically integrable self-dual sectors of gauge theory and gravity have associated chiral algebras. These emerge naturally from their description in twistor space. Using twistor sigma models to describe these sectors, we demonstrate that they also arise as soft symmetry algebraes under a certain notion of collinear limit. We show that there are similar chiralAlgebra associated to integrables sectors of gravity and gauge theory in $4m$-dimensions.

## 2. Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. IV. Hubble tension and the   cosmological constant

**Authors:** V. G. Gurzadyan, N. N. Fimin, V. M. Chechetkin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09598v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09598v1)

**Summary:**

The formation of the cosmic structures in the late Universe is considered using Vlasov kinetic approach. The crucial point is the use of the gravitational potential with repulsive term of the cosmological constant which provides a solution to the Hubble tension. This also provides a mechanism of formation of stationary semi-periodic gravitating structures of voids and walls. The considered mechanism of the structure formation then is succeeding the epoch described by the evolution of primordial density fluctuations. The cosmologically constant has a role of the scaling and hence can be compared with observational data for given regions.

## 3. One-variable Metrics in String Theory

**Authors:** M. Fakhredin, W. A. Sabra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09537v1)

**Summary:**

Exact solutions depending on one variable of gravitational theory with antisymmetric tensor and a coupled dilaton field are obtained in arbitrary space-time dimensions. These solutions are relevant to M-theory, type IIA and type IIB supergravity theories in various space- time signatures. The solutions are also relevant to the theory of supergravity in the form of a supergravity boson. They can be found in the book "Gravitational Theory: Theories of Supergravity" by Richard Feynman, published by Springer.

## 4. Finslerian structure of black holes

**Authors:** Hengameh R. Dehkordi, Mauricio Richartz, Alberto Saa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09536v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09536v1)

**Summary:**

There has been an increasing interest in the Finslerian interpretation of null geodesics in the exterior regions of stationary black holes. Recent mathematical advancements in the critical and strong Zermelo navigation problems and their connections to Kropina and Lorentz-Finsler metrics enable the extension of this framework. We illustrate our results with explicit physical examples, focusing on spherically symmetric and Kerr black hole. Our findings provide new insights into the "river model" of black holes, offering enhanced visual representations of nullGeodesics on ergosurfaces, horizons, and within their interior regions.

## 5. The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the   area law

**Authors:** Ginestra Bianconi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09491v1)

**Summary:**

The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results. Although the Schwarzfeld metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling limit.

## 6. Observable Signatures of RN Black Holes with Dark Matter Halos via   Strong Gravitational Lensing and Constraints from EHT Observations

**Authors:** Niyaz Uddin Molla, Himanshu Chaudhary, Salvatore Capozziello, Farruh Atamurotov, G. Mustafa, Ujjal Debnath

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09439v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09439v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the impact of dark matter halos on the gravitational lensing produced by electrically charged, spherically symmetric black holes in the strong-field regime. The study focuses on two dark matter models: the Universal Rotation Curve Model and the cold dark matter model. We find that the strong deflection angle, $\alpha_D$ , increases with the charge parameter $Q$ in the presence of a dark matter halo. Our findings suggest that charged black holes with dark Matter halos can be differentiated from standard black holes.

## 7. Thermodynamics of charged rotating black strings in extended phase space

**Authors:** Hamid R. Bakhtiarizadeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09375v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the thermodynamics of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black strings in extended phase space. We find, the thermodynamic volume, the internal energy, and the Smarr law. Some of the solutions have positive specific heat, which makes them thermodynamically stable. We also study the maximal efficiency of a Penrose process for solutions and find that an extremal rotating black string can have an efficiency of up to 50% compared to the corresponding value of 0%, when the cosmological constant is zero.

## 8. Maxwell-$f(Q)$ theory

**Authors:** G. G. L. Nashed

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09373v1)

**Summary:**

The four-dimensional AdS black hole is crucial within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We analyze the singularities of such a solution, computing all the quantities of different curvature and non-metricity invariants. We examine several physical characteristics of black holes from a thermodynamics perspective and demonstrate the existence of an outer event horizon in addition to the inner Cauchy horizons. Finally, we derive a class of rotating black hole in $f(Q)$ gravity that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter charged.

## 9. Reassessing aspects of the photon's LQG-modified dispersion relations

**Authors:** P. A. L. Mourão, G. L. L. W. Levy, J. A. Helayël-Neto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09370v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09370v1)

**Summary:**

The study is based on a scenario based on the effects of the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) on the electromagnetic sector of the Standard Model of Fundamental Interactions and Particle Physics. Among these, we contemplate the combined effect between the LQG parameters and a homogeneous background magnetic field on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, considering in detail issues like group velocities and refractive indices of the QED vacuum. We conclude that there emerges an interesting nonlinear profile in the wavelengths of both the incoming and the deflected photons.

## 10. Cosmological Solutions in Scalar-Tensor theory via the Eisenhart-Duval   lift

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09356v1)

**Summary:**

We implement the Einsenhart-Duval lift in scalar-tensor gravity as a means to construct integrable cosmological models and analytic solutions. We employ a geometric criterion to constrain the free functions of the theory such that the field equations can be written in the equivalent form of linear equations. This geometric linearization is achieved by the introduction of an extended minisuperspace description. The results are applied to construct analytic solutions in modified theories of gravity such as the $f\left( R\right) $-theory and the hybrid metric-Palatini.

## 11. Super-entropy bumblebee AdS black holes

**Authors:** B. Eslam Panah

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09317v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermodynamic instability for the bumblebee AdS black holes. We evaluate the effect of the bumblesbee field (or Lorentz-violating parameter) on the event horizon. In non-extended phase space, we investigate the heat capacity and the Helmholtz free energy to investigate the local and global thermal stability areas. We extend our study on the extended phase space by seeking on stable area by using the Heat capacity at constant pressure ($C_{P}$). Finally, we evaluate the super-entropy black hole condition.

## 12. The effect of accretion on scalar superradiant instability

**Authors:** Yin-Da Guo, Shou-Shan Bao, Tianjun Li, Hong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09280v1)

**Summary:**

Superradiance can lead to the formation of a black hole (BH) condensate system. We investigate the accretion effect on the evolution of this system. Accretion could significantly enhance the gravitational wave (GW) emission and reduce its duration. We also show that the GW beat signature is similarly modified. We obtain the analytical approximations of all important quantities, which can be directly applied to phenomenological studies. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 13. Acceleration temperature for quantum fields without event horizon

**Authors:** F. Sobrero, M. S. Soares, T. Guerreiro, N. F. Svaiter

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09264v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate unitarily inequivalent representations of the algebra of operators in quantum field theory. In those cases that exist a Fock representation of the commutation relations, we have a unique no-quanta state. We examine more closely the operational definition of a measuring device which detect a quantum of an Hermitian scalar field. The Unruh-DeWitt and Glauber model of quanta detectors are discussed. The transition probability per unit proper time of both detectors is studied in two different non-inertial frames of reference.

## 14. Physical characteristics and causality of cosmological models in   generalized matter-geometry coupling gravity theory with observational   constraints

**Authors:** Dinesh Chandra Maurya, Javlon Rayimbaev, Inomjon Ibragimov, Sokhibjan Muminov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09247v1)

**Summary:**

In the generalized matter-geometry coupling theory, we investigate the physical characteristics and causality of some new cosmological models for a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime filled with stiff, radiation, dust, and curvature fluid sources. We find that all models in the late-time universe exhibit transit-phase acceleration, and Models I and II show both the early as well as late time accelerating phase of the expanding universe. We found the current values of the deceleration parameter in the range $-0.886\le q_{0}\le- 0.54$ with transition redshift.
