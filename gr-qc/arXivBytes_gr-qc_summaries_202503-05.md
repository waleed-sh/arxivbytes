## 0. A New $\sim 5Ïƒ$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI DR1   and DES-SN5YR observations

**Authors:** Purba Mukherjee, Anjan A Sen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02880v1)

**Summary:**

We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_A) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. We derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts.

## 1. Conservative Dynamics of Relativistic Binaries Beyond Einstein Gravity

**Authors:** Jordan Wilson-Gerow

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02867v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of spinless compact objects in a general effective theory of gravity. We compute the radial action in a post-Minkowskian approximation for scattering orbits, to two-loop order. The result encodes the fully relativistic dynamics of the compact objects, and serves as a generating function for gauge-invariant orbital observables for both bound and unbound binary systems. Where overlapping post-Newtonian results are available, we've verified agreement. We also study a general multi-scalar-tensor theory ofgravity to order $\ell^{4}.

## 2. Signatures of Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion gravity from the observed   quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes

**Authors:** Anirban Dasgupta, Nishant Tiwari, Indrani Banerjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02708v1)

**Summary:**

String-inspired models are often believed to provide an interesting framework for quantum gravity and force unification. The EMDA gravity has interesting cosmological implications and hence it is worthwhile to explore the footprints of such a theory in available astrophysical observations. We compare the model dependent QPO frequencies with the available observations of five BH sources. From the current data the EMDA scenario cannot be ruled out in favor of general relativity. We comment on the implications and limitations of our finding and how the present constrains compare with the existing literature.

## 3. The 18-cycle in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$: Combined Linear Local   Passage and Numerical Simulation

**Authors:** Johannes Buchner

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02684v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we find an example for a periodic heteroclinic chain that allows Takens Linearization at all base points. We then show that the combined cinear local passage at the 18-cycle is a contraction. We conclude with a discussion on how to proceed further in studying Bianchi cosmologies, and also discuss directions for future research in inhomogeneous (PDE-) cosmological models. The appendix contains symbolic and computations done by Mathematica for examples discussed throughout the text.

## 4. Finite collisionless accretion disks in the Kerr spacetime

**Authors:** Ghafran Khan, Patryk Mach

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02666v1)

**Summary:**

We construct general-relativistic kinetic models of stationary finite accretion disks in the Kerr spacetime. We investigate monoenergetic configurations, as well as models characterized by Maxwell-J\"{u}ttner type distributions. In both cases, we consider particles moving along orbits reaching the outer boundary of the disk, either plunging into the black hole, or scattered by the centrifugal barrier. The location of the outer disk boundary affects the mass and angular momentum accretion rates at a similar order of magnitude as the temperature parameter.

## 5. Quantum representation of reduced twisted geometry in loop quantum   gravity

**Authors:** Gaoping Long, Cong Zhang, Hongguang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02641v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum representation of the algebra among reduced twisted geometries (with respect to the Gauss constraint) is constructed in the gauge invariant Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity. It is shown that the reduced twisted geometric variables not only describe the spatial discrete geometry more clearly, but also form a simple Poisson algebra which is analogous to that in quantum mechanics. This quantum representation also leads to fundamental operators associated with reduced twisted geometry. Based on these fundamental operators, a new type of extrinsic curvature operator is constructed.

## 6. Can Horndeski Genesis be Nonpathological?

**Authors:** Han Gil Choi, Pavel Petrov, Masahide Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02626v1)

**Summary:**

We present a minimal setup within the framework of Horndeski gravity that can describe a nonpathological Genesis scenario. Our setup allows for a fully stable transition to the kination epoch, during which General Relativity is restored. This Genesis scenario circumvents the no-go theorem at the cost of encountering the risk of strong coupling in the past. We also suggest a deformation of the model that enables us to achieve sufficiently small values for the r ratio. Finally, we discuss the geodesic (in)completeness of the current model.

## 7. Gravitational wave probes of particle dark matter: a review

**Authors:** Andrew L. Miller

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02607v1)

**Summary:**

Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors.

## 8. High-frequency magnetic response measurement of test mass with a   fluxgate magnetometer for gravitational wave detection

**Authors:** Yuanyang Yu, Butian Zhang, Shengxin Lin, Jianping Liang, Donghua Pan, Shun Wang, Ze-Bing Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02588v1)

**Summary:**

Magnetic fields with frequencies higher than 1 Hz can still contribute to the noise through down conversion effect. We propose a magnetic field response measurement method by directly probing the induced magnetic field of the test mass placed in a spatially uniform magnetic field. The frequency can be measured up to 1500 Hz, satisfying the requirement of space-borne gravitational wave detection.

## 9. Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around   Massive Black Holes

**Authors:** Zi-Chang Zhang, Hai-Chao Yuan, Yong Tang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573v1)

**Summary:**

Distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos. We find that the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.

## 10. Electric Penrose process and collisions of particles near   five-dimensional weakly charged Schwarzschild black hole

**Authors:** Tursunali Xamidov, Mirzabek Alloqulov, Sanjar Shaymatov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02546v1)

**Summary:**

The particle dynamics and the electric Penrose process for the five-dimensional weakly charged Schwarzschild black hole are studied. The radial profile of the effective potential is plotted for different values of the BH charge. The appropriate plots were obtained and compared with the results for the four-dimensional Schwarzschild BH. Also, we obtained the constraints on mass and charge of black hole to accelerate protons of different energies ($1$-$10^{9}$ GeV). Finally, collisions of electrically charged particles near the horizon of the 5D BH were studied.

## 11. Late Time Cosmic Acceleration in Modified Gravity and Gauss-Bonnet   Cosmology

**Authors:** Santosh V. Lohakare

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02467v1)

**Summary:**

Late-time acceleration of the Universe has posed a significant challenge to contemporary cosmology. General relativity addresses this by introducing the cosmological constant. This model has limitations, leading cosmologists to explore alternative explanations. These alternatives range from models involving a dynamic dark fluid known as dark energy, to large-scale modifications of gravitational interaction, known as modified gravity. This thesis focuses on late-time cosmic acceleration within modified theories of gravity, using various observational data sets and statistical analysis. The Universe is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic and is described by the Friedmann Lema Lema Robertson Walker metric.

## 12. Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supergravity

**Authors:** Ioseph Buchbinder, Evgeny Ivanov, Nikita Zaigraev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02438v1)

**Summary:**

We review the superfield formulation of higher-spin supergravity theory in harmonic superspace. The analysis of both the hypermultiplet higher- spin supersymmetries and conformal supersymmetry is performed. Based on these results, the consistent interaction of an infinite tower of superconformal higher spins with hypermultIPlet is presented. We then propose a method to construct a consistent interacting theory of $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher- Spin supergravity by making use of the conformal compensators.

## 13. A common origin of two accelerating universes: inflation and dark energy

**Authors:** Kunio Kaneta, Kin-ya Oda, Motohiko Yoshimura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02409v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a quantum theory of inflaton and its decay product of various gauge boson pairs to investigate the preheating towards thermalized universe. The inflaton decay into gauge-boson pairs is shown to be inevitably accompanied by tachyon-mass-like correction to inflation potential. This gives rise to a conversion mechanism of early inflationary acceleration to a quintessence dark energy acceleration at late stages of cosmic evolution. The success of the escape depends on how standard particles are incorporated into a scheme of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity.

## 14. Cosmic Acceleration from Nothing

**Authors:** Michael R. R. Good, Eric V. Linder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02380v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate that if the universe started as a vacuum fluctuation rather than from a singular Big Bang state, the universe must have a late-time cosmic acceleration. This is required by a ``cosmological sum rule'' derived using the Schwarzian form of the Friedmann equations. We discuss possible connections to conformal and M\"obius transformations, and also compute that the best fit present cosmic data is consistent with the necessary crossing of the Schwartzian through zero having occurred (while it would not yet have happened in a $CDM cosmology)

## 15. Testing the behaviour of exotic matter near wormhole throat in $f(R,T)$   gravity

**Authors:** Payel Sarkar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02350v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02350v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, I propose a static wormhole model within modified $f(R,T)$ gravity. The wormhole solutions have been evolved in four cases: three different shape function along with redshift. I also have explored the energy conditions and the behaviour of exotic matter within the wormhole in all scenarios. Presence of exotic Matter violates necessary energy conditions near wormhole throat. This gives constraint on modified gravity parameter $\lambda$ in all different cases. In all scenarios, exotic Matter is not present.

## 16. Curled orbit and epicyclic oscillation of charged particles around the   weakly magnetized black hole in the presence of Lorentz violation

**Authors:** Hai-Yang Zhang, Ya-Peng Hu, Yu-Sen An

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02323v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02323v1)

**Summary:**

Charged particles have curled orbits around the black hole which can only appear in the presence of a magnetic field. The black hole shadow for Schwarzschild-like bumblebee black hole degenerates to the ordinary Schwarzschild black hole. The constraints we obtained using the method of quasi-period oscillation is crucial for further searching for the imprint of Lorentz symmetry violation in our universe, say the authors of the paper. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Light.

## 17. Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from   local geometrical invariants and matter distributions

**Authors:** Takahisa Igata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We propose a novel analytical framework that connects its physical origin to local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities and properties of the matter distributions. This finding not only accounts for the behavior observed in the Schwarzschild spacetime but also provides a unified description applicable to a variety of spacetime, including naked singularities and wormholes supported by a massless scalar field.

## 18. Residual test to search for microlensing signatures in strongly lensed   gravitational wave signals

**Authors:** Eungwang Seo, Xikai Shan, Justin Janquart, Otto A. Hannuksela, Martin A. Hendry, Bin Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02186v1)

**Summary:**

When a gravitational wave signal encounters a massive object, such as a galaxy or galaxy cluster, it undergoes strong gravitational lensing. These strongly lensed signals exhibit identical waveform morphology in the frequency domain. However, stellar fields and dark matter substructures within the galactic lens introduce microlensing effects that alter individual signal morphologies. Identifying thesemicrolensing signatures is computationally challenging within Bayesian frameworks. We find that 31% (55%) and 45% (65%) of microlensed events can be discerned with O4 (O5) detector sensitivities.

## 19. Shadows aspect of rotating black holes in the Einstein-AdS   SU(N)-nonlinear sigma model

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi, Y. Sekhmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02179v1)

**Summary:**

Recent observations of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have opened new avenues for testing gravity theories through black hole shadow observables. These observations offer a means to distinguish between general relativity and modified gravity theories while providing insights into the astrophysical properties of the observed black holes. In this work, we investigate photon orbits and shadow characteristics of rotating black holes within the Einstein-$\mathrm{SU(N)}$ nonlinear sigma model.

## 20. The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the   signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle   configuration

**Authors:** Matteo Di Giovanni, Davide Rozza, Rosario De Rosa, Enrico Calloni, Domenico D'Urso, Luca Naticchioni, Annalisa Allocca, Giovanni Luca Cardello, Alessandro Cardini, Andrea Contu, Giovanni Diaferia, Luciano Errico, Carlo Giunchi, Jan Harms, Marco Olivieri, Piero Rapagnani, Fulvio Ricci, Valeria Sipala, Lucia Trozzo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein Telescope (ET) is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals. Local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies. Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of SNR performances.
