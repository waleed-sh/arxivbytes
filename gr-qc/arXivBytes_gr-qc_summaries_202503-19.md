## 0. Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts

**Authors:** Ruiqi Wang, Bo-Qiang Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471v1)

**Summary:**

The KM3NeT Collaboration released the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec.=-7.8\degree on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic Neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet. There has been a speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 Pev neutrinos with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation.

## 1. Scalar Field Static Spherically Symmetric Solutions in Teleparallel   $F(T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Alexandre Landry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14465v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14465v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the static radial coordinate-dependent spherically symmetric spacetime in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity for a scalar field source. We compute new non-trivial telepar parallel $F('T') solutions by using a power-law coframe ansatz for each scalar potential case arising from the conservation laws. We apply this formula to find new exact $F'T' solutions for several cases of coframe Ansatz parameter. The new $F's will be relevant for {studying the models close to Born--Infeld and/or scalarized Black Hole (BH) solutions inside theDE)

**Summary:**

We use new cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) to test foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model. We find no evidence for self-interacting dark radiation, early-universe variation of fundamental constants, early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or modified recombination. In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble constant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the primary CMB are not favored by our data.

## 3. Quantum thermal machines in BTZ black hole spacetime

**Authors:** Dimitris Moustos, Obinna Abah

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14370v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14370v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium. The detector is coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases.

## 4. Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity

**Authors:** Nikolaos Dimakis, Alex Giacomini, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Grigorios Panotopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.

## 5. Stable Wormholes in Conformal Gravity

**Authors:** Mariano Cadoni, Leonardo Modesto, Mirko Pitzalis, Andrea Pierfrancesco Sanna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14214v1)

**Summary:**

A class of Lorentzian traversable wormholes in conformal gravity, constructed via Weyl rescaling of Minkowski spacetime. We argue that, when the Weyl symmetry is spontaneously broken, the broken symmetry phase may lead to a stable "wormhole phase" alternative to the flat "Minkowski phase" These wormholes are solutions of every theory of gravity that is both conformally invariant and admits Minkowsi spacetime as a solution. They are also stable at the linear perturbation level.

## 6. Gravitational-wave Extraction using Independent Component Analysis

**Authors:** Rika Shimomura, Yuuichi Tabe, Hisaaki Shinkai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14179v1)

**Summary:**

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a method to extract a set of time-series data using "statistical independency" of each component. We propose applying ICA for extracting gravitational wave (GW) signals. We show several tests using injected signals, and show that this method can be applied to events for signal-to-noise over 15. We then demonstrate the method to actual O1-O3 events, and the identification of the arrival time can be estimated more precisely than that was previously reported.

## 7. Emerging black hole shadow from collapsing boson star

**Authors:** Yu-Peng Zhang, Shao-Wen Wei, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14159v1)

**Summary:**

Shadow forms instantaneously when ignoring the time delay of light propagation. Shadow first appears as a minute dot in the lensing center, then gradually grows as the black hole grows, eventually expanding the inner region of the light-ring. During the quasi-stable phases of boson star and black hole, lensing and shadow structures are nearly identical and remain almost unchanged. Findings reveal potential observed phenomena near the collapsing star and the event horizon of the newly formed black hole in dynamical spacetime.

## 8. Probing single-field inflation: predictions, constraints, and   theoretical viewpoints

**Authors:** Fereshteh Felegary, Thammarong Eadkhong, Farruh Atamurotov, Phongpichit Channuie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14147v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14147v1)

**Summary:**

A coupling term exists between canonical Lagrangian and the potential. This coupling term has many effects on key inflationary parameters. The model provides a promising alternative to the early universe dynamics while aligning with recent cosmological observations, say the authors. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of the Universe and the Planck Collaboration, which is published by the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy and Space Research, in association with BICEP/Keck.

## 9. Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology

**Authors:** Abhinandan Ravi, T. R. Govindarajan, Surajit Kalita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13904v1)

**Summary:**

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators. A statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous S Ne Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ias as standard candles.

## 10. Semiclassical Rotating AdS Black Holes with Quantum Hair in Holography

**Authors:** Ryusei Hamaki, Kengo Maeda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13840v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of the AdS/CFT duality, we study semiclassical stationary rotating AdS black holes with non-trivial quantum hair in three and five dimensions. We construct these solutions by perturbing the BTZ black hole and the five-dimensional Myers-Perry AdSBlack hole. In the three-dimensional case, the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor diverges along a radial null geodesic as the affine parameter approaches zero at the Cauchy horizon.
