## 0. Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in   gravitational-wave astronomy

**Authors:** Michele Mancarella, Davide Gerosa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156v1)

**Summary:**

We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities.

## 1. The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon   curvature perturbations at one loop

**Authors:** Keisuke Inomata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112v1)

**Summary:**

Recently, papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one.loop power spectrum of superHorizon curvatures. In the comoving gauge, we show that these contributions play an important role in the cancellation.

## 2. Exploring lensing signatures through spectrotemporal correlations:   implications for black hole parameter estimation

**Authors:** Sreehari Harikesh, Shahar Hadar, Doron Chelouche

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12053v1)

**Summary:**

Extreme gravitational lensing and relativistic frequency shifts imply that radiation emitted from a black hole's vicinity can echo at different frequencies and times. If such correlations are uncovered by future observations, they could provide a probe of the spacetime geometry in the strong-field region near black holes. We numerically compute the two-point correlation function of specific flux fluctuations in a simple model of line emission by a hotspot in an equatorial circular orbit. Our results for the correlation maps show a clear decomposition into direct emission-dominated, and lensing-dominated contributions.

## 3. Novel Brans-Dicke Wormhole Solutions in Non-Vacuum Spacetimes

**Authors:** Amir Hadi Ziaie, Naser Sadeghnezhad, Akbar Jahan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12043v1)

**Summary:**

In the present study we search for a new class of wormhole solutions in the framework of Brans-Dicke (BD) theory in the presence of anisotropic matter distribution. We find exact static spherically symmetric solutions to the BD field equations which represent wormhole configurations. The regularity of the obtained solutions is verified by calculating the Kretschmann scalar in order to ensure that curvature singularities are absent in the wormhole spacetime. We then find that BD wormholes can exist without violating NEC and WEC, either at the throat or across the entire Spacetime.

## 4. The sinusoidal valley: a recipe for high peaks in the scalar and induced   tensor spectra

**Authors:** Aris Katsis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12015v1)

**Summary:**

A sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.

## 5. Quasi-Local Black Hole Horizons: Recent Advances

**Authors:** Abhay Ashtekar, Badri Krishnan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825v1)

**Summary:**

Event horizons are unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum gravity. In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought' only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics. They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen insights. This review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi- local horizons in classical general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.

## 6. SFTs: a scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration   gravitational-wave signals

**Authors:** Rodrigo Tenorio, Davide Gerosa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11823v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11823v1)

**Summary:**

Short-time Fourier Transforms (SFTs) can analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries. Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation ground-based detectors and massive black-hole binaries observed by the LISA space mission. SFTs reduce the computing cost of evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on the specific application, with respect to a standard approach. We present a pilot application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors.

## 7. Gravitational lensing by charged black hole with global monopole in   strong field limit

**Authors:** Yi-Ling Lan, Yun-Feng Qu, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813v1)

**Summary:**

The study looked at gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime. The dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the monopole. The results presented here could be experimentally explored in analogue gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study. The findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopoles on gravitational Lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions.

## 8. Identification of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from Cosmic   String Using Machine Learning

**Authors:** Xianghe Ma, Mengfei Sun, Jin Li, Brendan McCane, Borui Wang, Minghui Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11804v1)

**Summary:**

 cosmic strings play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the fundamental structure and evolution of the universe. The advent and operation of space-based detectors provide an important opportunity for detecting stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. However, the intricate nature of SGWB poses a formidable challenge in distinguishing its signal from the complex noise by some traditional methods. We attempt to identify SGWB based on machine learning. Our findings show that the joint detection of LISA and Taiji significantly outperforms individual detectors, and even in the presence of numerous low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) signals, the identification accuracy remains exceptionally high with 95%.

## 9. Quasinormal modes of massive scalar fields in five-dimensional   Myers-Perry black holes with two arbitrary rotation parameters

**Authors:** Zi-Yang Huang, Jia-Hui Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11764v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the quasinormal modes of massive scalar fields in the background of five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes. We find that all obtained modes have negative imaginary parts and are decaying modes. We also consider the impact of the rotation parameters, scalar field mass $mu$ and azimuthal numbers on the scalar quasin formal modes. Our numerical results also demonstrate the symmetries of the QNMs explicitly. We conclude that we have found the long-living scalar modes.

## 10. Gravitational lensing and accretion disk imaging of a Buchdahl dense   core

**Authors:** Takahisa Igata, Motoki Omamiuda, Yohsuke Takamori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11755v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing and accretion disk imaging characteristics of a dense core modeled by the Buchdahl spacetime. By imposing the appropriate energy conditions and ensuring the absence of curvature singularities, we delineate the parameter space in which the dense core mimics key gravitational features of black holes. We derive the photon orbital equation and calculate deflection angles, clearly distinguishing between weak- and strong-deflection regimes. These findings suggest that the lensing signatures of dense cores can distinguish them from black holes, offering new insights for high-resolution observations.

## 11. Electromagnetic Waves in Cosmological Space-Time II. Luminosity Distance

**Authors:** Denitsa Staicova, Michail Stoilov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11634v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we continue our investigation on how the electromagnetic waves propagate in the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. Unlike the standard approach, which relies on null geodesics and geometric optics approximation, we derive explicit solutions for electromagnetic waves. In particular, our analysis reveals potential modifications to the standard luminosity distance formula. Its effect on other cosmological parameters, e.g., the amount of cold dust matter in the Universe, is considered and estimated from Type Ia supernovae data. We see that this alternative model is able to fit the supernova data.

## 12. Instability of marginally outer trapped surfaces from initial data set   symmetry

**Authors:** Abbas M. Sherif

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11581v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11581v1)

**Summary:**

In this note we present some basic results with regards to the stability of a MOTS. The vector decomposition allows us to characterize the instability of $\mathcal{S}$ by the nature of the normal component to the MOTS and the divergence of the component along the MOT. Further observations are made under the assumption of the Mots having a constant mean curvature, and of the Einstein manifold being an Einstein manifold. We conclude with the conclusion that a MOT with a constant curvature is stable.

## 13. The nature of gravitational wave events with host environment escape   velocities

**Authors:** Guo-Peng Li, Xi-Long Fan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11489v1)

**Summary:**

The method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. It also enables testing general relativity and improves source localization, which the latter is instrumental in multi-messenger astronomy. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars.

## 14. Interference patterns for simple lens models in wave-optics regime

**Authors:** Ashish Kumar Meena

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11488v1)

**Summary:**

This work studies interference patterns created by simple lens models (point mass, Chang-Refsdal, and binary lens) in the wave optics regime. We study how the interference patterns behave close to the caustic curves which mark the high magnification regions in conventional geometric optics. We see that for a source close to caustics, the oscillations in the amplification factor (their amplitude and location of crests and troughs) can differ significantly in wave optics compared to geometric optics, especially at frequencies around 100 Hz.

## 15. Higher-Dimensional Vacuum Einstein Equations: Symmetry, New Solutions,   and Ricci Solitons

**Authors:** M. M. Akbar, M. Self

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11428v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the system of vacuum Einstein equations (i.e., Ricci-flat metrics) with two hypersurface-orthogonal, commuting Killing vector fields in $d \ge 5$ dimensions is invariant under the action of a one-parameter Lie group. The group action on any metric can be expressed in a closed, universal form. This enables the generation of a family of solutions from any given ``seed" solution of the system without solving additional equations. This extends the Lie point symmetry in four dimensions, found earlier for axisymmetric static vacuum systems.

## 16. Generalized quantum two level model and its application in astrophysics

**Authors:** Orkash Amat, Nurimangul Nurmamat, Yong-Feng Huang, Cheng-Ming Li, Jin-Jun Geng, Chen-RanHu, Ze-Cheng Zou, Xiao-Fei Dong, Chen Deng, Fan Xu, Xiao-li Zhang, Chen Du

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11416v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11416v1)

**Summary:**

Complicated time-dependent curved spacetime and electric field are involved in many astrophysical situations. In this Letter, a generalized quantum two-level model (GQTLM) is developed. The model is expected to significantly advance the quantum exploration of the universe. It could refine the prediction of primordial gravitational waves and relevant non-Gaussian signals, extend the calculation of Hawking radiation to general black hole configurations, help to distinguish neutron stars from strange quark stars, and elucidate the gravitational pair production mechanism.

## 17. AdS gravaster and bulk-cone singularities

**Authors:** Heng-Yu Chen, Yasuaki Hikida, Yasutaka Koga

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11403v1)

**Summary:**

The horizon of a black hole is surrounded by the photon sphere. An outside observer cannot easily examine the geometry inside the sphere. In this note, we propose a way to investigate the region from dual conformal field theory. We first construct gravaster geometry as an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime. We then compute numerically the retarded Green function from the bulk theory and observe bulk-cone singularities corresponding to null geodesics traveling into the interior region. We show that it is possible to examine the region inside the photons sphere from bulk- cone singularities of dual conformist theory.

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11328v1)

**Summary:**

TianQin is a future space-based gravitational wave observatory. It will consist of three Earth orbiting satellites on nearly identical orbits with orbital radii of about $10^5$ km. A large variety of gravitational wave sources are expected in this frequency band, including the merger of massive black hole binaries. The TianQin project has been progressing smoothly following the ``0123" technology roadmap. The satellites will form a normal triangle constellation whose plane is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.
