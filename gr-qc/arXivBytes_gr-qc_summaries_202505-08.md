## 0. I-Love-Q Relations of Fermion-Boson Stars

**Authors:** Kelvin Ka-Ho Lam, Lap-Ming Lin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04605v1)

**Summary:**

Fermion-boson stars (FBSs) can be viewed as neutron stars with a bosonic dark matter (DM) admixture. A challenge in studying the impact of DM on neutron stars is the absence of a universally accepted nuclear-matter equation of state (EOS) We study how DM parameters, such as the boson particle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs and explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q relations.

## 1. Local uniqueness of the Black String with small circle size

**Authors:** Emma Albertini, Daniel Platt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04573v1)

**Summary:**

In this article we study uniqueness of the Black String, i.e. the product of 4-dimensional Schwarzschild space with a circle of length L. In arXiv:2410.20967, this was reduced to a non-linear elliptic PDE, and we use this setup to show that for small L the BlackString is infinitesimally rigid as a Ricci-flat metric. Using a fixed point theorem, we prove that this implies local uniqueness.

## 2. Attracting without being attracted: Dark Matter as an aether wind

**Authors:** Raymond Isichei, Joao Magueijo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the possibility that part of what we call dark matter may be the mark of a preferred frame. In the non-relativistic limit this appears as a deviant matter source capable of attracting normal matter, but not feeling the attraction from other forms of matter or from itself. While this implies a violation of momentum conservation, no logical inconsistencies arise in this deviant ''Newtonian'' limit. In contrast, due to Bianchi identities, the relativistic theory must undergo core change.

## 3. Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings without scaling

**Authors:** Kai Schmitz, Tobias Schröder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04537v1)

**Summary:**

Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a previous article [1], we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a population of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff frequency. In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on theGW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. [2].

## 4. Hot Holographic 2-flavor Quark Star

**Authors:** Le-Feng Chen, Jing-Yi Wu, Hao Feng, Tian-Shun Chen, Kilar Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04477v1)

**Summary:**

Quark star cores have been constructed. The mass range of the whole stars spans from $2$ to $17$ solar masses. This result allow them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. We illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.

## 5. The relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production   experiments

**Authors:** Álvaro Álvarez-Domínguez, Álvaro Parra-López

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04473v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04473v1)

**Summary:**

Analog gravity experiments often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the universe. These experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.

## 6. Warming up the Fibres

**Authors:** Dibya Chakraborty, Rudnei O. Ramos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04447v1)

**Summary:**

Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models.

## 7. Topological regular black holes without Cauchy horizon

**Authors:** Marco Calzá, Massimiliano Rinaldi, Sergio Zerbini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04427v1)

**Summary:**

Regular and spherically symmetric black holes that solve the singularity problems of the Schwarzschild solution are phenomenologically viable at large distance. But they usually suffer from the Cauchy horizon instability. To overcome this drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal horizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally symmetric spacetimes. We show that both these black holes can be constructed without Cauy horizons and without curvature singularities, thereby avoiding the mass inflation instability.

## 8. Master Functions of Reissner-Nordstrom Black Hole Perturbations and   Their Darboux Transformation

**Authors:** Hui-Fa Liu, Ding-fang Zeng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04407v1)

**Summary:**

Lenzi and Sopuerta developed a new method to construct master functions for the perturbation of vacuum black holes. They extend this method to black holes coupled with electromagnetic field and cosmological constant. The master functions must be linear combinations of the metric and electromagnetic-potential perturbations, as well as their first-order derivatives. Requiring these master functions satisfy wave equations with yet-to-be-determined effective potentials, we reduce the linearized Einstein-Maxwell system to a set of algebraic-differential constraints.

## 9. In search of an interaction in the dark sector through Gaussian Process   and ANN approaches

**Authors:** Mazaharul Abedin, Guo-Jian Wang, Yin-Zhe Ma, Supriya Pan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04336v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04336v1)

**Summary:**

This article searched for an interaction in the dark sector between a pressure-less dark matter and a dark energy fluid with constant equation of state, $w_{\rm DE}$. For this purpose, the Gaussian Process (GP) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been employed and using the Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon+ from Supernovae Type Ia and their combination we have reconstructed the interaction function. We find that if we start deviating from $w  = -1$ either in the quintessence ($w  > -1), an emergence of dark interaction is observed from both GP and ANN reconstructions.

## 10. The emergence of the relativistic Lagrangian from the non-relativistic   multiplicative Lagrangian

**Authors:** Kittikun Surwuttinack, Suppanat Supanyo, Sikarin Yoo-Kong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04224v1)

**Summary:**

The multiplicative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian introduce an additional parameter that, despite its variation, results in identical equations of motion. By manipulating the parameter and integrating out, the statistical average of the multiplicative lagrangian naturally arises. Astonishingly, from this statistical viewpoint, the relativistic Lagrangians emerge with remarkable elegance. The spacetime of Einstein's theory reveals itself from a statistical perspective through the action associated with themultiplicative Lagrangeian. This suggests that the multiply-based framework offers a profound and beautiful foundation, one that transcends traditional formulations.

## 11. Relativistic structure of a supermassive black hole embedded in the dark   matter halo of NGC 4649 (M60)

**Authors:** Francisco S. N. Lobo, Jorde A. A. Ramos, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60) We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications.

## 12. Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study   with Unruh-DeWitt detectors

**Authors:** Shunichiro Kinoshita, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04086v1)

**Summary:**

Researchers have proposed a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal conditions of an inflationARY universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantumField theory in curved spacetimes.

## 13. Galactic Spacetime Solutions with a Varying Newton's Coupling

**Authors:** Rounak Chakraborty, Sandipan Sengupta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04060v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04060v1)

**Summary:**

We find a new family of galactic metrics corresponding to flat rotation curves at the outer radii. These are vacuum solutions to a gravity theory where the Newton's coupling varies mildly in space. The effective `mass', whose origin is purely geometric, receives a negative non-baryonic contribution. The angle of deflection of a light ray propagating in this geometry is found to be diminished rather than enhanced compared to the Einsteinian bending. These spacetimes are observationally dintinguishable from other geometric or `dark matter' based alternatives invoked to explain mass discrepancies in galaxies.
