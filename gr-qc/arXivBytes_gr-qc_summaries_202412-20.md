## 0. Spatial anisotropies from long wavelength tensor modes

**Authors:** Jorge Noreña, Thiago Pereira, Sean K. Reynolds

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15181v1)

**Summary:**

We study the leading physical effect of superhorizon scalar and tensor fluctuations on a flat adiabatic universe. We show that it is described by one of three Bianchi solutions. We identify modes that are either pure gauge or unsourced, rendering them unobservable. This enables us to derive an effective metric that retains the spatial symmetries of three known Bianchi cosmologies: type I, V, and IX. These correspond to cases where the "curvature" induced by scalar perturbations is zero, negative, or positive.

## 1. Gravitational Waves From Dark Binaries With Finite-Range Dark Forces

**Authors:** Yang Bai, Sida Lu, Nicholas Orlofsky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15158v1)

**Summary:**

This paper calculates the stochastic gravitational wave background from dark binaries with finite-range attractive dark forces. The finiteness of the dark force range can dramatically modify both the initial distributions and evolution histories of the binaries. The generated gravitational wave spectrum is enhanced in the intermediate frequency regime. It exhibits interesting "knee" and "ankle" features, the most common of which is related to the turn on of thedark force mediator radiation. Other such spectral features are related to changes in the binary merger lifetime and the probability distribution for the initial binary separation.

## 2. Phase consistency test to identify type II strongly lensed gravitational   wave signals using a single event

**Authors:** Kelsie Taylor, Derek Davis, Rico K. L. Lo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148v1)

**Summary:**

For gravitationally lensed type II signals, the phase of the dominant (2, 2) mode and the higher order (3, 3) mode is offset by $-\pi/12$. Using this, we develop a test for type II imagery by allowing the phases of the (2,.2) and (3,.3) modes to vary separately. We analyze GW190412 and GW190814 using this parameterization. We use simulated, low mass ratio, precessing signals to show that the test can reproduce the phase offset when detected by three detectors for H-L optimal SNR.

## 3. Supernovae evidence for foundational change to cosmological models

**Authors:** Antonia Seifert, Zachary G. Lane, Marco Galoppo, Ryan Ridden-Harper, David L. Wiltshire

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15143v1)

**Summary:**

We present a new, cosmologically model-independent, statistical analysis of the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae spectroscopic dataset. We use the Tripp equation for supernova standardisation alone, thereby avoiding any potential correlation in the stretch and colour distributions. We compare the standard homogeneous cosmological model, i.e., $\Lambda$CDM, and the timescape cosmology which invokes backreaction of inhomogeneities. These results provide evidence for a need to revisit the foundations of theoretical and observational cosmology.

## 4. On the perturbed Friedmann equations in Newtonian Gauge

**Authors:** Jaume de Haro, Emilio Elizalde, Supriya Pan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15139v1)

**Summary:**

We present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.

## 5. Probing time-dependent scalar wigs with extreme mass ratio inspirals

**Authors:** Matteo Della Rocca, Georgios Antoniou, Leonardo Gualtieri, Andrea Maselli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15131v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the gravitational wave emission from extreme mass ratio inspirals, key targets for the upcoming space-based detector LISA. We consider the scenario where the lighter black hole in the binary is endowed by a long-lived, time-dependent scalar field configuration, known as a scalar wig. We develop a formalism to compute scalar perturbations for extreme mass Ratio inspirals on circular orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. Our computation provides strong indications that in this scenario the presence of the scalarField does not significantly affect the orbital motion and the gravitationalwaveform.

## 6. Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions

**Authors:** Adria Gómez-Valent, Joan Solà Peracaula

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15124v1)

**Summary:**

The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. To alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [43] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y $ behaves as quintessence, like DESI.

## 7. Response of a Kerr black hole to a generic tidal perturbation

**Authors:** Rajendra Prasad Bhatt, Sumanta Chakraborty, Sukanta Bose

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15117v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15117v1)

**Summary:**

Tidal Love numbers (TLNs) are the response of non-extremal as well as extremal Kerr black holes (BHs) to generic tidal perturbations. Our results suggest that the static and dynamical (linear-in-frequency) TLNs vanish for both Schwarzschild and slowly rotating Kerr BHs. The only case where TLNs do not vanish is when they are dynamical and arise in response to non- Extremal and Extremal Kerr perturbation.

## 8. Tests for model misspecification in simulation-based inference: from   local distortions to global model checks

**Authors:** Noemi Anau Montel, James Alvey, Christoph Weniger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15100v1)

**Summary:**

Model misspecification analysis strategies are a key component of scientific model development. There has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation. We provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model missingpecification test for real gravitational wave data.

## 9. Tail effects of self-interacting scalar fields

**Authors:** Philippe Brax, Emma Bruyère

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15092v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the effects of quartic self-interactions on the dynamics of a binary system due to a (nearly) massless scalar field conformally coupled to matter. We investigate the deviations from General Relativity at the conservative level and put a bound on the self-coupling. We also consider the radiative sector where we use the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism to find the tail interactions which couple the multipoles of the binary system and induce a small advance of the periastron.

## 10. Islands, Double Holography, and the Entanglement Membrane

**Authors:** Hanzhi Jiang, Mike Blake, Anthony P. Thompson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15070v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as theEntanglement membrane. We show that the entangler dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglements membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi- classical gravity and a chaotic quantumMany-body system calculation of the Page curve.

## 11. Inflation in non-local hybrid metric-Palatini gravity

**Authors:** Flavio Bombacigno, Mariaveronica De Angelis, Carsten van de Bruck, William Giarè

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15064v1)

**Summary:**

The theory is based on a hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. We incorporate non-localities introduced via the inverse of the d'Alembert operators acting on the scalar curvature. We examine how the non-minimal kinetic couplings between the fields influence the number of e-folds and the field trajectories. To clarify the physical interpretation of our results, we draw analogies with benchmark single-field inflation scenarios that include spectator fields. The study was published in the journal of Theoretical Physics.

## 12. Applications of machine learning in gravitational wave research with   current interferometric detectors

**Authors:** Elena Cuoco, Marco Cavaglià, Ik Siong Heng, David Keitel, Christopher Messenger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15046v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15046v1)

**Summary:**

Machine learning could be useful to optimize instruments like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and future detectors. Algorithms could predict and help in mitigating environmental disturbances in real time, ensuring detectors operate at peak performance. Machine-learning tools for characterizing and cleaning data after it is taken have already become crucial tools for achieving the best sensitivity of the LigO--Virgo--KAGRA network. As the field evolves, the role of machine learning in advancing gravitational-wave research is expected to become increasingly prominent.

## 13. Gravitational quasinormal modes in quadratic gravity

**Authors:** Georgios Antoniou, Leonardo Gualtieri, Paolo Pani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15037v1)

**Summary:**

We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massivespin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same.

## 14. General tradeoff relation of fundamental quantum limits for linear   multiparameter estimation

**Authors:** Guolong Li, Xiao-Ming Lu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15031v1)

**Summary:**

 Linear measurement is an important class of measurements for sensing classical signals including gravitational wave (GW), dark matter, infrared ray, rotation rate, etc. In this Letter, we establish a general tradeoff relation that tightly constrains the fundamental quantum limits of two independent parameters in a monochromatic classical signal detected by any linear quantum device. This result is related to many applications, particularly detuned GW sensors for searching post-merger remnants due to the direct relation between the detuned frequency and incompatible coefficient.

## 15. Field-dependent diffeomorphisms and the transformation of surface   charges between gauges

**Authors:** Luca Ciambelli, Marc Geiller

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14992v1)

**Summary:**

Weyl charge vanishes in the Bondi-Sachs gauge but not in the Fefferman-Graham gauge. This indicates that the gauge-dependent Weyl charge differs fundamentally from charges like mass and angular momentum. This interpretation is reinforced by two key observations: the Weyl conformal factor does not satisfy any flux-balance law, and the associated charge arises from a corner term in the symplectic structure. These properties justify assigning the Wey charge a kinematical status.

## 17. Optimal design of interpolation methods for time-delay interferometry

**Authors:** Martin Staab, Jean-Baptiste Bayle, Olaf Hartwig, Aurélien Hees, Marc Lilley, Graham Woan, Peter Wolf

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14884v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14884v1)

**Summary:**

Time-delay interferometry (TDI) suppresses laser frequency noise by forming linear combinations of time-shifted interferometric measurements. To enable in-band laser noise reduction by eight to nine orders of magnitude, interpolation has to be performed with high accuracy. Previous research suggested Lagrange interpolation as the interpolation method for TDI. Its transfer function performs well at low frequency but requires a high number of coefficients. The reduction from 42 to 22 coefficients enables us to save computational cost and increases robustness against artefacts in the data.

## 18. Harmonic spectrum of pulsar timing array angular correlations

**Authors:** Bruce Allen, Joseph D. Romano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14852v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14852v1)

**Summary:**

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) detect gravitational waves (GWs) via the correlations they create in the arrival times of pulses from different pulsars. The mean correlation, a function of the angle between the directions to two pulsars, was predicted in 1983 by Hellings and Downs (HD) Observation of this angular pattern is crucial evidence that GWs are present. PTAs "reconstruct the HD curve" by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs separated by similar angles.

## 19. Tidal Love numbers and quasi-normal modes of the Schwarzschild-Hernquist   black hole

**Authors:** Sumanta Chakraborty, Geoffrey Compère, Ludovico Machet

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14831v1)

**Summary:**

We derive the model of the Schwarzschild black hole immersed into a dark matter halo with a relativistic Hernquist profile. We develop a stable numerical scheme for computing tidal Love numbers based on asymptotic series expansions. We establish that the quasi-normal modes admit qualitatively distinct scaling laws in terms of dark matter densities. We further comment upon the existence of matter configurations obeying the dominant energy condition that lead to multiple light rings. We conclude that two distinct choices of matter perturbations lead to distinct spectra.

## 20. New Modes for Vector Bosons in the Static Patch

**Authors:** Adel A. Rahman, Leonard Susskind

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14749v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a massive vector Boson in a static patch of $D$-dimensional de Sitter space (dS$_D$). We argue that this field is controlled by an effective physical (squared) mass. In $D = 3$ spacetime dimensions, the $s$-wave sector of our theory remarkably simplifies. We conjecture that the theory remains well-defined in the naively tachyonic Lagrangian mass range of $-2(D-1) < 0.

## 21. Running Einstein Constant and the Vacuum Energy Problem

**Authors:** Giovanni Montani, Giulia Maniccia, Elisa Fazzari, Alessandro Melchiorri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14747v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a revised formulation of General Relativity for cosmological contexts. The Einstein constant varies with the energy density of the Universe. We demonstrate that this modification has no direct phenomenological impact on the Universe's dynamics or on particle motion within the expanding cosmos. Our findings indicate that the current value of the vacuum energy is consistent with zero. The expansion used in our formulation would no longer be valid if the current state significantly deviates from the assumed near-vacuum condition. Implications of the modified $CDM model with respect to the Hubble tension are also discussed.

## 22. Relational Observables in Group Field Theory

**Authors:** Luca Marchetti, Edward Wilson-Ewing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14622v1)

**Summary:**

We construct relational observables in group field theory (GFT) in terms of positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) We focus on matter quantum reference frames; this can be generalized to other types of frames within the same POVM-based framework. We find that our quantum reference frame-based relational observable overcome the intrinsic limitations of previous proposals while reproducing the same continuum limit results concerning expectation values of the number and volume operators on coherent states. There can be important differences for more complex operators, as well as for othertype GFT states.

## 23. Nonlinear Dynamics of the Inner Horizon in Reissner-Nordström Black   Holes: Insights into Mass Inflation

**Authors:** Nihar Ranjan Ghosh, Malay K. Nandy

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14618v1)

**Summary:**

The inner horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole moves inward in the course of mass inflation. Higher the mass of the scalar field, faster are the shrinking rate of the inner horizon and the rate of massflation. Our solution for dynamic shrinking of the Inner horizon suggests that a ReISSner- Nordstr \"om spacetime tends towards a Schwarzschild-like geometry. We model this phenomenon with a massive chargeless scalarField minimally coupled with the Reissnersnordstr\'om Spacetime.

## 24. Revisiting Einstein's analogy: black holes as gradient-index lenses

**Authors:** J. E. Gómez-Correa, E. Espíndola-Ramos, O. López-Cruz, S. Chávez-Cerda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14609v1)

**Summary:**

According to Albert Einstein, gravitation is analogous to an optical medium. Various definitions of the gradient-index (GRIN) medium representing curved spacetime have been proposed. This paper introduces a novel approach for generating the form of GRIN media that reproduces the behavior of light in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole or about the equatorial spacetime of a Kerr black hole. Our approach is based on Noether's theorem that leads to optical Fermat's principle, leveraging the system's symmetry.

## 25. An analytical joint prior for effective spins for inference on the spin   distribution of binary black holes

**Authors:** Masaki Iwaya, Kazuya Kobayashi, Soichiro Morisaki, Kenta Hotokezaka, Tomoya Kinugawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14551v1)

**Summary:**

We derive an analytical form of the joint prior of effective spin parameters. We assume an isotropic and uniform-in-magnitude spin distribution. This is a vital factor in performing hierarchical Bayesian inference. We reanalyze binary black holes in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. While the results are largely unchanged, log-likelihood errors due to the use of the inaccurate prior evaluations are $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

## 26. Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes

**Authors:** Goncalo Araujo-Regado, Philipp A. Hoehn, Francesco Sartini, Bilyana Tomova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548v1)

**Summary:**

Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Here, we show that there is an arguably more interesting relationship. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical reference frames for dressing subregion variables. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We anticipate that core insights extend to Yang-Mills theory andgravity.
