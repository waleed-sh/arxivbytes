## 0. Measuring spin precession from massive black holes binaries with   gravitational waves: insights from time-domain signal morphology

**Authors:** Simona J. Miller, Maximiliano Isi, Katerina Chatziioannou, Vijay Varma, Sophie Hourihane

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14573v1)

**Summary:**

Robustly measuring binary black hole spins via gravitational waves is key to understanding these systems' astrophysical origins. This remains challenging -- especially for high-mass systems, whose signals are short and dominated by the merger. Nonetheless, events like GW190521 show that strong spin precession can indeed be gleaned from high-Mass systems. In this work, we track howspin precession imprints on simulated high- mass binary black holes signals cycle-by-cycle using time-domain inference.

## 1. Light deflection in unified gravity and measurable deviation from   general relativity

**Authors:** Mikko Partanen, Jukka Tulkki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14446v1)

**Summary:**

Light, though massless, does not travel in a perfectly straight line when it passes near a massive object. Instead, it follows the curvature of spacetime - a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, occurs because massive bodies like stars, galaxies, or black holes distort the fabric of Spacetime around them, bending the path of light much like a lens bends rays in optics. The theory of unified gravity can be used to calculate the curved metric of locally measurable spacetime and to obtain the observable deflection of light near astrophysical objects.

## 2. Strings and near-extremal black holes in theories with large   $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry

**Authors:** Sameer Murthy, Mukund Rangamani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14380v1)

**Summary:**

We study the one-loop partition function of superstrings in the $AdS_3$ background. We show that the supergravity spectrum, which contains non-chiral primary states, can be recovered by this partition function in the semiclassical limit. We also show how the boundary currents are encoded in the string spectrum. Finally, we comment on the limit when the AdS curvature radius is string scale, which is directly accessible within the RNS formalism for this compactification.

## 3. Duality and four-dimensional black holes: gravitational waves,   algebraically special solutions, pole skipping, and the spectral duality   relation in holographic thermal CFTs

**Authors:** Sašo Grozdanov, Mile Vrbica

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14229v1)

**Summary:**

The physics of gravitational waves and other classical fields on specifically four-dimensional backgrounds of black holes exhibits electric-magnetic-like dualities. In this paper, we discuss the structure of such dualities in terms of geometrical quantities with a physically-intuitive interpretation. We then use these results and apply them to the holographic study of three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) The dualities enforce the recently-developed spectral duality relation along with a multitude of implications for the physics of thermal CFTs.

## 4. Bispectrum from five-dimensional inflation

**Authors:** Ignatios Antoniadis, Auttakit Chatrabhuti, Jules Cunat, Hiroshi Isono

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14225v1)

**Summary:**

Five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal. 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times.

## 5. A Hubble constant estimation with dark standard sirens and galaxy   cluster catalogues

**Authors:** Freija Beirnaert, Archisman Ghosh, Gergely Dálya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14077v1)

**Summary:**

We adapt the cosmology inference pipeline gwcosmo to handle galaxy cluster catalogues. We use galaxy cluster data from the PSZ2 and the eRASS catalogues to provide redshift support for a gravitational-wave dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0. This paves the way towards precise and accurate cosmography making use of distant compact binary mergers from upcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network.

## 6. The Constraints on the SGWB from Cosmic Strings by a HFGW   Electromagnetic Resonance System

**Authors:** Jin Li, Meijin Li, Nan Yang, Li Wang, Hao Yu, Yingzhou Huang, Kai Lin, Zi-Chao Lin, Fangyu Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13891v1)

**Summary:**

The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the early universe's formation and evolution. Studies indicate that the SGWB spectrum from cosmic strings can span an extraordinarily broad frequency range, extending from extremely low frequencies up to the microwave band. This work specifically investigates the detectability of cosmic string SGWB signals in an electromagnetic (EM) resonance system at GHz frequency. These findings would complement existing multi-band SGWB observations and provide additional constraints on cosmic-string tension parameters in GHz frequency regimes.

## 7. AdS Black String in a Cosmic Web: Geodesics, Shadows, and Thermodynamics

**Authors:** Faizuddin Ahmed, Ahmad Al-Badawi, Izzet Sakallı

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13833v1)

**Summary:**

We present a comprehensive analysis of cylindrically symmetric AdS BSs surrounded by CS and QF. We demonstrate that the presence of CS reduces the radius of circular photon orbits (CPO) and BH shadow size. We find that time-like particle orbits show increased energy with higher $\alpha$ and $c$ values. These results have potential observational implications for gravitational lensing, accretion disk dynamics, and BS evaporation signatures in future astronomical observations, we say.
