## 0. The Starobinsky model of inflation and Renormalizability

**Authors:** Roberto Percacci, Gian Paolo Vacca

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13931v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13931v1)

**Summary:**

The Starobinsky model was born in a cosmological scenario where conformally coupled matter quantum field fluctuations on the vacuum drive a semiclassical energy momentum tensor quadratic in curvature. The presence of an unstable de Sitter solution contributed to spread the idea that the early universe could have experienced an inflationary epoch. Effective "$R + R^2$" models of gravity have later gained much attention since their predictions are in very good agreement with the measurements of CMB data.

## 1. Thermodynamic Topological Classes of Family of Black Holes with   NUT-Charge

**Authors:** Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou, Muhammad Rizwan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13914v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13914v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce new analytical methods for treating black-hole thermodynamic topology, and thus depart from the usual treatment known in the literature. As application we investigate the universal thermodynamicTopological classes of a family of black holes with NUT-charge. We also investigate the thermodynamic Topological Classes of a Family of Black Holes With NUT Charge. We conclude that black holes can be thought of as being in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium with an NUT charge. We call this state of affairs the "black hole state of equilibrium"

## 2. Isometries of spacetimes without observer horizons

**Authors:** Leonardo García-Heveling, Abdelghani Zeghib

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13904v1)

**Summary:**

We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometric group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $Z or $R.

## 3. Violation of Bell inequalities from Cosmic Microwave Background data

**Authors:** Roberto Dale, Jesús M. Gandía, Juan Antonio Morales-Lladosa, Ramon Lapiedra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13846v1)

**Summary:**

A cosmic-like Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality was proved for the temperature fluctuations of the perturbed Cosmic Microwave Background. This inequality can be tested from observational data. In fact, no violation for it has been found from the CMB data provided by the COBE satellite in different sky directions. This is a result which, being negative, is not conclusive in relation to the possible violation of the CHSH inequality in a cosmological context. So, the preceding analysis needs to be extended by using more precise current C MB data, like those provided by WMAP and Planck satellites.

## 4. Compact objects with scalar charge imbedded in a magnetic or electric   field in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories

**Authors:** Olivier Minazzoli, Maxime Wavasseur

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13829v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we generalize the Schwarzschild-Melvin solution within Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories to include non-null scalar charges, while remaining embedded in a magnetic or electric field. We then use this general solution to obtain the solution in the specific case of Entangled Relativity after a conformal transformation. This notably enables us to verify that the analytical solution used in [Arruga & Minazzoli 2021] in order to represent compact objects such as neutron stars in Entangledrelativity is indeed a good approximation.

## 5. Misner-Sharp Energy and P-V Criticality in Quasi-Topological Cosmology

**Authors:** Yue Chu, Shi-Bei Kong, Yang Liu, Hongsheng Zhang, Ya-Peng Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13782v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13782v1)

**Summary:**

We present a sound foundation of thermodynamics for a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe from the first principle. The unified first law requires extra terms for generalized force and conjugate generalized position, which are identified as thermodynamic pressure and thermodynamic volume. We calculate the critical exponents for the phase transition, which may be beneficial to probe the micro theory of quasi-topology gravity. We show that the FRW universe undergoes $P$-$V$ phase transitions.

## 6. Astrophysical signals from the neighboring brane

**Authors:** Sergey G. Rubin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13761v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13761v1)

**Summary:**

The electromagnetic field is uniformly distributed over the extra dimensions, preserving charge universality in 4D physics. It is shown that the particles on different branes interact by exchanging photons and gravitons, which could explain the phenomena such as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and dark matter. The latter consists of heavy electrons that are located on a brane free of the observers. The hierarchy of the energy scales and the subsequent fine-tuning can be achieved for the brane populated by observers.

## 7. Effect of kick velocity on gravitational wave detection of binary black   holes with space- and ground-based detectors

**Authors:** Jie Wu, Mengfei Sun, Xianghe Ma, Xiaolin Liu, Jin Li, Zhoujian Cao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13710v1)

**Summary:**

Asymmetric gravitational wave (GW) emission imparts a kick velocity to the remnant black hole, affecting observed waveforms and parameter estimation. For space-based detectors, nearly 50% of detected signals require corrections, while for ground-based detector, this fraction is below one-third. For Q3d population model, space- based detectors could observe kick effects in over 60% of massive BBH mergers, while in pop3 model this fraction could drop to 3$\sim$4%.

## 8. Dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls with bias directions

**Authors:** Yuan-Jie Li, Jing Liu, Zong-Kuan Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13644v1)

**Summary:**

The spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry can lead to the formation of domain walls in the early Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of bias directions on the dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls, mainly focusing on the $N = 3$ model with a biased potential. Our results indicate that the annihilation time depends not only on the vacuum energy difference $delta V$ but also on bias directions described by the relative potential difference $ \zeta $. We find notable differences in the dynamics in the model due to bias directions.

## 9. Regular Schwarzschild black holes and cosmological models

**Authors:** Roberto Casadio, Alexander Kamenshchik, Jorge Ovalle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13627v1)

**Summary:**

We study regular Schwarzschild black holes in General Relativity as an alternative to the singular counterpart. We analyze two types of solutions which are completely parameterised by the ADM mass alone. Both families of regular solutions contain a de Sitter condensate at the core and admit (quasi) extremal black hole configurations. Cosmological models based on these regular configurations are also analyzed, finding that they describe non-trivial Kantowski-Sachs universes free of singularities.

## 10. Algebraic and Positive Geometry of the Universe: from Particles to   Galaxies

**Authors:** Claudia Fevola, Anna-Laura Sattelberger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13582v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13582v1)

**Summary:**

In recent years, the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics with particle physics and cosmology has led to significant advances. Central to this progress is the twofold formulation of the study of particle interactions and observables in the universe. This article introduces key developments, mathematical tools, and the connections that drive progress at the frontier between algebraic geometry, the theory of $D$- modules, and physics. All these threads contribute to shaping the flourishing field of positive geometry, which aims to establish a unifying mathematical language for describing phenomena in cosmology and particle physics.

## 11. Near-extremal dumb holes and some aspects of the Hawking effect

**Authors:** Akshat Pandey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13557v1)

**Summary:**

We propose novel non-relativistic fluid analogue models, that is dumb hole models, for extremal and near-extremal black holes. Further we study the back-reaction effects of analogue Hawking radiation emitted from these dumb holes. We speculate on the existence of an emergent Hawking force which leads to the reduction in the background fluid velocity and which is produced as a consequence of phonon emission. In addition to the analogue gravity literature, our results might be of relevance to black hole pedagogy.

## 12. Quasinormal Modes, Grebody Factors, and Hawking Radiation Sparsity of   Black Holes Influenced by a Global Monopole Charge in Kalb-Ramond Gravity

**Authors:** Anshuman Baruah, Yassine Sekhmani, Sunil Kumar Maurya, Atri Deshamukhya, Mahmood Khalid Jasim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13496v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13496v1)

**Summary:**

Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity is an intriguing model incorporating local Lorentz violation, and black hole (BH) solutions are known to exist. In this study, we investigate some crucial aspects of BHs endowed with a global monopole charge in the self-interacting KR field. We study the quasinormal modes corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations; derive rigorous bounds for the greybody factors (GBFs); and examine the sparsity of Hawking radiation.

## 13. Extra-Dimensional de Broglie-Bohm Quantum Cosmology

**Authors:** F. A. P. Alves-Júnior, A. S. Lemos, F. A. Brito

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13402v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we explore the de Broglie-Bohm Quantum Cosmology for a stiff matter, $p = \rho$, anisotropic n-dimensional Universe. We find two distinct configurations for the dynamics of the extra dimensions. The first configuration features larger extra dimensions at the bounce, which subsequently undergo compactification to a smaller size. In contrast, the second configuration exhibits a smaller extra dimension at the bounced, evolving toward a larger, finite, and stabilized value. We also address the particular five-dimensional case where the Wheeler-DeWitt equation degenerates.

## 14. Thermodynamic analysis and shadow bound of black holes surrounded by a   dark matter halo

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13397v1)

**Summary:**

We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a black hole (BH) immersed in a dark matter halo (DMH) We use the Newtonian Helmholtz free energy to show that there is no phase transition to other BH with positive heat capacity surrounded by a DMH. We investigate the shadow bound of favored region for the BH immersed in the DMH by introducing three critical impact parameters. The Newtonian ($1/a_0$) approximation gives us a correct thermodynamic description of BH surrounded by DMH because first law of thermodynamics and Smarr formula are satisfied.
