## 0. An Effective Theory for Higgs Inflation

**Authors:** A. Tronconi, G. Venturi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06197v1)

**Summary:**

The generation of large curvature perturbations associated with the production of primordial black holes is studied in the context of a Higgs inflaton. To enable this amplification, we consider an inflationary model in which the tree-level action for gravity and the Standard Model Higgs is modified by quantum corrections. Finally within a minimal EFT framework, we present two viable models in which this perturbation can lead to the formation of black holes in the asteroid mass range, potentially accounting for the entirety of dark matter.

## 1. Revealing the nature of ultra-long period objects with space-based   gravitational-wave interferometers

**Authors:** Arthur G. Suvorov, Clara Dehman, José A. Pons

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06125v1)

**Summary:**

A few members of the recently-discovered class of ultra-long period objects have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars remain a viable candidate. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit though -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37 -- several of these elusive radio transients should be gravitational-wave bright. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature.

## 2. Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in   D-foamy space-times

**Authors:** Chengyi Li, Bo-Qiang Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121v1)

**Summary:**

The absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated. We show that these constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from supercritical string theory. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases that charged quanta such as electrons do not radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.

## 3. Fermionic quantum cosmology as a framework for resolving type IV   singularities

**Authors:** Paweł Kucharski, Adam Balcerzak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06103v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06103v1)

**Summary:**

Fermionic degrees of freedom are effectively incorporated into a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with a scalar field. The elimination of non-physical, divergent solutions results in a quantum regularization of the classical singularity. These results indicate the potential of fermionic models in quantum cosmology for mitigating the singularity problem. The study was published in the Journal of Physics and Astronomy, a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Institute of Physics.

## 4. Black holes as gravitational mirrors

**Authors:** L. C. N. Santos, F. M. da Silva, C. R. Muniz, V. B. Bezerra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06018v1)

**Summary:**

Retrolensing is a gravitational lensing effect in which light emitted by a background source is deflected by a black hole and redirected toward the observer. In this context, we explore the possibility of seeing objects of the solar system in past eras through telescope observations by using black holes as a gravitational mirror. For the first time in the literature, we propose the study of the returning photons of planets instead of stars in retrolensing geometry. The supermassive Sgr A* black hole at the galactic center and a nearby stellar black hole are explored.

## 5. Galactic double neutron stars as dual-line gravitational-wave sources:   Prospects with LISA and Cosmic Explorer

**Authors:** Wen-Fan Feng, Lijing Shao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05900v1)

**Summary:**

Double neutron star (DNS) systems could serve as intriguing dual-line gravitational-wave (GW) sources. We estimate that 6 (22) spinning NS components could be detected by the next-generation ground-based GW detector, Cosmic Explorer. The median signal-to-noise ratio achievable with Cosmic Explorer is approximately 20--30. Through the dual- line GW detection strategy, the relative measurement accuracy of the NS moment of inertia is estimated to be $8\sim 8\%$.

## 6. Screening Mechanisms on White Dwarfs: Symmetron & Dilaton

**Authors:** J. Bachs-Esteban, I. Lopes, J. Rubio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05871v1)

**Summary:**

This work provides the first comparison of the symmetron and dilaton fields in white dwarfs. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarFS, leading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon models, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars. These findings highlight both phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these mechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmETron and Dilaton parameter spaces. The mass-radius deviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model parameters.

## 7. Dirac stars with wormhole topology

**Authors:** Vladimir Dzhunushaliev, Vladimir Folomeev, Sayabek Sakhiyev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05818v1)

**Summary:**

We consider configurations consisting of a gravitating nonlinear spinor field and a massless ghost scalar field providing a nontrivial spacetime topology. For such a mixed system, we have constructed families of asymptotically flat asymmetric solutions describing Dirac stars. The physical properties of such systems are completely determined by the values of three input quantities: the nonlinearity parameter, the spinor frequency, and the throat parameter. Depending on the specific values of these parameters, the configurations may be regular or singular and possess one or two throats.

## 8. Topological Origin of Horizon Temperature via the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet   Theorem

**Authors:** Jack C. M. Hughes, Fedor V. Kusmartsev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05814v1)

**Summary:**

This paper establishes a connection between the Hawking temperature of spacetime horizons and global topological invariants. This is demonstrated for both de Sitter and Schwarzschild, where the compactification of the near-horizon geometry allows for a direct application of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem. This establishes that spacetime thermodynamics are a consequence of the geometrical structure of Spacetime itself. It also suggests a deep connection between global topology and semi-classical analysis.

## 9. Electromagnetic plasma waves in Big Bounce and Big Crunch cosmologies

**Authors:** Felipe A. Asenjo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05718v1)

**Summary:**

We study the exact dynamics of electromagnetic waves in cold electron-positron plasma in the simplest background of Big Bounce and Big Crunch cosmologies. We show that these waves are described by a Mathieu equation in a Big Bounce cosmology, which opens the possibility of electromagnetic wave amplification due to the cosmological constant in this Universe. In a Big Crunchcosmology, electromagnetic plasma waves are description by a modifiedMathieu equation. In both cases, the features (grow/collapse) of the Universes imprint similar characteristics in the temporal evolution of these waves.

## 10. Periodic Kerr solution as an infinite soliton chain

**Authors:** Dmitry Korotkin, Javier Peraza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05698v1)

**Summary:**

The periodic analog of the Schwarzschild solution is known to be regular and exhibit Kasner asymptotic behaviour for an arbitrary size of event horizon not exceeding the period. We apply an efficient numerical approach based on the inverse scattering method, interpreting the periodic Kerr solution as an infinite chain of solitons. This allows to completely describe the existence domain in the space of physical parameters (the period, mass and the angular momentum) We study the dependence of Kasner exponent and the shape of the ergosphere on parameters of the problem.
