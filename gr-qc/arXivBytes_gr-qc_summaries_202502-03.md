## 0. Spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole   in the galactic center

**Authors:** Mridupawan Deka, Maxim Dvornikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19404v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19404v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk which can co-rotate and counter-rotated with respect to BH. Spin precession of Neutrinos is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysics.

## 1. MHV leaf amplitudes from parafermions

**Authors:** Laura Donnay, Gaston Giribet, Beniamino Valsesia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19332v1)

**Summary:**

We give a dual CFT representation of MHV leaf amplitudes in the large $N$ and semiclassical limit in terms of non-compact parafermions and a single affine Kac-Moody current for $SO(N)$. This representation is consistent with the other 2D CFT realization of 4D leaf Amplitudes proposed in the literature. The equivalence between the two CFT descriptions arises from the $H_3^+$ WZW-Liouville correspondence, applied to the $SL(2) coset theory in the spectrally flowed sector.

## 2. Information Metrics and Possible Limitations of Local Information   Objectivity in Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** Per Berglund, Andrew Geraci, Tristan Hubsch, David Mattingly, Djordje Minic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19269v1)

**Summary:**

 quantum gravity typically violates some of the Cencov assumptions, allowing the Fisher metric and Born rule to vary between observers. We explain these violations, some possible experimental tests, and a new quantum gravity approach based on generally covariant information geometry. We also propose a new type of quantum gravity, based on a more general type of information geometry than the one used in quantum gravity. We conclude that quantum gravity is not a fully-fledged theory, but rather a theory of a type of theory.

## 3. Resumming Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian gravitational waveform   expansions

**Authors:** Andrea Cipriani, Giorgio Di Russo, Francesco Fucito, José Francisco Morales, Hasmik Poghosyan, Rubik Poghossian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19257v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational waveform emitted by a particle moving in a Schwarzschild geometry can be computed, in perturbation theory, as a double series expansion. For scattering processes they describe complementary regions of spacetime. In this paper, we derive all order formulae for those two expansions of the waveform, where the entire dependence on the $y$ or $z$ variables is resummed under the assumption. The results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the confluent Heun functions.

## 4. Temperature-redshift relation in energy-momentum-powered gravity models

**Authors:** C. J. A. P. Martins, A. M. M. Vieira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19177v1)

**Summary:**

There has been recent interest in the cosmological consequences of energy-momentum-powered gravity models. We show that these models violate the temperature-redshift relation, and are therefore further constrained by astrophysical measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature. By breaking degeneracies between this parameter and the matter density, constraints on the latter are also improved by a factor of about two. We provide joint constraints on these models from the combination of astrophysical and backgroundcosmological data. We also show that this power is constrained to be about $|n|<0.01$ and $ |n| <0.1$ respectively in models without and with a cosmologically constant.

## 5. Dark Matter and Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity

**Authors:** H. R. Fazlollahi, H. Velten, H. Shojaie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19141v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19141v1)

**Summary:**

The energy-momentum squared modified theory of gravity aims to account for dark matter effects on galactic scales. We analyze the model near general relativity solutions for spherically symmetric and static metrics. By fixing the components using the rotational velocities of galaxies, the model demonstrates the emergence of a flat rotation curve in the galactic halo. Additionally, we investigate the proposed model's predictions for the light deflection angle and radar echo delay. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 6. Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary   mergers

**Authors:** Yong Gao, Kota Hayashi, Kenta Kiuchi, Alan Tsz-Lok Lam, Hao-Jui Kuan, Masaru Shibata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053v1)

**Summary:**

We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger. Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. We observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode after the merger, but we also find that the growth of the mode amplitude may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation.

## 7. Testing quantum gravity with dilute dipolar Bose gases

**Authors:** Asma Tahar Taiba, Abdelaali Boudjemaa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19044v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum gravity can affect the ground-state properties of dilute homogeneous dipolar Bose gases. We calculate quantum gravity corrections to the condensed fraction, the equation of state, the critical temperature and the superfluid fraction. Improved upper bounds on the generalized uncertainty principle parameters are found. We compare our predictions with previous experimental and theoretical results. The results are published in the open-access journal, Theoretical Astrophysics.

## 8. On the unexpected geometrical origin of the algebra of symmetries

**Authors:** O. Ramírez, Y. Bonder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18829v1)

**Summary:**

The commutator of these symmetries forms a closed, field-independent algebra. This work uncovers a natural correspondence between this algebra and the Lie bracket of some vector fields on the principal fiber bundle associated with the physical theory. We demonstrate that the symmetry algebra is independent of the connection. Finally, we analyze an example illustrating how a specific connection, associated with Lorentz-Lie transformations, simplifies the symmetrygebra in the presence of spacetime Killing vector fields..
