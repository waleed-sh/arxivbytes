## 0. Testing $γδ$CDM Model in the Redshift Bins

**Authors:** Furkan Şakir Dilsiz, Cemsinan Deliduman, Selinay Sude Binici

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07538v1)

**Summary:**

The Hubble crisis is the discrepancy in the values of the Hubble constant inferred from diverse observations in the late and early Universe. Instead of resolution, the conflict is getting larger with further late-time observations. A fundamental constant should be and remain constant throughout the cosmological history and thus at all redshifts. The fact that it turns out to be a function of redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model points out that either there is a problem with the current model, or there are unknown systematics in some of the observations.

## 1. Revisiting black holes of algebraic type D with a cosmological constant

**Authors:** Hryhorii Ovcharenko, Jiri Podolsky, Marco Astorino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07537v1)

**Summary:**

As an extension of our previous work [1] (arXiv:2409.02308), we study a complete family of type D black holes with Kerr-like rotation, NUT twist, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and any value of the cosmological constant. We relate various metric forms of these spacetimes, namely those found by Plebanski-Demianski (PD), Griffiths-Podolsky (GP), and most recently Astorino (A)

## 2. Exploring Temperature Influences on Gravitational Wave Production in   Binary White Dwarfs

**Authors:** Sílvia P. Nunes, José D. V. Arbañil, César H. Lenzi, Jaziel G. Coelho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07501v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates the conditions under which gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted during the merger of hot white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary system. The results indicate that the tidal deformability is more pronounced in stars with higher central temperatures and lower masses, which would lead to reduced emission of GWs. In contrast, more massive stars exhibit less deformability, making them prime candidates for generating strongerGWs. The analysis of frequency and amplitude reveals that the frequencies of high-mass binaries are smaller and evolve more rapidly.

## 3. Exact Dynamical Black Hole Solutions in Five or Higher Dimensions

**Authors:** B. H. Fahim, A. M. Ghezelbash

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07495v1)

**Summary:**

We construct new classes of the dynamical black hole solutions in five or higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. The solutions are non-stationary, and almost conformally regular everywhere. We find three different classes of solutions, based on the values of the coupling constants. We notice that our solutions could be asymptotically de-Sitter, anti-de-Sitters or flat. We also discuss the properties of the solutions, and find the relevant quantities of the Solutions.

## 4. Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Farèse   extension of Brans-Dicke theory

**Authors:** Shammi Tahura, David A. Nichols, Kent Yagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymPTotic evolution equations. These additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences for the scalar field.

## 5. Gravitational Faraday Holonomy

**Authors:** Blake Parvin, Mark Lusk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07483v1)

**Summary:**

Closed optical trajectories in Kerr spacetime are engineered to exhibit a marked lack of symmetry. The eccentricity manifests as a holonomy in gravitational Faraday rotation that can be made arbitrarily large by radial translation of the common location of source and receiver. All trajectories are non-equatorial and include a passage through the equatorial plane at the radial turning point, where the trajectory and pseudo-magnetic field are well-aligned. This, combined with path asymmetry, results in a large gravitationalfaraday holonomy that lends itself to experimental measurement.

## 6. Effect of dark matter halo on transonic accretion flow around a galactic   black hole

**Authors:** Subhankar Patra, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07456v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07456v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the transonic accretion flow in the spacetime of a supermassive black hole (BH) coupled to an anisotropic dark matter fluid. We essentially compare the accretion properties of the Cardoso BH with those of an isolated Schwarzschild BH. The accretion solutions are substantially influenced by the halo parameters when the dark matter distribution is concentrated near the BH horizon. We also observe that various shock properties, such as the shock radius, flow density compression, and temperature compression across the shock fronts are potentially affected by the dark halo.

## 7. Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets   in realistic binary neutron star merger environments

**Authors:** Emma Dreas, Andrea Pavan, Riccardo Ciolfi, Annalisa Celotti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07385v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07385v1)

**Summary:**

The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. For reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in an asymmetrical emerging outflow.

## 8. Radiation eikonal for post-Minkowskian observables

**Authors:** Jung-Wook Kim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07372v1)

**Summary:**

A recent proposal reinterprets the eikonal as the scattering generator, which computes scattering observables through an action as a symmetry generator. The aim of this study is to incorporate dissipative effects from radiation into this framework. The proposed generalisation is tested through several post-Minkowskian scattering observable; scattering waveform, radiated momentum, and (time asymmetric) radiation loss in the impulse. It is hoped that this study will lead to the development of a new type of scattering generator.

## 9. A unified framework for graviton, "partially massless" graviton, and   photon fields in de Sitter spacetime under conformal symmetry

**Authors:** Jean-Pierre Gazeau, Hamed Pejhan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07367v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a conformally invariant (CI) framework in de Sitter (dS) spacetime. This unifies the descriptions of graviton, ``partially massless'' graviton and photon fields. This unification enhances the understanding of fundamental aspects of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds. The framework is grounded in a rigorous group-theoretical analysis in the Wigner sense. It employs Dirac's six-cone formalism and the concept of conformal space. It is based on the field equations for spinor and vector fields in Minkowski spacetime in a manifestly CI form.

## 10. Probing the sign-changeable interaction between dark energy and dark   matter with DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data

**Authors:** Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Yun-He Li, Peng-Ju Wu, Shang-Jie Jin, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07361v1)

**Summary:**

There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign- changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.

## 11. Assessing the systematic errors of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals   waveforms for testing general relativity

**Authors:** Ping Shen, Qiuxin Cui, Wen-Biao Han

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07264v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave (GW) observations from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are powerful tools for testing general relativity (GR) However, systematic errors arising from waveform models could potentially lead to incorrect scientific conclusions. Using Bayesian inference, we investigate the impact of these systematic errors on tests of GR. We emphasize the importance of developing sufficiently accurate waveform templates based on alternative gravity theories for testing GR. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 12. Mass (re)distribution for quantum dust cores of black holes

**Authors:** L. Gallerani, A. Mentrelli, A. Giusti, R. Casadio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07219v1)

**Summary:**

The collective ground state for a spherical symmetric dust ball has been investigated recently in [R. Casadio, Phys. Lett. B 843 (2023) 138055]. In this study, we refine that model by obtaining a mass distribution that accounts for the superposition of wavefunctions across different layers. The new nearly parabolic distribution replaces the linear mass profile of the original work, featuring an overall downward concavity, which leads to a non-vanishing tension.

## 13. The I-Love universal relation for polytropic stars under Newtonian   gravity

**Authors:** Rui Xu, Alejandro Torres-Orjuela, Lars Andersson, Pau Amaro Seoane

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07184v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07184v1)

**Summary:**

The moment of inertia and tidal deformability of idealized stars with polytropic equations of state (EOSs) are numerically calculated under both Newtonian gravity and general relativity. The analysis reveals that the theoretical I-Love universal relation aligns well with the observational data, suggesting that it can serve as an empirical relation. Consequently, it enables the estimation of either the moments of inertia or the tidal deformable of an exoplanet if one of these quantities, along with the mass of the exoplanets, is known.

## 14. On symmetries of gravitational on-shell boundary action at null infinity

**Authors:** Shivam Upadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07136v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the gravitational boundary action at null infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes. We fix the corner ambiguities in the boundary action by using the constraint that (exponential of) the on-shell action leads to tree-level 5-point amplitude in eikonal approximation in a generic supertranslated vacuum. We also show that an infinite tower of soft theorems can be derived from the action if we consider a 'generalization' of the Geroch tensor.

## 15. Shadow of the Scalar Hairy Black Hole with Inverted Higgs Potential

**Authors:** Kok-Geng Lim, Xiao Yan Chew

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07029v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07029v1)

**Summary:**

We study the imaging of a hairy black hole (HBH) in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory. The HBH can evade the no-hair theorem, bifurcate from the Schwarzschild black hole by acquiring some new properties. The size of the shadow and accretion disk increases as the HBH's horizon increases, but the brightness of the rings remains nearly unaffected. This implies our HBH could potentially mimic the Schwarzfeld black hole if we vary the horizon radius.

## 16. State-space algorithm for detecting the nanohertz gravitational wave   background

**Authors:** Tom Kimpson, Andrew Melatos, Joseph O'Leary, Julian B. Carlin, Robin J. Evans, William Moran, Tong Cheunchitra, Wenhao Dong, Liam Dunn, Julian Greentree, Nicholas J. O'Neill, Sofia Suvorova, Kok Hong Thong, Andrés F. Vargas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06990v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06990v1)

**Summary:**

The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be observed in the nanohertz band using a pulsar timing array (PTA) Here a computationally efficient state-space framework is developed for analysing SGWB data. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on synthetic data from the first International PTA Mock Data Challenge. It is shown that the algorithm distinguishes a SGWB from pure noise for $A_{\rm gw} \geq 3 \times 10^{-14}$ s.
