## 0. The quantum Newton's bucket: Active and passive rotations in quantum   theory

**Authors:** Augusto Facundes da Silva, Kayman Jhosef Goncalves, Giorgio Torrieri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21298v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the difference between "active'' and "passive" rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory. We conclude with a look at the implications of our findings for the theory of heavy ion collisions in the quantum world. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 1. Quantum arrival times in free fall

**Authors:** Mathieu Beau, Timothey Szczepanski, Rafael Martellini, Lionel Martellini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21295v1)

**Summary:**

In an application to free-fall, this finding has been used to predict the existence of a mass-dependent positive relative shift with respect to the classical time-of-arrival. We first show that for a Gaussian quantum particle of mass $m$ dropped in a uniform gravitational field $g$, the uncertainties about time and position measurements are related by the relation $ \Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg} $ This novel form of uncertainty relation suggests that choosing the initial state so as to obtain a lower uncertainty in the measured position leads to a higher uncertainty in measured arrival time.

## 2. Quantum information elements in Quantum Gravity states and processes

**Authors:** Daniele Oriti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21234v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum gravity states and processes share a purely combinatorial and algebraic language, and a discrete geometric interpretation. We emphasize how, in this context, entanglement is a seed of topological and geometric properties. A pre-geometric, discrete notion of quantum causality can be implemented, as well as some recent results on the conditions for information transmission and holographic behaviour in quantum gravity states. Together, these features indicate that quantum information concepts and tools play a key role in defining the fundamental structure of quantum spacetime.

## 3. Searching for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string cusps with   the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array third data release

**Authors:** Yong Xia, Jingbo Wang, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Wenming Yan, Yirong Wen, Agastya Kapur, Daniel J. Reardon, Andrew Zic, Jing Zou, Yi Feng, Valentina Di Marco, Saurav Mishra, Christopher J. Russell, Shuangqiang Wang, De Zhao, Xingjiang Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21069v1)

**Summary:**

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) Since GWs are anticipated from cosmic strings, PTAs offer a viable approach to testing their existence. We present the results of the first Bayesian search for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string cusps (GWCS) using the third PPTA data release for 30 millisecond pulsars. In this data collection, we find no evidence for GWCS signals. We find the addition of a CURN with different spectral indices into the noise model has a negligible impact on the upper limits.

## 4. Scalar waves from unbound orbits in a TS spacetime: PN reconstruction of   the field and radiation losses in a self-force approach

**Authors:** G. Di Russo, M. Bianchi, D. Bini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21040v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21040v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze scalar wave emission from unbound orbits in a Topological Star spacetime. Our study uses a self-force approach and leads to a Post-Newtonian reconstruction of the field along the orbit, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. We also compute leading-order radiation losses, namely energy and angular momentum. The study was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.

## 5. Spinning boson stars in nonlinear sigma models and Universal Relations

**Authors:** Christoph Adam, Jorge Castelo Mourelle, Alberto García Martín-Caro, Andrzej Wereszczynski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923v1)

**Summary:**

Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions.

## 6. Constraining Anisotropic Universe Through Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: A   Case Study of The Bianchi Type-I Universe

**Authors:** Jiwon Park, Sourav Mridha, Dukjae Jang, Mayukh R. Gangopadhyay, Myung-Ki Cheoun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20893v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20893v1)

**Summary:**

The isotropy and homogeneity of our Universe are the cardinal principles of modern cosmology. The presence of anisotropy, inhomogeneity, or both are allowed in the metrics defined as the Bianchi type I and V metrics. In this letter, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism, and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on the global an isotropy offered in the Bian Chi type I metrics. This will provide a new path to explore in the background of global anIsotropy.

## 7. Nariai spacetime: orbits, scalar self force and Poynting-Robertson-like   external force

**Authors:** Donato Bini, Giampiero Esposito

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20890v1)

**Summary:**

Nariai solution is studied in spherical and de Sitter coordinates. Two kinds of accelerated motion are investigated in detail. Massless scalar perturbations of Nariai spacetime in absence of sources are worked out. An explicit example out of the black hole context of analytic self-force calculation is obtained. Self-force effects are studied as well, together with some variant of the type of Poynting-Robertson external force, and also building a test electromagnetic field and a test gravitational field.

## 8. Hamiltonian Neural Networks approach to fuzzball geodesics

**Authors:** Andrea Cipriani, Alessandro De Santis, Giorgio Di Russo, Alfredo Grillo, Luca Tabarroni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20881v1)

**Summary:**

Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations, say the researchers. The study looked at planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. The research was published in the open-access journal, Theoretical Physics.

## 9. Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter

**Authors:** Mayank, K. Hari, Subhajit Barman, Dawood Kothawala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874v1)

**Summary:**

The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe with "effective" acceleration $q. However, no such mapping generically exists for theEntanglement between probes. We obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes.

## 10. Causal horizon from quantum fluctuations

**Authors:** Simone Franchini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20714v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a simple model of quantum void where the flow of time is deduced directly from quantum fluctuations and the consequent particle-antiparticle creations. Given a certain number of space-like separated pair creation events, assumed to happen all at the same initial time, we show that past and future can be foliated into a sequence of adapted manifolds based on how many events causally influence them. We also give an explicit construction for the simplest case of one space dimension. For more information, visit: www.quantumvoid.org.

## 11. A MOND model applied to the rotation curve of galaxies

**Authors:** Ana C. M. Ciqueira, Geanderson A. Carvalho, Paulo H. Faccin, Fabrício T. Dalmolin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20599v1)

**Summary:**

A modified Newton dynamics (MOND) model is proposed to study the rotation curves of galaxies. The model is described by an arctangent interpolating function and it fits the rotation curve of several galaxies without invoking the presence of dark matter. It can be further tested in different astrophysical scenarios, such as, the missing mass problem of galaxy clusters and the accelerated expansion of the Universe, thus leading to a more robust and well constrained model. It is also called the acceleration constant once it gives the acceleration scale where Newton's dynamics fails.
