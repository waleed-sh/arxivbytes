## 0. Modified cosmology though spacetime thermodynamics and generalized   mass-to-horizon entropy

**Authors:** Spyros Basilakos, Andreas Lymperis, Maria Petronikolou, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24355v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach for the case of generalized mass-to-horizon entropy. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector arising from the novel terms. We show that the Universe exhibits the usual thermal history with the succession of matter and dark energy epochs. Finally, we perform observational confrontation with Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets, showing that the scenario is in agreement with observations.

## 1. Charges, complex structures, and perturbations of instantons

**Authors:** Lars Andersson, Bernardo Araneda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24265v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational instantons have a quasi-locally conserved charge associated to spin-lowering via Killing spinors. For any asymptotic structure (e.g. AF/ALF, ALE, compact), we prove that infinitesimal Einstein deformations admit a closed 2-form that measures the perturbation to this charge. In the ALF and compact cases, we furthermore prove that a curve of metrics in the moduli space passing through the background instanton is conformally Kahler to second perturbative order.

## 2. The Physics of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology

**Authors:** Krzysztof A. Meissner, Roger Penrose

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24263v1)

**Summary:**

According to conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC), the currently conventional description of the entire history of the universe (but without an initial inflationary phase) provides but one cosmic aeon of an unending sequence of such aeons. The future conformal infinity of each aeon joins essentially smoothly to the conformally stretched big bang of the next, across a spacelike 3-surface, referred to as a crossover 3- surface. A novel idea is introduced here to show how crossover takes place naturally during a temporal period of the the universe that is dominated by gravitational waves.

## 3. An alternative approach in the generalized Chaplygin gas model in higher   dimensional space-time

**Authors:** D. Panigrahi, B. C. Paul, S. Chatterjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24239v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24239v1)

**Summary:**

In the paper, we have presented a higher-dimensional cosmological model with a generalized Chaplygin-type gas to explain the recent acceleration of the universe. A note worthy aspect of the model is that the resulting field equation is highly nonlinear with respect to the scale factor. This nonlinearity allows us to describe both dust-dominated and accelerating universes, though only in extremal cases. We obtain solutions of the non-linear field equations which are new and interesting. We also explore the evolution of the deceleration parameter, effective EoS, jerk parameter, etc., both analytically and graphically.

## 4. Beijing Normal University 12 meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector   Prototype

**Authors:** Mengyao Wang, Fan Zhang, Xinyao Guo, Haixing Miao, Huan Yang, Yiqiu Ma, Haoyu Wang, Teng Zhang, Mengdi Cao, Yuchao Chen, Xiaoman Huang, Junlang Li, Fangfei Liu, Jianyu Liu, Yuan Pan, Yulin Xia, Jianbo Xing, Yujie Yu, Chenjie Zhou, Zong-hong Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24178v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24178v1)

**Summary:**

The Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. The BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. The prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNu prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.

## 5. Characteristic initial value problems for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar   field equations in spherical symmetry

**Authors:** Thomas Mädler, Radouane Gannouj, Emanuel Gallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24162v1)

**Summary:**

The characteristic initial boundary problem is discussed in spherical symmetry for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations. It is formulated for an affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a hierarchical system of partial differential equations. As an application, the nonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in null coordinates for a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution for a black hole are derived.

## 6. Non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes excited by tidal   resonances in binary neutron stars

**Authors:** Alexis Reboul-Salze, Aurélie Astoul, Hao-Jui Kuan, Arthur G. Suvorov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24154v1)

**Summary:**

During a neutron-star merger, the tidal force can excite stellar oscillation modes to large amplitudes. With rotation, inertial modes can be excited as well. While their non-linear saturation has been studied, an extension to fully-consistent gravito-inertial modes is an open problem. A new (non-)linear formulation based on the separation of equilibrium and dynamical tides is developed. The new formulation accurately reproduces results of linear calculations for gravito inertial mode with a free surface for low frequencies.

## 7. Generic linearized curvature singularity at the perturbed Kerr Cauchy   horizon

**Authors:** Sebastian Gurriaran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24114v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the precise asymptotics of the spin $-2$ Teukolsky field in the interior and along the Cauchy horizon of a subextremal Kerr black hole. This supports the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in Kerr spacetimes. The derivation of a precise lower bound is more delicate than in thespin $+2$ case, and relies on a novel ODE method based on a decomposition of the Teukolsky operator between radial and time derivatives.

## 8. Dynamics of Spinning Test Body in quadratic Einstein-Cartan Theory and   its Free-fall Test

**Authors:** Kun Hu, Zhiyuan Yu, Taotao Qiu, Zhongkun Hu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087v1)

**Summary:**

We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory. We find that the trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\textendash Papapetrou equation. This is due to the coupling of the spin of the test particle to the torsion field of the environment. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical foundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth force.

## 9. Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources I:   Expected fraction of signals with significant dephasing in the dynamical and   AGN channels

**Authors:** Lorenz Zwick, János Takátsy, Pankaj Saini, Kai Hendriks, Johan Samsing, Christopher Tiede, Connar Rowan, Alessandro A. Trani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24084v1)

**Summary:**

We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources. We collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions.

## 10. Hint of $r\simeq 0.01$ after DESI DR2 ?

**Authors:** Hao Wang, Yun-Song Piao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23918v1)

**Summary:**

In the report by BICEP and Keck collaborations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}<0.036$ (95\% C.L.) and $ <1.3\sigma$ non-zero (with pre-DESI BAO data) However, recent datasets have significantly shifted the bestfit values of relevant $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters, and thus possibly alter the amplitude of lensing B-mode spectrum, which would affect the search for $r$.

## 11. Quasinormal modes of a dyonic black hole in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg   theory

**Authors:** Shubham Kala, Abhishek Negi, Hemwati Nandan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23894v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes of a non-rotating dyonic black hole within the framework of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg theory. We present a detailed analysis focuses on understanding the influence of dyonic charges on the oscillatory properties of these BHs. The results are then systematically compared with those of black holes possessing purely electric or purely magnetic charges. This comparison highlights the unique signatures and dynamic behavior introduced by the presence of Dyonic charges, offering deeper insights into the properties of black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics theories.

## 12. Modelling Gaia photometry signals of dark halos

**Authors:** George Pappas, Ippocratis D. Saltas, Laurent Eyer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23868v1)

**Summary:**

Microlensing can provide a means to probe halos of exotic matter, possibly clumped around compact objects such as black holes. This could potentially cover a broad range of physical scenarios - from dark matter mini-halos to black holes with bosonic configurations around them. The signature of the multiple images, the magnification and the light-curve could be the smoking gun of such structures. We discuss how the precise observations of the {\it Gaia} survey offer an opportunity to search for new, yet undiscovered fundamental fields interacting gravitationally with baryons.
