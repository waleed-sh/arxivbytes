## 0. Effective Field Theory Description of Hawking Radiation

**Authors:** David A. Lowe, Larus Thorlacius

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07722v1)

**Summary:**

A study is made of Hawking radiation from four-dimensional black holes using effective field theory methods. The trace anomaly for the stress tensor in a general curved spacetime background is reproduced using Riegert's action. Imposing physical boundary conditions on an initial Cauchy surface leads to a unique state, analogous to the Unruh state with a vanishing ingoing flux and a finite outgoing flux. In particular, there is no sign of quantum hair arising from this nonlocal effective action.

## 1. Nonparametric extensions of nuclear equations of state: probing the   breakdown scale of relativistic mean-field theory

**Authors:** Isaac Legred, Liam Brodie, Alexander Haber, Reed Essick, Katerina Chatziioannou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07677v1)

**Summary:**

Phenomenological calculations of the properties of dense matter represent a pathway to predicting the microscopic and macroscopic properties of neutron stars. Such theories do not generically have well-controlled uncertainties and may break down within neutron stars, say the authors. They develop a hybrid representation of the dense-matter equation of state, which assumes the form of a relativistic mean-field theory at low densities, while remaining agnostic to any nuclear theory at high densities. Using simulated data for future astrophysical observations, they show that their method can identify the breakdown pressure associated with a potential strong phase transition.

## 2. On the RG flow of the Newton and cosmological constant

**Authors:** Carlo Branchina, Vincenzo Branchina, Filippo Contino, Riccardo Gandolfo, Arcangelo Pernace

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07628v1)

**Summary:**

In this note we comment on the RG flow of the Newton and cosmological constants. Also in view of some recent claims that would rise some doubts on the validity of our recent work [2,3]. Here we show that the arguments and claims of [1] are seriously flawed and cannot be trusted. We conclude by saying that we believe that the claims made in [1) are not valid and that they cannot be relied on as a basis for further research. We also say that we think that some of the arguments made in this article are flawed and should be dismissed.

## 3. Wormholes in Lorentz-violating gravity

**Authors:** Renan B. Magalhães, Leandro A. Lessa, Manoel M. Ferreira Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07590v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the possibility of obtaining traversable wormholes supported by phantom scalar fields in Lorentz-violating gravity. We find wormholes with a Rindler-type acceleration and an effective cosmological constant. Properties of these wormholes, such as their non-flat asymptotics, are investigated. We also find the Ellis-Bronnikov counterpart in this LorentZ-violation scenario. We conclude that wormhole solutions can be found in the presence of Lorent z gravity.

## 4. Identifying Proca-star mergers via consistent ultralight-boson mass   estimates across gravitational-wave events

**Authors:** Ana Lorenzo-Medina, Juan Calderón Bustillo, Samson H. W. Leong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07544v1)

**Summary:**

Black-hole and neutron-star mergers are the most plausible sources of current gravitational-wave observations. mergers of exotic compact objects may mimic these signals. We demonstrate that consistent boson-mass estimates across events can yield conclusive evidence for the existence for a number of Proca-star families. This method provides a new way to detect exotic Compact objects, somewhat using gravitational- wave detectors as particle detectors. We show that conclusive evidence could be achieved after 5 to 9 observations of similar event sets, at the $90%$ credible level.

## 5. Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in Metric Variables: The   $\barμ$ Scheme

**Authors:** L. Boldorini, G. Montani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07517v1)

**Summary:**

An effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity. The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.

## 6. Circular Orbits and Photon Orbits at Wormhole Throats

**Authors:** Kristian Gjorgjieski, Jutta Kunz, Petya Nedkova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07507v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07507v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we study timelike circular orbits and photon orbits at the throat of stationary and axisymmetric wormholes. We identify a phase transition in the parameter space, which occurs if an ergoregion is present. Through the use of accretion disk models, the existence of possible stable circular orbits could be linked to accretion disks surrounding the wormhole throat. An analysis of these expressions and the characteristics of the photon orbits gives constraints on wormhole properties, as it hints to possible instabilities.

## 7. Decoherence of quantum superpositions in near-extremal   Reissner-Nordström black holes with quantum gravity corrections

**Authors:** Ran Li, Zhong-Xiao Man, Jin Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07480v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quantum gravity corrected decoherence of quantum superpositions in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By employing the effective field theory approach, we model the black hole as a quantum system coupled to an external source via a scalar field. We find that in the microcanonical ensemble, where the. black hole energy is fixed, quantum gravity corrections do not modify the deco. rate compared to the semiclassical prediction. However, in the canonical ensemble where the black. hole is in a thermal equilibrium state, quantum gravitational effects significantly enhance the dec.oherence rate.

## 8. Multiqubit coherence of mixed states near event horizon

**Authors:** Wen-Mei Li, Jianbo Lu, Shu-Min Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07476v1)

**Summary:**

We study physically accessible and inaccessible N-qubit coherence of the mixed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states for bosonic and fermionic fields. As the number of qubits increases in the mixed W state, its coherence becomes more robust against the degrading effects of Hawking radiation. Our study reveals how Schwarzschild spacetime reshapes quantum resource trade-offs across states, statistics, and correlations, guiding relativistic quantum information tasks.

## 9. Chern-Simons potentials of higher-dimensional Pontryagin densities

**Authors:** Onur Ayberk Çakmak, Özgür Sarıoğlu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the Chern-Simons potentials given the Pontryagin densities in arbitrary even dimensions. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general and allows for non-metricity. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern Simons potential of thePontryagin density given an arbitrary even dimension.

## 10. Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth   (Einstein frame) case study

**Authors:** Marcin Postolak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmologies in the Einstein frame. We show that a chameleon-like coupling modifies both the expansion history and the growth of structure in a way that remains compatible with current fifth-force searches. A causal Israel--Stewart treatment demonstrates that the same coupling supplies an effective bulk pressure that drives a smooth bounce while respecting quantum energy inequalities. These results establish new links between dark-sector interactions, entropy production, and late-time acceleration while identifying observational windows.

## 11. Gravitational lensing of the wormhole in the Eddington-inspired   Born-Infeld spacetime with a cosmic string

**Authors:** Xin-Fei Li, Lei-Hua Liu, Yan-Zhi Meng, Shu-Qing Zhong, Li-Juan Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07420v1)

**Summary:**

The presence of a cosmic string can enhance the light deflection in strong field limit, compared to the case of the Eills-Bronnikov wormhole. The magnification effects of this composite structure could cause some substantial impacts on the angle separation between the first and the rest of the images, and their relative brightness. This work could deepen our understanding of the spacetime structure of the wormhole in EiBI spacetime with one-dimensional topological defects. It could also be used to model some observable aspects in the strong and the weak field limits.

## 12. Exact black hole solutions in gravity with a background Kalb-Ramond   field

**Authors:** Jia-Zhou Liu, Shan-Ping Wu, Shao-Wen Wei, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07404v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07404v1)

**Summary:**

In this framework, Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken when a nonminimally coupled Kalb-Ramond tensor field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black holes using the Iyer-Wald formalism. Our findings reveal that the standard first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr relation remain valid for black holes in the presence of the Kal b Ramond field. The study was published in the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 13. Karmarkar-Tolman Embedded Charged Anisotropic Stars in f(R) Gravity

**Authors:** W. U. Rahman, M. Ilyas, Yi Zhong, De-Liang Yao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07296v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07296v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate various anisotropic spherical distributions of charged celestial bodies within the context of f(R) gravity. The properties of specific charged compact objects are analyzed by using the Karmarkar-Tolman spacetime and three distinct gravitational models. The obtained results are useful to enhance our understanding of how modified gravity theories affect the properties of compact astrophysical objects. We explore the influence of anisotropy on the stability and internal structure of the models. Our findings are compared with predictions from general relativity to highlight the effects of f('R') gravity on charged compact stars.

## 14. Tracing the evolution of eccentric precessing binary black holes: a   hybrid approach

**Authors:** Amitesh Singh, Nathan K. Johnson-McDaniel, Anuradha Gupta, Khun Sang Phukon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07238v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07238v1)

**Summary:**

To describe a general bound binary black hole system, we need to consider orbital eccentricity and the misalignment of black holes' spin vectors with respect to the orbital angular momentum. While binary black holes produced through many formation channels have negligible eccentricity close to merger, they often have a non-negligible eccentricity at formation. The spin tilts inferred in GW astronomy are usually those when the binary is in the band of a GW detector. These can differ significantly from those at formation and it is necessary to evolve the binary back in time to compute the tilts at infinity.
