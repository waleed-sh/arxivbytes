## 0. Incorporating Backreaction in One-Loop Corrections in Ultra-Slow-Roll   Inflation

**Authors:** Cheng-Jun Fang, Zhen-Hong Lyu, Chao Chen, Zong-Kuan Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09555v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the one-loop quantum correction to the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations in the ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflationary scenario. In the spatially-flat gauge, we expand the background inflaton field up to second order. This finding underscores the importance of accounting for the backreaction effects in the analysis of quantum corrections during USR inflation, the authors say. The authors conclude that the results of their study are consistent with previous results in the literature.

## 1. Non-Perturbative Hamiltonian and Higher Loop Corrections in USR   Inflation

**Authors:** Hassan Firouzjahi, Bahar Nikbakht

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09481v1)

**Summary:**

The Hamiltonian for the curvature perturbations and the Goldstone field is presented. It is shown that the loop corrections on long CMB scales increase rapidly with the number of loop $L$ and the setup will go out of perturbative control at the four-loop level. We calculate the higher order loop corrections in USR models which are employed for PBHs formation. We employ the formalism of EFT of inflation in models of single field ultra slow-roll inflation and obtain a non-perturbative result for the Hamiltonian.

## 2. Rigidity results for free boundary hypersurfaces in initial data sets   with boundary

**Authors:** Deivid de Almeida, Abraão Mendes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09433v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09433v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we present several rigidity results for compact free boundary hypersurfaces in initial data sets with boundary. In the first part of the paper, we extend the local splitting theorems from [G. Galloway and H. Jang, Some scalar curvature warped product splitting theoresms, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 148 (2020), no. 6, 2617-2629] To achieve this, we build on the approach of the original paper, utilizing results on free boundary marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) applied to specificinitial data sets.

## 3. Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide   Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3

**Authors:** Kyu-Hyun Chae

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373v1)

**Summary:**

Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly test or measure weak gravity for Newtonian acceleration. New method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10-11.0.

## 4. Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic   censorship and Hoop conjecture

**Authors:** Nitesh Jaiswal, S. Shankaranarayanan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions.

## 5. Localized past stability of the subcritical Kasner-scalar field   spacetimes

**Authors:** F. Beyer, T. A. Oliynyk, W. Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the nonlinear stability, in the contracting direction, of the entire subcritical family of Kasner-scalar field solutions. We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities. Spatial localisation is achieved through our choice of zero-shift, harmonic time slicing that leads to hyperbolic evolution equations with a finite propagation speed. Our proof relies on a zero- shift, orthonormal frame decomposition of a conformal representation of the Einstein-scaled field equations.

## 6. PSR J0952-0607: Probing the Stiffest Equations of State and r-Mode   Suppression Mechanisms

**Authors:** Zeyue Wu, Bhaskar Biswas, Stephan Rosswog

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09200v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09200v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze PSR J0952-0607, the most massive and fastest spinning neutron star observed to date. We refine constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and investigate its robustness against r-mode instabilities. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting rotational effects leads to biases in the inferred EoS, while including neutron star spin produces tighter constraints on pressure-density and mass-radius relations. We explore the r- mode instability window for PSR J0952 0607 under the assumption of both rigid and elastic crust models and find that a rigid crust allows a higher stable temperature range.

## 7. Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations in black hole   with dark matter halo

**Authors:** Sumarna Haroon, Tao Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09171v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09171v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates the gravitational dynamics of a spherically symmetric black hole embedded within a dark matter halo. We analyze key orbital parameters, including marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circular orbits, and periodic orbits. Our results demonstrate a clear correlation between the gravitational waveforms emitted by a small object orbiting a supermassive black hole and the object's zoom-whirl orbital behavior. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black holes and dark matter halos, offering insights into their complex gravitational interactions.

## 8. Equatorial periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms in a black hole   free of Cauchy horizon

**Authors:** Chao-Hui Wang, Xiang-Cheng Meng, Yu-Peng Zhang, Tao Zhu, Shao-Wen Wei

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08994v1)

**Summary:**

A stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole without Cauchy horizons. The results show that, for a fixed rational number, the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit increase with the hair parameter. The phase of the gravitational waves imposes constraints on the parameters of the black hole solutions. As the system evolves, the phase shift of the waveforms becomes increasingly significant, with cumulative deviations becoming more pronounced over time. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole background, the waveform phase will advance for the central black hole.

## 9. Gauss-Bonnet-induced symmetry breaking/restoration during inflation

**Authors:** Yermek Aldabergenov, Daulet Berkimbayev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08986v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08986v1)

**Summary:**

S symmetry breaking or restoration can occur in the middle of inflation due to the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet term to a charged scalar. This can lead to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry, or to its restoration, if it is initially broken. We show the conditions under which the backreaction of the coupling on the inflationary background is negligible, such that the predictions of a given inflationary model are unaffected by the symmetry breaking/restoration process.

## 10. A First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third   Post-Minkowskian Order

**Authors:** Dogan Akpinar, Fernando Febres Cordero, Manfred Kraus, Alexander Smirnov, Mao Zeng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961v1)

**Summary:**

We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and Radiation-re reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity.

## 11. The Nature of Phantom Dark Energy and its Relation to Time Crystals

**Authors:** Laura Mersini-Houghton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08894v1)

**Summary:**

Phantom dark energy is a fluid made up of time crystals that permeate the fabric of space-time. In turn, any well-behaved stable theory of a non-canonical scalar field that acts as phantom dark energy also leads to the production of time crystal. This relation offers a new way of thinking and a deeper insight into the nature of the most inexplicable of all ingredients in the universe, dark energy.

## 12. Dark Energy from Time Crystals

**Authors:** Laura Mersini-Houghton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08887v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we analyze a scalar field model which gives rise to stable bound states in field space characterized by nonzero motion that breaks the underlying time translation symmetry of its Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that an ideal fluid made up of these time crystals behaves as phantom dark energy characterized by an equation of state $w \le -1$ and nonnegative energy density $rho \ge 0$. We also show that the speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2} > 0$ is a sign of a stable fluid.
