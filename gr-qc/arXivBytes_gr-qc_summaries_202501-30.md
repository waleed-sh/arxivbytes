## 0. Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems

**Authors:** Shivam K. Sharma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17852v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17852v1)

**Summary:**

Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of charged scalar field against a charged black hole background. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential.

## 1. On heat coefficients, multiplicative anomaly and 4D Casimir energy for   GJMS operators

**Authors:** Rodrigo Aros, Fabrizzio Bugini, Danilo Díaz, Camilo Nuñez-Barra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17828v1)

**Summary:**

This note aims to verify a prediction on the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly, and the corresponding heat coefficient, for GJMS operators. It stems from the explicit computation of an improved Casimir (or vacuum) energy on the sphere that takes into account the multiplicative anomaly among the (shifted) Laplacian factors. The present heat coefficient computation is based on Juhl's explicit formula for G JMS operators, Gilkey's formula for the integrated heat coefficient of higher-order LaplACians, and Branson and Rsted's conformal principle.

## 2. Gleaning gravitational amplitudes -- a double copy for canceling   dilatons

**Authors:** Henrik Johansson, Ingrid Vazquez-Holm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17818v1)

**Summary:**

Unwanted dilatons are sourced by massive scalar matter, which must be removed from the double copy in order to match the long range gravitational interactions. The same asymmetric double copy needs to be supplemented by the subtraction of bubble graphs that originate both from the axion and a residual dilaton term. At tree level, we find that an asymmetricdouble copy can reproduce the dilaton graphs in general dimension, which we explicitly verify up to six external massive scalars. Considering a one-loop four-point example, the same asymmetry can be used to reproduce a dilaton graph in three dimensions.

## 3. Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type   IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations

**Authors:** Chien-Yu Chou, Jun Nishimura, Ashutosh Tripathi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798v1)

**Summary:**

The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two model around $0$ and in the $0-$0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points.

## 4. Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory

**Authors:** David Andriot, Muthusamy Rajaguru, George Tringas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775v1)

**Summary:**

In most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V>0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V<0$.

## 5. A Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave   Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors

**Authors:** Haowen Zhong, Luca Reali, Bei Zhou, Emanuele Berti, Vuk Mandic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717v1)

**Summary:**

Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect such a background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time.

## 6. Old Ideas for New Physicists III: String Theory Parameters are NOT   Vacuum Expectation Values

**Authors:** T. Banks

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17697v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17697v1)

**Summary:**

It is misleading to think of the parameters in string theory models of quantum gravity as vacuum expectation values of fields. I review, for the benefit of younger physicists, arguments proposed at the beginning of the 21st century, which show that it is misleading. It is time to rethink the way we think about quantum gravity and string theory in general. It's time to re-examine the way in which quantum gravity is thought about in the first place, and to rethink our understanding of it in the second.

## 7. Inverse logarithmic correction in the HBAR entropy of an atom falling   into a renormalization group improved charged black hole

**Authors:** Arpita Jana, Soham Sen, Sunandan Gangopadhyay

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17579v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we have considered a spherically symmetric non-rotating charged black hole geometry where both the Newton's gravitational constant and the charge of the black hole flows with the energy scale. We have used the Kretschmann scale identification to write down the finite cutoff for the momentum scale in terms of the proper distance. We find that the probability of the atom for going from its ground state to the excited state via emission of a virtual photon deviates slightly from the pure Planckian spectrum.

## 8. Gravity from (A)dS Yang-Mills: a natural reduction

**Authors:** Goffredo Chirco, Alfonso Lamberti, Lucio Vacchiano, Patrizia Vitale

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17574v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the relation between a one-parameter family of (anti)-de Sitter Yang-Mills models and Einstein-Palatini gravity in the absence of matter. The action is shown to reproduce the Einstein equations of General Relativity when the parameter labelling the gauge group is set to zero. In this limit the components of the gauge connection consistently reduce to tetrads and spin connection, transforming in the standard way under the local Lorentz group. Moreover, the full gauge symmetry of the Yang-mills action gives rise to the invariance under diffeomorphisms and local Lorenntz transformations.

## 9. Calculating the Hawking Temperature of Black Holes in $f(Q)$ Gravity   Using the RVB Method: A Residue-Based Approach

**Authors:** Wen-Xiang Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17485v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the computation of Hawking temperatures for black holes within various $f(Q)$ gravity models using the RVB method. This topological approach uncovers an additional term in the temperature calculation, which we propose originates from the residue of a specific contour integral related to the metric or curvature. Our findings provide new insights into black hole thermodynamics within modified gravity frameworks. We demonstrate that the correction term can consistently be interpreted as this residue. The paper was published in the journal Science.

## 10. Quantum Cross-section of Near-extremal Black Holes

**Authors:** Roberto Emparan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17470v1)

**Summary:**

We scatter a low-frequency wave of a massless, minimal scalar off the black hole and calculate the absorption cross-section. In the semiclassical regime, where the Schwarzian is weakly coupled, we recover the universal result that the cross- section equals the horizon area. However, in the strongly coupled regime, we find that the absorptionCross-section exceeds the prediction. We conclude that a measurement showing an enhanced absorption Cross-section serves as a clear signature of the large quantum fluctuations in the geometry.

## 11. Asymptotic Limit of Null Hypersurfaces

**Authors:** Luca Ciambelli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17357v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17357v1)

**Summary:**

We study null hypersurfaces approaching null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes within the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The null Raychaudhuri constraint is shown to asymPTote to the bondi mass-loss formula, interpreted as a stress tensor conservation law. This connection between finite-distance null physics and null infinity unveils promising insights. We establish that the canonical phase space on finite- distance null hypersURfaces asymptic to the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space.
