## 0. Scalar field source Teleparallel Robertson-Walker F(T)-gravity solutions

**Authors:** Alexandre Landry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13895v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a scalar field source. The new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications in dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy and quintom models of physical processes. For $k=0$, we find an easy-to-compute $F (T) $ solution formula applicable for any scalarField source. We obtain, for $k=-1$ and $+1$ situations, some new analytical $F('T') solutions, only for specific $n$-parameter values.

## 2. Redshift leverage for the search of GRB neutrinos affected by quantum   properties of spacetime

**Authors:** Giovanni Amelino-Camelia, Giacomo D'Amico, Vittorio D'Esposito, Giuseppe Fabiano, Domenico Frattulillo, Giulia Gubitosi, Dafne Guetta, Alessandro Moia, Giacomo Rosati

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13840v1)

**Summary:**

Some previous studies based on IceCube neutrinos had found intriguing preliminary evidence that some of them might be GRB neutrino. Travel times affected by quantum properties of spacetime delaying them proportionally to their energy, an effect often labeled as "quantum-spacetime-induced in-vacuo dispersion" The new approach restricts the analysis to GRBs of sharply known redshift, and, in a way that we argue is synergistic with having sharp information on redshift. Our findings are still inconclusive, since their significance is quantified by a $p$-value of little less than $0.01$.

## 3. Probing the Unstable Spectrum of Schwarzschild-like Black Holes

**Authors:** Pedro Henrique Croti Siqueira, Lucas Tobias de Paula, Rodrigo Panosso Macedo, Maurício Richartz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13815v1)

**Summary:**

Recent findings suggest that random perturbations to the effective potential associated with gravitational waves may enhance the stability of the underlying wave operator. We investigate the pseudospectrum of a Schwarzschild-like spacetime within the framework of black hole perturbation theory. We find that, in contrast to the QNM spectrum of the Schwarzschild spacetime, the quasinormal spectrum of a black hole deformed through a physically motivated implementation of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko parametrization is unstable.

## 4. Optical Images of Mini Boson Stars in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Xiao-Xiong Zeng, Chen-Yu Yang, Yu-Xiang Huang, Ke-Jian He, Guo-Ping Li, Sen Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13764v1)

**Summary:**

Mini boson stars lack stable photon rings due to the positive second derivative of their effective potential. Their images are dominated by direct emissions from photons completing a single orbit. The study examines the dependence of the optical characteristics on the initial scalar field and the coupling parameter. Numerical results include effective potentials, redshift maps, and detailed imaging of boson star. The results provide insights into distinguishing bosonStars from black holes using high-resolution astronomical observations. The findings are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 5. Regular Black Hole from gravitational collapse of dust and radiation

**Authors:** Vitalii Vertogradov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13739v1)

**Summary:**

A black hole is the end state of the gravitational collapse of massive stars. A typical black hole contains a singularity and to avoid singularity formation we have to violate a strong energy condition that states that gravity must attract. In this paper, we offer a simple model of gravitational collapse. In the simplest case, such a model leads to a singular black hole. However, if we assume an energy exchange between dust and radiation, which increases towards the center of the collapsing cloud, then it becomes possible to construct a model of a regular black Hole.

## 6. Naked and truly naked rotating black holes

**Authors:** H. V. Ovcharenko, O. B. Zaslavskii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13719v1)

**Summary:**

In some space-times with Killing horizons some curvature components, responsible for tidal forces, become enhanced from the viewpoint of a falling observer. This leads to the notion of so-called naked black holes. Previous results included static spherically symmetric or distorted static metrics. In the present work, we generalized them to include rotation in consideration. We also scrutiny how the algebraic type can change in the vicinity of the horizon due to local Lorentz boost. We analyze the behavior of Weyl scalar for different kinds of observers.

## 7. Micro-Tidal Disruption Events at Galactic Centers

**Authors:** Xinyu Li, Houyi Sun, Yuan-Chuan Zou, Huan Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13702v1)

**Summary:**

Micro-Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) is associated with high-speed white dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. It happens at galactic centers, where a white dwarf orbiting around the massive black hole scatters with a stellar- mass black hole. The properties of some of the transient X-ray bursts found by Einstein Probe are consistent with the micro-TDE scenario considered here. The main EM signatures are an X-rays flare followed by a relatively faint optical flare.

## 8. On the Gauge Invariance of Secondary Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Chen Yuan, Yizhou Lu, Zu-Cheng Chen, Lang Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13691v1)

**Summary:**

Second-order tensor perturbations induced by primordial fluctuations play a crucial role in probing small-scale physics. gauge dependence of their energy density has remained a fundamental challenge in cosmological perturbation theory. We introduce a boundary condition-based filtering method that extracts physical radiation through the Sommerfeld criterion. We demonstrate that after filtering non-physical modes, the energy density of secondary gravitational waves becomes gauge-invariant and exhibits physically consistent behavior in the sub-horizon limit.

## 9. Revealing turbulent Dark Matter via merging of self-Gravitating   condensates

**Authors:** Anirudh Sivakumar, Pankaj Kumar Mishra, Ahmad A. Hujeirat, Paulsamy Muruganandam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13689v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13689v1)

**Summary:**

Self-gravitating condensates have been proposed as potential candidates for modelling dark matter. We have used the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson model and identified distinct turbulent regimes based on the merging speed of the condensate. Our study may offer valuable insights into the merging of binary stars and open new avenues for understanding the structure and dynamics of the dark matter through self-Gravitating Condensates, the authors say. The study may also offer insights into how binary stars merge.

## 10. On thermodynamics of charged and accelerating black holes

**Authors:** Tomáš Hale, David Kubizňák, Jana Menšíková, Robert B. Mann, Jiayue Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13679v1)

**Summary:**

We reconsider various C-metric spacetimes describing charged and (slowly) accelerating AdS black holes in different theories of (non-linear) electrodynamics. Focusing first on the Maxwell theory, we find a parametrization of the metric where we can eliminate the non-trivial `normalization' of the boost Killing vector. We also calculate the Euclidean action using i) the standard holographic renormalization and ii) using the topological renormalized.

## 11. Exploring gravitational impulse via quantum Boltzmann equation

**Authors:** Mohammad Sharifian, Moslem Zarei, Nicola Bartolo, Sabino Matarrese

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE) The initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE equation operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Through this procedure, we obtain the leading order of the system's impulse. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.

## 12. Forecasted Detection Limits on the (Dark) Matter Density in Supermassive   Black Hole Binaries for LISA

**Authors:** Matthias Daniel, Kris Pardo, Laura Sagunski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13601v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13601v1)

**Summary:**

Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are among the most powerful known sources of gravitational waves (GWs) These systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times of SMBHBs. We simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to milliHertz frequency range.

## 13. Orbital Motion in Spacetimes Influenced by the Presence of Scalar and   Electromagnetic Fields

**Authors:** J. Horák, T. Tahamtan, T. Hale, G. Török, A. Kotrlová, E. Šrámková

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13538v1)

**Summary:**

Study investigates orbital motion of test particles near compact objects. Analysis shows that in certain cases the central object transitions into a naked singularity. Deviations from classical Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions reveal conditions for the existence of multiple photon orbits or marginally stable orbits. In some instances, the geometry allows the presence of two photon orbits -- one stable and one unstable -- with an interesting connection to the region of stable orbits, the authors say. They find that at lower intensities the effects of the scalar field and electromagnetic fields are comparable and seemingly interchangeable.

## 14. Navigating permanent underdetermination in dark energy and inflationary   cosmology

**Authors:** William J. Wolf, James Read

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13521v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13521v1)

**Summary:**

We identify troubling cases of so-called `permanent underdetermination' in both dark energy and inflationary cosmology. We argue that, under certain conditions, there are available viable responses which can alleviate at least some of the concerns about underdetermination. However, outside of these specific scenarios, the epistemic threat of permanent underdetermination will persist. We bring to bear (a) a taxonomy of possible responses to underdetermination, and (b) an understanding of both darkEnergy and inflationARY cosmology from an effective field point of view.

## 15. Detection of Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Globular Clusters:   Revealing the Brownian Motion with Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Alejandro Torres-Orjuela, Verónica Vázquez-Aceves, Tian-Xiao Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13466v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13466v1)

**Summary:**

 Intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) formed by stellar-mass compact objects orbiting intermediate-mass black holes will be detected by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories like TianQin, LISA, and AION. We study a set of 100 IMRI systems in globular clusters obtained from MOCCA simulations to study their detectability. We find that a small fraction of IMRIs ($<10\,\%$) will have signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) high enough to be detected.

## 16. Can we hear beats with pulsar timing arrays?

**Authors:** Shun Yamamoto, Hideki Asada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13450v1)

**Summary:**

An isolated supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) produces an identical cross-correlation pattern of pulsar timings as an isotropic stochastic background gravitational waves (GWs) generated possibly by inflation. Can there remain the identical pattern in the presence of a secondary SMBHB? To address this issue, the present paper considers GWs with slightly different frequencies $f_1$ and $ f_2$ coming from two different directions. Beats between the two GWs can modify angular correlation patterns. We obtain an analytic formula to present a proof-of-principle that $f_{beat}$ can be measured from the modulated angular correlations.

## 17. Probing new scalars with the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and the   weak equivalence principle violation

**Authors:** Xitong Mei, Dongfeng Gao, Wei Zhao, Jin Wang, Mingsheng Zhan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13384v1)

**Summary:**

A new scalar particle with generic couplings to the standard-model particles is a possible source for the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and the violation of the weak equivalence principle. We find that a scalar which couples merely to the photon or leptons can not be consistent with three experimental results. We show that the minimal standard- model extension by one scalar is also not favored for scalar mass below $10^4$ eV. It has to couple to both the photon and lepton simultaneously.

## 18. One-dimensional linear analysis and numerical simulations of Alfven   waves in a force-free magnetosphere around a Kerr black hole

**Authors:** Shinji Koide, Sousuke Noda, Masaaki Takahashi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13314v1)

**Summary:**

The Alfven wave induces a fast magnetosonic wave in the case of a spinning black hole. Energy conservation is confirmed when this additional induced magnetosonics wave is considered. We also observe the reflection of the inwardly propagating Alfvenwave around the static limit, which is prohibited in theory when using the eikonal approximation. We use the results to investigate the dynamic process of wave propagation and energy transport for Alfven waves. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.
