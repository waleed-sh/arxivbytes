## 0. Determinism and Asymmetry in General Relativity

**Authors:** JB Manchak, Thomas Barrett, Hans Halvorson, James Owen Weatherall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05668v1)

**Summary:**

This paper concerns the question of which collections of general relativistic spacetimes are deterministic relative to which definitions. We begin by considering a series of three definitions of increasing strength due to Belot (1995) The strongest of these definitions is particularly interesting for spacetime theories because it involves an asymmetry condition called ''rigidity'' We go on to explore other asymmetry conditions that give rise to other (stronger) forms of determinism. We also highlight a number of open questions.

## 1. Topological modes, non-locality and the double copy

**Authors:** William T. Emond, Laura Engelbrecht, Nathan Moynihan, Chris D. White

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05653v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05653v1)

**Summary:**

The double copy connects scattering amplitudes and other objects in gauge and gravity theories. Open conceptual issues include whether non-local information in gravity theories can be generated from the double copy. We show how our conclusions apply to four- and five-point scattering Amplitudes in topological gauge / gravity theories, as a by-product obtaining greatly simplified analytic expressions for the four-point amplitudes. We clarify the role of BCJ shifts in modifying how topological modes contribute. We argue that topological theories (with and without mass) in 2+1 dimensions make a useful playground for exploring non-locality.

## 2. Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions   restricts scalar-tensor theories

**Authors:** Hajime Kobayashi, Shinji Mukohyama, Johannes Noller, Sergi Sirera, Kazufumi Takahashi, Vicharit Yingcharoenrat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05651v1)

**Summary:**

Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity. We find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, we identify allowed deviations fromGR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-Trivial speed of gravitational waves.

## 3. Search for primordial black holes from gravitational wave populations   using deep learning

**Authors:** Hai-Long Huang, Jun-Qian Jiang, Jibin He, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05570v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves (GWs) signals detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration might be sourced (partly) by the merges of primordial black holes (PBHs) The conventional Bayesian inference methods can allow us to study population properties of GW events to search for PBHs. However, hierarchical Bayesian analysis require an analytic population model, and becomes increasingly computationally expensive as the number of sources grows. In this paper, we present a novel population analysis method based on deep learning, which enables the direct and efficient estimation of PBH population hyperparameters.

## 4. A novel Lagrange-multiplier approach to the effective-one-body dynamics   of binary systems in post-Minkowskian gravity

**Authors:** Thibault Damour, Alessandro Nagar, Andrea Placidi, Piero Rettegno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05487v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05487v1)

**Summary:**

Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the conservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of EOB-PM Hamiltonians. For the first time, an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers EOB/NR unfaithfulness of at most $1\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity catalog up to mass ratio $q=15.

## 5. Peaks sphericity of non-Gaussian random fields

**Authors:** Cristiano Germani, Mohammad Ali Gorji, Michiru Uwabo-Niibo, Masahide Yamaguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05434v1)

**Summary:**

We present a formalism valid regardless of how large the deviation from Gaussian statistics is. We show that the effects of small perturbative non-Gaussianity on the sphericity parameters are negligible, as they are even smaller than the subleading Gaussian corrections. In contrast, we find that large non- Gaussianity can significantly distort the peak configurations, making them much less spherical. The framework applies to any system with a given power spectrum and the corresponding bispectrum in the regime in which contributions from higher-order correlators can be neglected.

## 6. Impact of eccentricity and mean anomaly in numerical relativity mergers

**Authors:** Peter James Nee, Aldo Gamboa, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Lorenzo Pompili, Antoni Ramos-Buades, Vijay Varma, Michael Boyle, Alessandra Buonanno, Raffi Enficiaud, Lawrence E. Kidder, Mark A. Scheel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05422v1)

**Summary:**

Accurate modelling of black hole binaries is critical to achieve the science goals of gravitational-wave detectors. Modelling such configurations relies strongly on calibration to numerical-relativity (NR) simulations. We demonstrate that, for fixed eccentricity, many quantities related to the merger dynamics of binary black holes show an oscillatory dependence on mean anomaly. We find that for the eccentricities explored in this work, deviations in various quantities such as the merger amplitude and peak luminosity can approach their quasi-circular value.

## 7. Testing classicality of gravity by gravitation decoherence

**Authors:** V. P. Stefanov, D. S. Mogilevtsev, I. Y. Rybak, A. Stefanov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05350v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05350v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss an influence of an external weak gravitational field on the gravitational self-decoherence effect with help of the stochastic extension of regularized Shr\"odinger-Newton equation in a curved background. We derive the master equation and demonstrate that it leads to the experimentally verifiable conclusions about applicability of the weak gravitation field. Namely, a presence of oscillating terms in the otherwise purely exponential decay of the coherence would indicate classicality of gravity for the case.

## 8. Chern-Simons Inspired Massive Gravity

**Authors:** J. Chagoya, M. Sabido, A. Silva-Garc√≠a

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05210v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we propose a new 2+1 theory of gravity. We start with a modification of Chern-Simons 2-1 gravity. The second order expansion of this action is equivalent to New Massive Gravity. We explore solutions to the theory and show that it has a BTZ solution with an effective cosmological constant in terms of the parameters of the theory, global Lifshitz space-times and asymptotically flat black holes. We show that the action can be rewritten as a Born-Infeld type action.

## 9. The growth of linear perturbations in the interacting dark energy models   and observational constraints

**Authors:** Kaiwen Liu, Xiangyun Fu, Bing Xu, Chikun Ding, Yang Huang, Xin Qing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05208v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we investigate the influence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy on the growth rate $f$ of matter density perturbations. The coupling term is assumed to be proportional to the dark energy density. The growth rate is parameterized using the form $Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$. We utilize this parameterized form, along with the astronomic observations from Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background, Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, to make constraints on the free parameters.

## 10. Bridging between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential   inflation

**Authors:** Ok Song An, Jin U Kang, Yong Jin Kim, Ui Ri Mun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05202v1)

**Summary:**

We propose an idea to build a bridge between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation by backtracking the evolution of the inflaton field from the present time to the end of reheating. We find a simple analytic relation between the reheating temperature and the observational parameters for dark energy, and numerically confirm its validity. This relation is universal and can apply to all quint essential inflation models with any reheating mechanism. It also implies that any quintessentialflation model with a successful reheating predicts the equation of state of dark energy today extremely close to $-1.

## 11. Vacuum stress between conducting plates: the curved spacetime version

**Authors:** Borzoo Nazari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05148v1)

**Summary:**

Brown and Maclay found the energy-momentum tensor for the Casimir effect of parallel plates in 1969. We find its curved spacetime version in a static background using the point splitting regularization method. Previous results in the literature are reinforced and some consequences discussed. We also discuss the consequences of our results on the nature of the universe and how they relate to our understanding of it. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for the theory of relativity and quantum gravity.

## 12. Renormalized Quantum Stress-Energy Tensor of a Nonzero Radius Cosmic   String

**Authors:** Noah Graham

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05129v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the effects of quantum fluctuations of a scalar field in the "ballpoint pen" cosmic string geometry. This calculation provides one of the few examples where quantum effects in curved spacetime can be explicitly calculated. The calculation demonstrates in detail the process of renormalization in curved Spacetime, including the effect of the conformal anomaly. We extend the approach to renormalized energy density in two space dimensions to $3+1$ dimensions, nonzero scalar mass, and the full stress-energy tensor.

## 13. Restricted Gravity: Lagrangian Formalism and Explicit Solutions

**Authors:** S. H. Oh, Sangwoo Kim, Y. M. Cho

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05059v1)

**Summary:**

The restricted gravity is simpler than Einstein's theory but describes the core dynamics of Einstein's gravity. We show that in the restricted gravity the Rosen-Bondi gravitational plane wave could be described by two spin-one Maxwellian potentials. This could play important role in quantum gravity. In this paper we present interesting solutions of the restrictedgravity, in particular the gravitational cosmic string, the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime, the axisymmetric pp-wave, and the conformally flat waves with flat wavefront.
