## 0. Bunch-Davies initial conditions and non-perturbative inflationary   dynamics in Numerical Relativity

**Authors:** Yoann L. Launay, Gerasimos I. Rigopoulos, E. Paul S. Shellard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06783v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06783v1)

**Summary:**

We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using numerical relativity. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies vaccuum and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model.

## 1. Expanding the Quantum-Limited Gravitational-Wave Detection Horizon

**Authors:** Liu Tao, Mohak Bhattacharya, Peter Carney, Luis Martin Gutierrez, Luke Johnson, Shane Levin, Cynthia Liang, Xuesi Ma, Michael Padilla, Tyler Rosauer, Aiden Wilkin, Jonathan W. Richardson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06702v1)

**Summary:**

Achieving greater quantum-noise-limited sensitivity to spacetime strain hinges on achieving higher circulating laser power, in excess of 1~MW, in conjunction with highly-squeezed quantum states of light. The new technology will enable significantly higher levels of laser power and squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors. It can reduce the noise floor of the detectors by up to 20\% from 200~Hz to 5~kHz, corresponding to an increment of 4~Mpc in the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers.

## 2. Larmor radiation as a witness to the Unruh effect

**Authors:** Atsushi Higuchi, George E. A. Matsas, Daniel A. T. Vanzella, Robert Bingham, Joao P. B. Brito, Luis C. B. Crispino, Gianluca Gregori, Georgios Vacalis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06630v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the emission of radiation from general sources in quantum scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields using the Rindler coordinate frame. In particular, we point out that, to recover the usual Larmor radiation in the interaction picture, it is necessary to incorporate the Unruh effect. The observation of classical L armor radiation could be seen as vindicating the UnRuh effect in the sense that it is not correctly reproduced in this context unless the Un Ruh effect is taken into account.

## 3. A scaling invariance of the perturbations in $k$-inflation models

**Authors:** Neven Bilić, Dragoljub D. Dimitrijević, Goran S. Djordjević, Milan Milošević, Marko Stojanović

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06456v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06456v1)

**Summary:**

We study the background and perturbations in two classes of $k$-inflation models with the potential characterized by an inflection point. We demonstrate that these models enjoy scaling properties which could be used to redefine input parameters so that the perturbation spectra satisfy correct normalization at the CMB pivot scale. The background andperturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. We conclude that the models can be used as a basis for the development of new models.

## 4. Looking To The Horizon: Probing Evolution in the Black Hole Spectrum   With GW Catalogs

**Authors:** Jam Sadiq, Thomas Dent, Ana Lorenzo Medina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06451v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06451v1)

**Summary:**

The population of black holes observed via gravitational waves currently covers the local universe up to a redshift $z\lesssim 1$ for the most massive merging binaries. Evolution of the BBH mass spectrum over cosmic time will be a significant probe of formation channels and environments. Significantly upgraded detectors and/or facilities, and longer observing times, are required to harness any correlations of theBBH mass distribution with redshift. We compare these findings with previous investigations and caution against over-interpreting the current, sparse, data.

## 5. The reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector

**Authors:** Si-Wei Han, Wenjing Chen, Langxuan Chen, Zhichun Ouyang, Jun Feng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation.

## 6. Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from   Inspiral through Merger

**Authors:** Lorenzo Ennoggi, Manuela Campanelli, Yosef Zlochower, Scott C. Noble, Julian Krolik, Federico Cattorini, Jay V. Kalinani, Vassilios Mewes, Michail Chabanov, Liwei Ji, Maria Chiara de Simone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06389v1)

**Summary:**

Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. The authors have developed a novel 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger.

## 7. Investigating the shadows of new regular black holes with a Minkowski   core: Effects of spherical accretion and core type differences

**Authors:** Yi Xiong, Jin Pu, Yi Ling, Guo-Ping Li, Gao-Ming Deng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06388v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the shadows and optical appearances of a new type of regular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core under different spherical accretion. These BHs are constructed by modifying the Newtonian potential based on the minimum observable length in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle. Compared with Bardeen BH, the new BH has a smaller total observed intensity, dimmer maximum luminosity, and smaller shadow and photon sphere radius. It suggests that the unique spacetime features of these regular BHS with different cores can be distinguished through astronomical observations.

## 8. Gravitational Lensing by a Dark Compact Object in Modified Gravity and   Observational Constraints from Einstein Rings

**Authors:** Nagina Rehman, Zoe C. S. Chan, Mubasher Jamil, Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06313v1)

**Summary:**

The aim is to analyze new insights into the nature of gravitational interactions. We compute weak and strong deflection angles for the specified static, spherically symmetric MOG spacetime. By employing a supermassive galactic black hole as a gravitational lens, we compare various parameters in MOG with those of the Schwarzschild black hole in strong-field scenarios. We model the black holes M87 and Sgr A as lenses within the MOG framework, calculating lensing coefficients and distortion parameters in the weak field regime.

## 9. Consistency Problems of Conformal Killing Gravity

**Authors:** Emel Altas, Bayram Tekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06262v1)

**Summary:**

Gravity field equations based on a tensor with rank greater than 2 have consistency problems. Conformal Killing Gravity, an interesting extension of General Relativity, is plagued with this problem. In this theory, it is not clear at all how one can define the energy and angular momentum for black hole solutions, or define the analogues of the formulas, such as the quadrupole formula, in the weak field limit for gravitational waves emitted by compact sources. We show that gravity field equations with a rank-3 tensor field equation that does not arise from a diffeomorphism-invariant action are not consistent.

## 10. Gravitational Wave Memory from Accelerating Relativistic Jets in   Multiple Thick Shell Scenarios

**Authors:** Yusuke Sakai, Ryo Yamazaki, Yoshihiro Okutani, Satsuki Ueno, Norichika Sago, Marco Meyer-Conde, Hirotaka Takahashi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06110v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave (GW) memory is anticipated during the acceleration of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) While the precise mechanism behind GRBs is not yet fully understood, detecting GW memory may contribute to clarifying their nature. In this paper, we consider various scenarios of GW memory emission, including both single and multiple shells with thin- and thick-shells. The memory spectrum for each scenario is compared with the sensitivity of next-generation detectors, namely DECIGO and ET-D.

## 11. Transportable Optical Lattice Clocks and General Relativity

**Authors:** Hisaaki Shinkai, Masao Takamoto, Hidetoshi Katori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06104v1)

**Summary:**

 Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) enable us to measure time and frequency with a fractional uncertainty at $10^{-18}$ level, which is 2 orders of magnitude better than Cs clocks. We report our experiments of measuring the gravitational redshift between RIKEN and The University of Tokyo, and at Tokyo Skytree. We also discuss a couple of future applications of OLCs, such as detecting gravitational waves in space and relativistic geodesy. The possibility of testing second-order parametrized post-Newtonian potential around the Earth is also mentioned.
