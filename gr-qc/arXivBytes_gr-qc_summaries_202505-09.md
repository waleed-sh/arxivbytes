## 0. Screened Axio-dilaton Cosmology: Novel Forms of Early Dark Energy

**Authors:** Adam Smith, Philippe Brax, Carsten van de Bruck, C. P. Burgess, Anne-Christine Davis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05450v1)

**Summary:**

We study the cosmology of multi-field Dark Energy using a well-motivated axio-dilaton model. The required axion-matter couplings also modify cosmology, with the axion's background energy density turning out to resemble early dark energy. We find that increasing the dilaton-matter coupling decreases the growth of structure due to enhanced Hubble friction, an effect that dominates the usual fifth-force effects that amplify structure growth. We explore the implications of these models for the Cosmic Microwave Background and the grow of structure.

## 1. Quantum effects in rotating thermal states on anti-de Sitter space-time

**Authors:** Jacob C. Thompson, Elizabeth Winstanley

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05448v1)

**Summary:**

We study the stress-energy tensor of a massless, conformally coupled, quantum scalar field in a rigidly-rotating thermal state on three- and four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time. We use relativistic kinetic theory, modelling the field as a thermal gas of massless bosons. We then compute the renormalized stress- Energy Tensor of the field in quantum field theory and compare it with that resulting from relativists kinetic theory.

## 2. Boundary Energy-Momentum Tensors for Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes

**Authors:** Jelle Hartong, Emil Have, Vijay Nenmeli, Gerben Oling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05432v1)

**Summary:**

We consider 3D and 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes near future null infinity endowed with the most general allowed Carroll geometry. We define a boundary energy-momentum tensor by varying the on-shell action with respect to the Carroll metric data. This requires adding counterterms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We show that, in 4D, the shear is on par with the Carroll metrics. The resulting complex is equivalent to the Bondi mass and angular momentum loss equations.

## 3. Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed   neutron stars

**Authors:** Takuya Katagiri, Gowtham Rishi Mukkamala, Kent Yagi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429v1)

**Summary:**

Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables. These relations do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, the authors say. The findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, according to the authors. They say this is consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.

## 4. Starobinsky like inflation and EGB Gravity in the light of ACT

**Authors:** Yogesh, Abolhassan Mohammadi, Qiang Wu, Tao Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05363v1)

**Summary:**

Act data shows an enhancement in the value of the scalar spectral index, leading to disfavoring many inflationary models, including the Starobinsky model. To satisfy the constraint made by ACT, we will investigate the starobinsky potential within the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB) gravity theory. The model is considered by using the slow-roll approximation method and the exact numerical approach for two different coupling functions. The results indicate that the model is in good agreement with the data.

## 5. Reassessing the foundations of Metric-Affine Gravity

**Authors:** J. François, L. Ravera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05349v1)

**Summary:**

We reassess foundational aspects of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) in light of the Dressing Field Method. We first recall that Cartan geometry is the proper mathematical foundation for gauge theories of gravity. Then, we show how the MAG kinematics is obtained via dressing in a technically streamlined way, which highlights that it reduces to a Cartan-geometric kinematic. We conclude with a look at the current state of the art in the field of gravitational theory and research.

## 6. Hydrodynamic and Electromagnetic Discrepancies between Neutron Star and   Black Hole Spacetimes

**Authors:** Jonathan Gorard, James Juno, Ammar Hakim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05299v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05299v1)

**Summary:**

The exterior spacetime geometry surrounding an uncharged, spinning black hole in general relativity depends only upon its mass and spin. However, the exterior geometry surrounding any other rotating compact object, for example a neutron star, will generally depend upon higher moments in its multipole expansion. In some places, the discrepancies in energy-momentum density are found to reach or exceed 50%, with electric field strength discrepancies in excess of 10%. We argue that many of these differences are likely to be amplified by the inclusion of more sophisticated plasma physics models.

## 7. Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations

**Authors:** Zuhua Ji, Jiarui Chen, Gaojian Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05241v1)

**Summary:**

The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions..

## 8. Gravitational collapse in pure Gauss- Bonnet theory

**Authors:** Akshay Kumar, Ayan Chatterjee, Suresh C. Jaryal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05205v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the gravitational collapse of matter fields, which include dust, perfect fluids as well as fluids admitting bulk and shear viscosity. The initial conditions on these matter fields have been kept to be quite general. We determine the time of formation of the central singularity and the formation and evolution of black hole horizons, depicted here in terms of quasilocal marginally trapped surfaces. Our study shows that under these general conditions, thecentral singularity remains hidden from the asymptotic observer.

## 9. Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes

**Authors:** G. E. Volovik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178v1)

**Summary:**

In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. As a result the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus.

## 10. Constraints Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction for Relativistic   Hydrodynamics with General Equations of State

**Authors:** Sujoy Basak, Arpit Babbar, Harish Kumar, Praveen Chandrashekar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05128v1)

**Summary:**

In the realm of relativistic astrophysics, the ideal equation of state with a constant adiabatic index provides a poor approximation. We develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving special hydrodynamics equations. We validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equations of state in use.

## 11. Waves in Bopp-Land{é}-Thomas-Podolsky generalized electrodynamics

**Authors:** Altin Shala, Volker Perlick

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05033v1)

**Summary:**

We consider wave propagation in vacuum and in a cold and non-magnetized plasma. Dispersion relations are found for all possible transverse and longitudinal modes. Longitudinal traveling waves are found which exhibit negative group velocities. We investigate the feasibility of probing Bopp-Land{\'e}-Thomas-Podolsky generalized electrodynamics with traveling and standing wave experiments. We consider wave propagators in a vacuum and a cold, non-Magnetized Plasma.

## 12. Ghost-induced phase transition in the final stages of black hole   evaporation

**Authors:** Alfio Bonanno, Samuele Silveravalle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05027v1)

**Summary:**

A quantum-induced ghost instability drives the natural evolution of an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole toward a stable naked singularity. This process, arising from quadratic curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high energies, circumvents inconsistencies associated with classical naked singularities. The onset of ghost-driven instability signals a phase transition that fundamentally alters black hole evaporation, rendering the information paradox moot as it merges with the singularity issue. Our findings suggest a new pathway for black hole evolution at high-energy scales.

## 13. Study of Wormholes in Symmetric Teleparallel Theories of Gravity

**Authors:** Moreshwar Tayde

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04952v1)

**Summary:**

This thesis explores traversable wormhole (WH) solutions within symmetric teleparallel gravity and its extensions. It reviews WH geometry and properties, general relativity, and modified gravity's role in WH physics. For linear $f(Q)$ models, suitable redshift and shape functions satisfying the flare-out condition yield viable WHs, with the monopole charge driving Null Energy Condition (NEC) violation. The Volume Integral Quantifier (VIQ) method shows minimal exotic matter is needed.
