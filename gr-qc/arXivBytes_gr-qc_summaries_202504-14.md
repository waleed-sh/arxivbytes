## 0. Hidden Twin Star Solutions from an Agnostic Speed-of-Sound Model:   Confronting XTE J1814--338's Extreme Compactness

**Authors:** Tianzhe Zhou, Chun Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08662v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08662v1)

**Summary:**

The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but exhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition within the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first- order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars.

## 1. Oscillating scalar field as dark matter through the cosmological epochs

**Authors:** Vladimir A. Popov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08594v1)

**Summary:**

An oscillating scalar field can behave like cold dark matter in the expanding Universe. An analog of the Jeans effect is found in a radiation-dominated era. It can prevent an overproduction of small halos for the scalars with $m\sim 10^{-13}$~eV. It is shown that although the previous treatments are valid only well inside the Hubble scale, the scalarField reproduces the CDM scenarios on the superhorizon scale and also throughout the evolution of the Universe from the beginning of the oscillations.

## 2. Regular BTZ black holes from an infinite tower of corrections

**Authors:** Pedro G. S. Fernandes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08565v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08565v1)

**Summary:**

We explore $2+1$-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived from well-defined dimensional regularizations of the Lovelock invariants. In the limit where an infinite series of corrections is included, we obtain theories that admit fully regular black hole solutions. We analyze the properties of these regular black holes, investigate geodesics in these spacetimes, and examine the tidal forces, finding they remain finite everywhere. We conclude with the conclusion that black holes are fully regular.

## 3. Acoustic black holes in BECs with an extended sonic region

**Authors:** Daniel Pe√±alver, Marco De Vito, Roberto Balbinot, Alessandro Fabbri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08564v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08564v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the modifications of the emission spectrum caused by a finite width of the sonic transition region connecting the subsonic to supersonic flow. In the context of Hawking-like radiation in sonic black holes formed by BECs we look at the effect of a narrow gap in the transition region. We find that this narrow gap can have a significant effect on the spectrum of the radiation emitted by the black hole. We also find that it has a significant impact on the formation of black holes in the universe.

## 4. Screened volume law of Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Holographic   Spontaneous Vectorization model

**Authors:** Chong-Ye Chen, Guang-Zai Ye, Peng Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08549v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08549v1)

**Summary:**

We present a holographic study of spontaneous vectorization in the background of an isotropic asymptotically AdS black brane. We demonstrate how the effective mass of the vector field drives tachyonic instability, leading to a transition from the AdS-RN phase to a vectorized phase. A central discovery is the emergence of a ``screened volume law'' in the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) These results establish spontaneous vectorized as a mechanism for generating novel entanglements structures in holographic systems, with implications for quantum information.

## 5. Dependence of post-merger properties on the thermal heating efficiency   in neutron star mergers

**Authors:** Ming-Zhe Han, Yong Gao, Kenta Kiuchi, Masaru Shibata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08514v1)

**Summary:**

We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for equal-mass binary neutron star mergers for the models varying the thermal index. We investigate the thermal effects on the merger dynamics, gravitational waves (GWs), and the dynamical mass ejection process. We find that the universal relations between NS macroscopic properties and post-merger GW frequencies are subject to non-negligible thermal uncertainties. We show that the dominant peak frequency $f_2$ of the post merger GW spectrum monotonically decreases as the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ increases.

## 6. Astrophysical constraints on the simulation hypothesis for this   Universe: why it is (nearly) impossible that we live in a simulation

**Authors:** F. Vazza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08461v1)

**Summary:**

We assess how physically realistic the ''simulation hypothesis'' for this Universe is, based on physical constraints arising from the link between information and energy. In all cases, the amounts of energy or power required by any version of the simulation hypothesis are entirely incompatible with physics, or (literally) astronomically large, even in the lowest resolution case. Only universes with very different physical properties can produce some version of this Universe as a simulation. On the other hand, our results show that it is just impossible that this universe is simulated by a universe sharing the same properties.

## 7. Perturbative Distinguishability of Black Hole Microstates from AdS/CFT   Correspondence

**Authors:** Jiaju Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08402v1)

**Summary:**

We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the short interval expansion of subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for trace distance. This result demonstrates that quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation. We present our results in the latest issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 8. Einstein ring of dust shells with quantum hair

**Authors:** Sojeong Cheong, Wontae Kim, Mungon Nam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08343v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08343v1)

**Summary:**

The information about the internal structure of a compact object is classically inaccessible to external observers. In this paper, we investigate how quantum corrections to gravitational fields can reveal theinternal structure of compact objects. Compared to the classical scenario, the deflection angle and the corresponding Einstein angle differ by a term that depends explicitly on the number of dust shells, which play the role of quantum hair. The results show that the internal structures of compact object with identical mass and radius can be distinguished by quantum hair through their lensing observables.

## 9. Numerical evolution of Maxwell's equations for wavefronts propagating   through a spherical gravitational potential

**Authors:** Annamalai P. Shanmugaraj, Erik Schnetter, Sofie Marie Koksbang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08286v1)

**Summary:**

We present a scheme for numerically solving Maxwell's equations in a weakly perturbed spacetime without introducing the usual geometric optics approximation. Using this scheme, we study light propagation through a spherical perturbation of a stationary metric in the linear limit. We find that the wavefront breaks on the gravitational potential due to the Shapiro time delay. This again leads to constructive interference, resulting in a persistent frequency dependent amplification of parts of the wave amplitude. When the wave length is shorter than a certain threshold set by the induced gravitational mass, the waves are reflected on the curvature gradient.
