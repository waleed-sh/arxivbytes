## 0. Can synchrotron radiation reveal the presence of {\it dark sector}   around black hole?

**Authors:** Marek Rogatko, Paritosh Verma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15658v1)

**Summary:**

We studied synchrotron radiation of a massive charged under visible and hidden sector groups, moving in equatorial plane around spherically symmetric weakly magnetized black hole. As a model of dark matter we choose the one, in which Maxwell field is coupled to the additional $U(1)$-gauge field envisaging the dark sector. Magnetization of a black hole also stems from Maxwell-dark photon electrodynamics. One found the radiation power and energy loss of the particle and looked for the imprints of dark Matter on those phenomena.

## 1. Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from   supersymmetric gauge theory

**Authors:** Xian-Hui Ge, Masataka Matsumoto, Kilar Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627v1)

**Summary:**

The master equation of the Proca field in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by using the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal modes duality. We establish the dictionary between the parameters in gauge and gravity theories, since both sides lead to Heun-type equations. Applying the technique of instanton counting, we analytically find the eigenfrequencies of the quasinormal mode and quasi-bound states for massive vector fields around black holes. The results show consistency with known numerical researches in the literature.

## 2. Spin precession and neutrino helicity flip in various spacetimes

**Authors:** Reza Saadati, Fayçal Hammad, Santiago Novoa-Cattivelli, Mathieu Simard, Nicolas Fleury

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15593v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15593v1)

**Summary:**

We systematically study spin precession of neutral particles freely moving in spacetime. It is found that low-energy neutrinos acquire a spin-flip probability that is as large as unity in all the spacetimes considered here. The remarkable result, however, is that while spin- flip probability for high-energy Neutrinos remains insignificant in most of these sp acetimes, some of them do allow spin-Flip probability to reach unity even for high energy neutrino.

## 3. Status of early dark energy after DESI: the role of $Ω_m$ and $r_s   H_0$

**Authors:** Jun-Qian Jiang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541v1)

**Summary:**

The EDE model is one of the promising solutions to the long-standing Hubble tension. This paper investigates the status of several EDE models in light of recent BAO observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) The DESI Y1 BAO results deviate from the CMB and Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) observations in their constraints on the matter density and the Hubble constant $r_s H_0$. Meanwhile, these Ede models happen to tend towards this deviation.

## 4. Implications of Photon Mass: Vortextrap Magnetization of Black Holes

**Authors:** Gia Dvali, Zaza N. Osmanov, Michael Zantedeschi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15510v1)

**Summary:**

Vortextrap magnetization (VTM) can generate a near-saturated magnetic field in astrophysical black holes. The extreme magnetic field is provided by a large number of Nielsen-Olesen type vortex lines piercing a black hole. The VTM mechanism neatly fits supermassive black holes with sizes matching the phenomenologically-acceptable values of the photon mass. It has implications for magnetic-field based particle acceleration. Even in absence of surrounding plasma, the VTM field is expected to result into an intense electromagnetic radiation as well as gravitational waves.

## 5. Black hole solutions in the revised Deser-Woodard nonlocal theory of   gravity

**Authors:** Rocco D'Agostino, Vittorio De Falco

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460v1)

**Summary:**

We reformulate the Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity by reformulating the related field equations within a suitable tetrad frame. We then focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum. We demonstrate that the gravitational theory under study admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse power-law correction to the Schwarzschild metric function. This work provides new insights into compact object configurations and advances our understanding of non local gravity theories in the strong-field regime at astrophysical scales.

## 6. Modeling Compact Objects in $f(R)$ Gravity: Application of Buchdahl-I   Metric with Chaplygin Equation of State

**Authors:** A. Zahra, S. A. Mardan, Muhammad Bilal Riaz, S. Saleem

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15388v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates realistic anisotropic matter configurations for spherical symmetry in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. The solutions obtained from Buchdahl-I metric are used to determine the behavior of PSR J0740+6620 and 4U 1608-52 with Starobinsky model. Analysis of physical parameters such as density, pressure, and anisotropy is illustrated through graphs. The stability of compact objects is investigated by energy and causality conditions. At the theoretical and astrophysical scales, the graphical representations validate the practical and realistic gravity models.

## 7. TemplateGeNN: Neural Networks used to accelerate Gravitational Wave   Template Bank Generation

**Authors:** Susanna Green, Andrew Lundgren

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15337v1)

**Summary:**

 TemplateGeNN is a fast stochastic template bank generation algorithm. It uses Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and a LearningMatch model (Siamese neural network) It generated a binary black hole template bank of 31,640 templates in a day on a single A100 GPU. To test the sensitivity of this template bank we injected 7746 templates into LIGO Gaussian noise. This template bank recovered 98$\%$ of the injections with a fitting factor greater than 0.97.

## 8. Primordial Black Holes

**Authors:** Bernard Carr, Florian Kuhnel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15279v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15279v1)

**Summary:**

In this chapter we first describe the early history of primordial black hole (PBH) research. We then discuss their possible formation mechanisms, including critical collapse from inflationary fluctuations and various types of phase transition. We next describe the numerous constraints on the number density of PBHs from various quantum and astrophysical processes. We end by discussing this evidence, with particular emphasis on their role as dark matter candidates, sources of gravitational waves and seeds for supermassive black holes and early cosmic structures.

## 9. The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$   and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves

**Authors:** Shin'ichi Nojiri, Sergei D. Odintsov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272v1)

**Summary:**

This talk is based on the collaboration with Sergei D. Odintsov. We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T) and $F (Q)$.

## 10. Entropy correction and quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like   black hole in bumblebee gravity

**Authors:** Ningthoujam Media, Y. Priyobarta Singh, Y. Onika Laxmi, T. Ibungochouba Singh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15268v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the tunneling of fermion particle for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like (KNdS-like) black hole in bumblebee gravity model. We use the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) to study the Hawking temperature of the black hole. The significant impact on the greybody factor, Hawking spectra and sparsity of Hawking radiation are also studied in the presence of Lorentz violating parameter L. The quasinormal modes for scalar perturbation is investigated using WKB method and P\"oschl-Teller fitting method.

## 11. Physical validity of anisotropic models derived from isotropic fluid   dynamics in $f(R,T)$ theory: An implication of gravitational decoupling

**Authors:** Tayyab Naseer, G. Mustafa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15150v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15150v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we derive multiple anisotropic analogs from the established isotropic model by means of the gravitational decoupling approach. We adopt the Heintzmann's ansatz and some constraints on extra gravitating source to deal with the first and second systems of equations, respectively. By utilizing the preliminary information of a star candidate LMC X-4, we assess the physical validity of the developed models. Our analysis indicates that both our models exhibit characteristics which are well-agreed with the acceptability criteria for certain parametric values.

## 12. The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for   the CMB primordial spectra

**Authors:** Sidan A, Tom Banks

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108v1)

**Summary:**

Banks and Zurek use the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. Their conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems. The predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.
