## 0. Effects of Spatial Curvature on Blackbody Radiation: Modifications to   Energy Distribution and Fundamental Laws

**Authors:** Somayeh Kourkinejat, Ali Mahdifar, Ehsan Amooghorban

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03208v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the effects of spatial curvature on blackbody radiation. By employing an analog model of general relativity, we replace the conventional straight-line harmonic oscillators with oscillators on a circle. We find that moving from flat to curved space results in a reduction in both the height and width of the Planck function. Increasing the curvature leads to a pronounced redshift in the peak frequency. We also analyze the influence of spatial curvature on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Rayleigh-Jeans law, and Wien law.

## 1. Velocity Addition/Subtraction in Special Relativity

**Authors:** Domenico Giulini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03149v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper we re-derive velocity addition/subtraction in Special Relativity. We offer a less familiar alternative geometric view that leads to an invariant definition of the concept of relative velocity between two states of motion. We also offer an elementary proof that does not seem to be widely known in the relativity literature. Finally we compare this to the corresponding geometric definitions in Galilei-Newton spacetime, emphasising similarities and differences. The paper is published by Springer in the form of a book.

## 2. On the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences in the inflationary   angular power spectrum

**Authors:** Adrian del Rio, Jose Navarro-Salas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03125v1)

**Summary:**

We revise the role that ultraviolet divergences of quantum fields play in slow-roll inflation. We discuss the renormalization of cosmological observables from a space-time perspective. This may change significantly the predictions for $C_{\ell}$, while maintaining scale invariance. We further argue that renormalizing at second ``adiabatic'' order may be more appropriate from the viewpoint of standard quantum field theory. We then analyze the ultraviolet behavior, and point out that the standard result in the literature is equivalent to a renormalisation of $C _C_C$ at zero.

## 3. Cosmic Whispers of the Early Universe: Gravitational Waves and Dark   Matter from Primordial Black Holes

**Authors:** Antonio Junior Iovino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03065v1)

**Summary:**

 Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compact objects that might make up all or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today. Their formation and existence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) These waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Collaboration or account for signals detected by pulsar timing array experiments (PTA) In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the PBH scenario, examining the computation of the abundance beyond the Gaussian paradigm. In the second part, we discuss how PBH formation can produce a stochastic GW background.

## 4. Surrogate modeling of gravitational waves microlensed by spherically   symmetric potentials

**Authors:** Uddeepta Deka, Gopalkrishna Prabhu, Md Arif Shaikh, Shasvath J. Kapadia, Vijay Varma, Scott E. Field

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02974v1)

**Summary:**

The anticipated observation of the gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves (GWs) promises to shed light on a host of astrophysical and cosmological questions. extracting the parameters of the lens from the modulated GWs requires accurate modeling. Analytic solutions to the lens equation have not been found to date, except for a handful of simplistic lens models. We show that surrogate modeling is a powerful tool to make large-scale parameter estimation in the context of microlensed GWs practicable.

## 5. Isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced by   cosmological soliton isocurvature perturbations

**Authors:** Di Luo, Yan-Heng Yu, Jun-Peng Li, Sai Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02965v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02965v1)

**Summary:**

Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. We investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropic signals. detection of both the background and the anis tropies could reveal important implications for the soliton as well as the early universe.. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Gravitational Waves.

## 6. Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$

**Authors:** Carlo Heissenberg

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904v1)

**Summary:**

The contribution to the angular momentum loss for two-body scattering involving two radiation modes is determined by the radiation-reaction contribution. The latter is proportional to the tree-level one, and this reduces the calculation of $J_\text{2rad}$ to cut two-loop integrals. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J-2rad$ for generic velocities. This expression resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.

## 7. On the Polynomial Degeneracy of Ricci Invariants and Spacetime   Singularity

**Authors:** Soumya Chakrabarti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02903v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the connection of a general relativistic matter-energy momentum tensor with the polynomial degeneracies of higher order curvature invariants defined in Riemannian geometry. The degeneracies enforce additional constraints on the energy-momentum tensor components. Due to these constraints the formation of a curvature singularity can no longer be treated as inevitable. We find that there can be a formation of singularity iff the interior fluid evolves into (i) a pressure-less dust, (ii) an isotropic sphere or (iii) a distribution with negative pressure.

## 8. Revisiting the Chern-Simons interaction during inflation with a   non-canonical pseudo-scalar

**Authors:** Jun'ya Kume, Marco Peloso, Nicola Bartolo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02890v1)

**Summary:**

A Chern-Simons interaction between a pseudo-scalar field and a U(1) gauge field results in the generation of a chiral gravitational wave background. The detection of this signal is contrasted by the fact that this coupling also generates primordial scalar perturbations, on which strong limits exist, particularly at CMB scales. In this study, we propose a new extension of this mechanism characterized by a non-canonical kinetic term for the pseudo-Scalar.

## 9. Thermal RG Flow of AS Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** E. Nyergesy, I. G. Márián, E. Meskhi, Y. Turovtsi-Shiutev, I. Nandori

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02878v1)

**Summary:**

We perform the thermal Renormalization Group (RG) study of the Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. Quantum effects are taken into account by moving along the thermal RG trajectory with fixed value of $tau$ producing the quantum effective action at a given dimensionless temperature. Only the symmetric phase of AS gravity survives at the high temperature limit ($\tau = \infty) which means that only the symmetrical phase survives at $k_T$

## 10. Holographic inflation and holographic dark energy from entropy of the   anti-de Sitter black hole

**Authors:** Qihong Huang, He Huang, Bing Xu, Kaituo Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02759v1)

**Summary:**

A new holographic dark energy model has been proposed. When the Hubble horizon and particle horizon are chosen as the IR cutoff, the late-time accelerated expansion of universe is realized. We find that slow-roll inflation with the chaotic potential is favored by Planck results for some special cases, such as $n=1/3$ and $n =1/2. Our results indicate that when $b^{2}$ takes a small value, this model cannot be distinguished from the standard $Lambda$CDM model and can serve as an alternative.

## 11. Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned

**Authors:** Koji Yamaguchi, Achim Kempf

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02757v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02757v1)

**Summary:**

 encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. A possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage. Beyond applications in cryptography, encrypted cloning could provide a form of redundancy, parallelism, fault tolerance or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden.

## 12. The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in   Inclined Orbits

**Authors:** Huan-rong Yuan, Ying Wang, Xin Wu, Ji-wei Xie, Hui-gen Liu, Ji-lin Zhou, Wei Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02717v1)

**Summary:**

Several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin- orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results can be applied without restriction.

## 13. Black hole surrounded by a magnetic vortex in $f(R)$ gravity

**Authors:** F. C. E. Lima, C. A. S. Almeida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02712v1)

**Summary:**

 Modified Gravity Theories (MGTs) are extensions of General Relativity (GR) in its standard formulation. In the case of linear $f(R)$ gravity derived from quantum metric fluctuations, one shows the existence of a three-dimensional ring-like BH-vortex system with quantized magnetic flux. Unlike the standard theory of Maxwell-Higgs vortices in flat spacetime, the vortice suffer the influence of the BH's event horizon. This interaction induces perturbations in the magnetic vortex profile, forming cosmological ring- like magnetic structures.
