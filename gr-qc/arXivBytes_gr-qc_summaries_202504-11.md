## 0. One-loop renormalization of the effective field theory of inflationary   fluctuations from gravitational interactions

**Authors:** Matteo Braglia, Lucas Pinol

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07926v1)

**Summary:**

We study one-loop corrections to primordial power spectra generated during cosmic inflation from gravitational nonlinear interactions. In the realm of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of inflationary fluctuations, we renormalize the quadratic Lagrangian dictating the linear dynamics of gauge-invariant perturbations. We show that time-dependent Ultra-Violet (UV) divergences appearing at the loop level can be canceled at all times. We discuss a first application to multifield inflation.

## 1. Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit of axisymmetric   spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes

**Authors:** Takahisa Igata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static, axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects. We also express these coefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 2. Large black-hole scalar charges induced by cosmology in Horndeski   theories

**Authors:** Eugeny Babichev, Gilles Esposito-Farèse, Ignacy Sawicki, Leonardo G. Trombetta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07882v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07882v1)

**Summary:**

The regularity of black hole solutions, embedded in an expanding Universe, is studied in a subclass of Horndeski theories. We find that in presence of a time derivative of the scalar field, driven by the cosmological expansion, this regularity generically imposes large scalar charges for black holes. This phenomenon, together with the Vainshtein screening typical of these theories, strongly suppresses observable scalar effects. We show that this full class of models is consistent with LIGO/Virgo detections of gravitational waves.

## 3. Sculpting the outer edge of accretion disks in pre-circumbinary binary   black hole systems

**Authors:** Fabien Casse, Peggy Varniere, Léna Arthur, Fabrice Dodu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07880v1)

**Summary:**

Binary black hole systems (BBHs) have become a vivid reality in astrophysics as stellar-mass black hole mergers are now detected through their related gravitational wave emission during the merger stage. The structure of these systems prior to the formation of the CBD remains mostly unexplored. The aim of the present article is to investigate the potential modifications induced by the presence of a secondary black hole onto the structure of the accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole. We performed 2D classical hydrodynamical simulations of a pre-CBD BBH while taking into account all gravitational effects.

## 4. Quintessence models in the late Universe

**Authors:** L. K. Duchaniya, Jackson Levi Said, B. Mishra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07876v1)

**Summary:**

Scalar-tensor theories have shown great potential in inducing tailored modifications to cosmic evolution. We center the action of these models in the late Universe which leaves early $\Lambda$CDM cosmology unchanged. The effects show the potential of producing a faster expanding cosmology with a high Hubble constant. The models are constrained using the cosmic chronometer data, Pantheon plus, and transversal baryonic acoustic oscillation data. The results are published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 5. Resummation of Universal Tails in Gravitational Waveforms

**Authors:** Mikhail M. Ivanov, Yue-Zhou Li, Julio Parra-Martinez, Zihan Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07862v1)

**Summary:**

We present a formula for the universal anomalous scaling of the multipole moments of a generic gravitating source in classical general relativity. We use the absorption of low frequency gravitational waves by a black hole to identify the total multipole scaling dimension. We propose a novel resummation of the universal short-distance logarithms (''tails'') in the gravitational waveform of binary systems, which may improve the modeling of signals from current and future gravitational wave experiments. The universality of the point-particle effective description of compact gravitating systems further allows us to extract the universal part of the anomalous dimension.

## 6. Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a   non-zero potential

**Authors:** Gabriel I. Róis, José Tarciso S. S. Junior, Francisco S. N. Lobo, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861v1)

**Summary:**

In-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity, such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. The analysis uncovers a range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case.

## 7. Large anisotropies in the gravitational wave background from   baryogenesis

**Authors:** Yan-Heng Yu, Sai Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07838v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07838v1)

**Summary:**

Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis can produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field. The field generally fragments into Q-balls, whose rapid decay induces enhanced gravitational waves. In this Letter, we investigate the anisotropies in this gravitational wave background as a new essential observable for AD baryogenic. We present that the an isotropies can be significantly large with a reduced angular power spectrum and can be detected by future experiments.

## 8. Signatures of NED on Quasi periodic Oscillations of a Magnetically   Charged Black Hole

**Authors:** Bidyut Hazarika, Mrinnoy M. Gohain, Prabwal Phukon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole. Starting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular orbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find that as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards the Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies.

## 9. The effect of background matter on the spin oscillations of neutrinos   scattered by the supermassive black hole

**Authors:** Mridupawan Deka, Maxim Dvornikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07816v1)

**Summary:**

We study spin oscillations of neutrinos in relativistic moving matter inside an accretion disk. These neutrino are gravitationally scattered off a spinning Kerr black hole. The disk can co-rotate and counter-rotated with respect to BH spin. We perform numerical simulations of the propagation of a large number of incoming test neut rinos. We briefly discuss our results. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Radioactivity and Particle Physics.

## 10. Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the   Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture

**Authors:** Chunyu Li, Junkai Wang, Dongdong Zhang, Emmanuel N. Saridakis, Yi-Fu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791v1)

**Summary:**

Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration. Our findings imply that viable dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.

## 11. Bondi Mass, Memory Effect And Balance Law of Polyhomogeneous Spacetime

**Authors:** Xiaokai He, Xiaoning Wu, Naqing Xie

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07774v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07774v1)

**Summary:**

Spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of a combination of powers of 1/r and ln r are known as polyhomogeneous spacetimes. The asymptotic behaviour of the Newman-Penrose quantities is presented under certain gauges. The Bondi mass is revisited via the Iyer-Wald formalism. It is found that the appearance of the logarithmic terms does not affect the balance law and it remains unchanged as the one of spacetime with metrics.

## 12. Thermodynamics of Reissner-nordstorm black bounce black hole

**Authors:** Feba C Joy, R Tharanath

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07730v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07730v1)

**Summary:**

Our study focuses on the thermodynamics of Reissner-nordstorm black bounce black hole. We have determined the thermodynamic parameters including entropy, mass, temperature, heat capacity and free energies. We additionally focused on the P V isotherm and the logarithmic correction to the entropy. We investigated how those parameters are related to entropy and for some insights we additionally focused. on the P V isotherm and the logrithmic corrections to the entropy.

## 13. Singularity resolution and inflation from an infinite tower of   regularized curvature corrections

**Authors:** Pedro G. S. Fernandes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07692v1)

**Summary:**

We explore four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories obtained from well-defined dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. When an infinite tower of corrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in which the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the early-universe. They also admit a specific class of regular black hole solutions. We present our results in a paper published in the Journal of Theoretical Physics. For more information, visit www.jph.org.

## 14. Perihelion precession in non-Newtonian central potentials

**Authors:** Michele Andreoli

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07690v1)

**Summary:**

High order corrections to the perihelion precession are obtained in non-Newtonian central potentials, via complex analysis techniques. The result is an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form, are calculated in closed form. To validate the method, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are compared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the Schwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out for the case where s=4.

## 15. The Cosmological Evidence for Non-Minimal Coupling

**Authors:** William J. Wolf, Carlos García-García, Theodore Anton, Pedro G. Ferreira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679v1)

**Summary:**

Recent observational evidence of deviations from the $Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a field. We find that the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2<0$

## 16. Tidal heating in binary inspiral of strange quark stars

**Authors:** Suprovo Ghosh, José Luis Hernández, Bikram Keshari Pradhan, Cristina Manuel, Debarati Chatterjee, Laura Tolos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07659v1)

**Summary:**

Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated that hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. We find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $ 0.5$ radians for strange quarks of 200 MeV.

## 17. An intrinsic cosmological observer

**Authors:** Antony J. Speranza

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07630v1)

**Summary:**

There has been much recent interest in the necessity of an observer degree of freedom in the description of local algebras in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we describe an example where the observer can be constructed intrinsically from the quantum fields. This leads to a decomposition of the gravitational algebra into quantum field and observer degrees of freedom, with different choices of observer being related to changes in a quantum reference frame for the algebra. The arguments in this work involve various properties of automorphism groups of hyperfinite factors, and so in an appendix we review the structure of these groups, which may be of independent interest.

## 18. Parameter extraction of the stochastic gravitational wave background   with peak-like templates in millihertz

**Authors:** Heng-Sen Jiao, Hong-Bo Jin, Yun-Long Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07602v1)

**Summary:**

Using templates from the early universe, we demonstrate that the peak-like templates outperform the broken power law (BPL) templates in power-law exponents recovery and peak frequency localization. The reconstruction results obtained using data from Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are better than those obtained using Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) which is based on the spectrogram. Nevertheless, transient signals exhibit a detrimental impact on parameter estimation precision, causing errors to increase by an order of magnitude. This framework provides an example for using templates to analyze data from space-based gravitational wave detectors.

## 19. Post-Newtonian dynamics of compact binaries with mass transfer

**Authors:** Zi-Han Zhang, Tan Liu, Zong-Kuan Guo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07563v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07563v1)

**Summary:**

Taking into account the mass transfer effect, we derive the equations of motion of a compact binary system at the second-half post-Newtonian order. We obtain the time derivative of the orbital frequency, which is consistent with the angular momentum balance equation. Numerical estimates of the phase of gravitational waves are provided for typical mass transfer rates. Our result can be used to improve the waveforms of gravitational wave emitted by compact binaries with mass transfer. The study was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.

## 20. Regular Black Hole Models in the Transition from Baryonic Matter to   Quark Matter

**Authors:** Vitalii Vertogradov, Ali Övgün

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07561v1)

**Summary:**

Standard gravitational collapse models inevitably predict central singularities, highlighting the limitations of classical general relativity in extreme density regimes. By introducing a physically motivated, inhomogeneous transition rate between baryonic and quark matter, we demonstrate it is possible to construct regular black hole solutions featuring a nonsingular de Sitter-like core. We further analyze the observable consequences of these models, particularly emphasizing modifications to the black hole shadow radius, which provide direct observational constraints accessible through Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements.

## 21. Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting   solar-type stars

**Authors:** Vitorio A. De Lorenci, David I. Kaiser, Patrick Peter, Lucas S. Ruiz, Noah E. Wolfe

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBHs) are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. The magnitude of the waves could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from aPBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star.

## 22. Large amplitude mechanical coherent states and detection of weak   nonlinearities in cavity optomechanics

**Authors:** Wenlin Li, Paolo Piergentili, Francesco Marzioni, Michele Bonaldi, Antonio Borrielli, Enrico Serra, Francesco Marin, Francesco Marino, Nicola Malossi, Riccardo Natali, Giovanni Di Giuseppe, David Vitali

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07486v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07486v1)

**Summary:**

The generation of large-amplitude coherent states of a massive mechanical resonator can be useful tools for quantum sensing and for testing fundamental physics theories. Any weak perturbation may affect the coherent quantum evolution of the prepared state, providing a sensitive probe. We consider different strategies, first focusing on the stationary dynamics in the presence of multiple tones driving the system, and then focusing on non-equilibrium dynamical strategies. These methods can be successfully applied for measuring Duffing-like material nonlinearities or effective nonlinear corrections associated with quantum gravity theories.

## 23. Through the Looking-Glass, and What AdS Found There: quantum particle   production with a Whittaker spectrum

**Authors:** Michael R. R. Good, Eric V. Linder

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07458v1)

**Summary:**

Parity-inverted anti-de Sitter space -- ''flipped AdS'' -- is studied through the accelerating boundary correspondence of a moving mirror trajectory. The particle production exhibits positive energy flux and a finite total energy (both unlike AdS). The particle spectrum is of Whittaker form, with some similarities to a Planck thermal spectrum. We also derive the corresponding spacetime metric, with similarities to regular de Sitterspace, but exhibiting a tower of repeated causal regions with horizons.
