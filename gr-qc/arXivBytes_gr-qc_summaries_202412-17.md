## 0. There is more to the de Sitter horizon than just the area

**Authors:** Willy Fischler, Hare Krishna, Sarah Racz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12097v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12097v1)

**Summary:**

The de Sitter cosmological horizon encodes more information about the bulk spacetime than just the entropy. We show that the horizon contains all of the gauge invariant information about (static albeit unstable) configurations of charged and rotating objects. We study highly symmetric objects, such as dipoles and cubes, built of objects with electric charge and angular momentum at their vertices. These configurations affect the geometry of the horizon and imprint detailed information on the objects in the bulk onto the horizon.

## 1. Mitigating cosmic variance in the Hellings-Downs curve: a Cosmic   Microwave Background analogy

**Authors:** Cyril Pitrou, Giulia Cusin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12073v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12073v1)

**Summary:**

The Hellings-Downs correlation characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) This approach closely follows the theoretical framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB experiments. We show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T>4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation.

## 2. Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals in gravity: $\varepsilon$-factorized form   for apparent singularities

**Authors:** Hjalte Frellesvig, Roger Morales, Sebastian Pögel, Stefan Weinzierl, Matthias Wilhelm

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12057v1)

**Summary:**

We study a recently identified four-loop Feynman integral that contains a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometry. It contributes to the scattering of black holes in classical gravity at fifth post-Minkowskian and second self-force order (5PM 2SF) in the conservative sector. We introduce an appropriate ansatz which allows us to bring such cases into an $\varepsilon$-factorized form. As a proof of principle, we apply it to the integral at hand.

## 3. QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological   Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow

**Authors:** Ning Bao, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Zhihan Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045v1)

**Summary:**

Non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries can be expressed as quantum path integrals in one higher dimension. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS and topological holography.

## 4. Black hole solutions in theories of supergravity

**Authors:** Tomás Ortín

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12020v1)

**Summary:**

Supergravity has played a very important role in many advances and developments in black hole physics. Here I will review the history of some of the most important developments in the field of supergravity. I will also look at the role played by black holes in the development of the theory of gravity and black holes. I hope that this will help you understand some of these developments better.

## 5. Horndeski in motion

**Authors:** J. Bayron Orjuela-Quintana, Jose Beltrán Jiménez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12018v1)

**Summary:**

We study a class of homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies within the family of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. The momentum density of these configurations exhibits a universal evolution and an additional component with non-vanishing momentum density is required to have non-trivial effects. We analyse in more detail the case of Kinetic Gravity Braiding with emphasis on its application to moving dark energy models and its effects on large scale dark flows as well as the CMB dipole and quadrupole.

## 6. Wormholes from beyond

**Authors:** Juliano C. S. Neves

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11947v1)

**Summary:**

In a brane-world context, our universe would be a four-dimensional brane embedded into a five-dimensional spacetime or bulk. In this article, the Morris-Thorne wormhole and the Molina-Neves wormhole are obtained on the brane using the Nakas-Kanti approach. From the bulk perspective, these wormholes are five- dimensional solutions supported by an exotic fluid, but from the branes perspective, such objects are wormholes not supported by any fields or particles that live on the four- dimensional spacetime.

## 7. Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier   Space

**Authors:** Serena Valtolina, Rutger van Haasteren

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894v1)

**Summary:**

Recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data.

## 8. Solutions to the mode equation for a quantized massless scalar field   outside a black hole that forms from the collapse of a null shell: Late-time   behaviors and computation of the stress-energy tensor

**Authors:** Shohreh Gholizadeh Siahmazgi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11848v1)

**Summary:**

In four dimensions, a spacetime is considered in which a black hole forms from the collapse of a spherically symmetric null shell. The Unruh state is designed to be a state that mimics the late-time behaviors of quantized fields that Hawking predicted for the black holes that form from collapse. Evidence is provided that some of the modes of the quantum fields and the symmetric two-point function are determined by infrared effects. A method is developed to compute the semi-classical stress-energy tensor for a massless minimally-coupled scalar field in the $in$ vacuum state.

## 9. Gravitational waves from regular black holes in extreme mass-ratio   inspirals

**Authors:** Shailesh Kumar, Tieguang Zi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11847v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11847v1)

**Summary:**

In the present article, we consider the eccentric equatorial motion of an inspiralling object in the background of a rotating regular black hole. The dynamics generate gravitational waves that imply a loss in energy and angular momentum of the orbiting body. We generate the gravitational waveforms and constrain the non-Kerr parameter through dephasing and mismatch computations using Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations. The estimates of our analysis with EMRIs present the possible detectability of Kerr-like geometries with future space-based detectors.

## 10. Classification uncertainty for transient gravitational-wave noise   artefacts with optimised conformal prediction

**Authors:** Ann-Kristin Malz, Gregory Ashton, Nicolo Colombo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11801v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11801v1)

**Summary:**

Conformal Prediction (CP) is a framework to provide such uncertainty quantifications for ML point predictors. CP makes use of a score function, a nonconformity measure, to convert an algorithm's heuristic notion of uncertainty to a rigorous uncertainty. We use the application on Gravity Spy to explore the performance of different nonconforming measures and optimise them for our application. Our results show that the optimal nonconformsity measure depends on the specific application, as well as the metric used to quantify the performance.

## 11. Inferring additional physics through unmodelled signal reconstructions

**Authors:** Rimo Das, V. Gayathri, Divyajyoti, Sijil Jose, Imre Bartos, Sergey Klimenko, Chandra Kant Mishra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11749v1)

**Summary:**

 Parameter estimation of gravitational wave data is often computationally expensive. Sub-dominant effects like orbital eccentricity may provide crucial insights into the formation channels of compact binary mergers. We present a pipeline strategy leveraging minimally modelled waveform reconstruction to identify the presence of eccentricity in real time. Our method enables low-latency inferences of binary properties supporting targeted follow-up analyses and can be applied to identify any physical effect of measurable strength. We demonstrate that ignoring eccentricity leads to significant biases in parameter recovery, including chirp mass estimates falling outside the 90% credible interval.

## 12. Symmetric Teleparallel Connection and Spherical Solutions in Newer GR

**Authors:** Manuel Hohmann, Vasiliki Karanasou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11730v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11730v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we focus on symmetric teleparallel gravity. This is a modification of General Relativity where gravity is described by the non-metricity of an affine connection, whose curvature and torsion vanish. We find two families of vacuum solutions that correspond to some exotic objects and we study their properties. In particular, we investigate the possibility of having a traversable wormhole, we compute the Komar mass and we discuss the conditions for asymptotic flatness.

## 13. Induced gravity and cosmological principle

**Authors:** V. A. Berezin, I. D. Ivanova, A. E. Kuprina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11655v1)

**Summary:**

It appears that the source terms with the particle number density in the creation law can be interpreted as the invisible part of the Universe. It is shown that there is a gauge that restores the General Relativity in which our model is equivalent to the $f(R)$-gravity for $f \propto R^{\frac{3}{2}}$ The theory of induced gravity is based on the theory of quantum gravity. The theory is consistent with the idea that the universe is expanding at a rate of one billion times the speed of light.
