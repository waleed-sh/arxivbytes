## 0. Non-Null Torus Knotted Gravitational Waves from Gravitoelectromagnetism

**Authors:** R. S. Facundo, I. V. Vancea

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10347v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we construct a non-null torus-knotted gravitational monochromatic wave solution of the linearized Einstein equations in vacuum. We employ the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) framework by analogy with classical electrodynamics. We investigate two properties inherent to this solution due to its GEM origin: the dual GEM potential and GEM helicity. We derive the line element, the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor and the geodesic equation for this background.

## 1. Hamiltonians to all Orders in Perturbation Theory and Higher Loop   Corrections in Single Field Inflation with PBHs Formation

**Authors:** Hassan Firouzjahi, Bahar Nikbakht

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10287v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate the action and the interaction Hamiltonians to all orders in perturbation theory in the model of single field inflation with a transient ultra slow-roll phase. Employing the formalism of EFT of inflation, we obtain a compact non-perturbative expression for the interaction. Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field in the decoupling limit. We also present a non-linear relation between the curvature perturbations and the cosmological correlators and loop corrections.

**Authors:** William Giarè, Tariq Mahassen, Eleonora Di Valentino, Supriya Pan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10264v1)

**Summary:**

Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and distance moduli from Type Ia supernovae suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) scenarios. This focused review assesses its robustness across independent measurements and surveys. Overall, our findings highlight that combinations that include PantheonPlus SN and SDSS BAO significantly weaken the preference for DDE. However, intriguing hints supporting DDE emerge in combinations that do not include DESI-BAO measurements.

## 3. Spacetime curvature corrections for the Yukawa potential and its   application for the Reissner-Nordström Metric

**Authors:** J. V. Zamperlini, C. C. Barros Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10247v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spacetime curvature on the Yukawa potential. Using the Bunch-Parker propagator expansion within Born's first approximation, we derive a Yukawa-like potential in a curved spacetime. We analyze the impact of the curvatures on the propagator in momentum space, revealing modifications to the potential and showing that the corrections are determined by geometric quantities from Einstein's equations, like the Ricci scalar and tensor. We illustrate this using the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, highlighting the corrections' magnitude for specific parameters.

## 4. Deep learning-based holography for T-linear resistivity

**Authors:** Byoungjoon Ahn, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Chang-Woo Ji, Keun-Young Kim, Kwan Yun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10245v1)

**Summary:**

We employ deep learning within holographic duality to investigate $T$-linear resistivity, a hallmark of strange metals. We also explore the impact of the resistivity slope on dilaton potentials. Our findings suggest that deep learning could help uncover mechanisms in holographic condensed matter systems and advance our understanding ofStrange metals. The research was published in the journal of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, New York City (PNAS) (http://www.pnas.org)

## 5. Stimulated emission or absorption of gravitons by light

**Authors:** Ralf Schützhold

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10221v1)

**Summary:**

In the presence of a gravitational wave, we find that it should be possible to observe signatures of stimulated emission or absorption of gravitons with present day technology. Non-classical photon states may improve the sensitivity and might even allow us to test certain quantum aspects of the gravitational field. We study the exchange of energy between gravitational and electromagnetic waves in a Sagnac type geometry, in analogy to an ``optical Weber bar.'' The study could also be used as a complementary detection scheme.

## 6. Test fields and naked singularities: is the second law the cosmic   censor?

**Authors:** Si-Jiang Yang, Zheng-Quan Cui, Shao-Wen Wei, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10133v1)

**Summary:**

It has been claimed that a Kerr-Newman black hole can generically be overspun by neutral test fields. Even when backreactions are taken into account, the black hole could still be destroyed. In this paper, we revisit the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We show that a test scalar field and neutrino field near the event horizon can't overspin an extremal Kerr- newman. But they can overspin it if they violate the second law of black hole thermodynamics.

## 7. Comparison of definitions of angular momentum at null infinity

**Authors:** Szymon Bagiński, Jacek Jezierski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10105v1)

**Summary:**

Supertranslation ambiguity of angular momentum at null infinity creates a technical difficulty in choosing the proper definition for this conserved quantity. Many different approaches are found in the literature. This article aims to review the most relevant of these notions and compare their most significant properties. A new definition of angular Momentum at Null infinity is also proposed, which is supertranslation invariant under certain assumptions. It is proposed that this new definition is also supertranslation invariant under certain assumptions.

## 8. Quantum Schwarzschild-(A)dS Black Holes: Unitarity and Singularity   Resolution

**Authors:** Steffen Gielen, Sofie Ried

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10104v1)

**Summary:**

In unimodular gravity the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant analogous to a total energy. We discuss self-adjoint extensions of the Schr\"odinger-like Hamiltonian arising from the requirement of unitarity. For semiclassical states we are able to derive analytical expressions for expectation values of the metric. This represents a quantum-corrected, nonsingular extension of the classical Schwarzschild-(A)dS geometry which describes a quantum transition between asymptotic black hole and white hole states.

## 9. The implications of stochastic gas torques for asymmetric binaries in   the LISA band

**Authors:** Lorenzo Copparoni, Lorenzo Speri, Laura Sberna, Andrea Derdzinski, Enrico Barausse

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10087v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves from asymmetric mass-ratio black-hole binaries carry unique information about their astrophysical environment. For instance, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna could potentially measure the amplitude and slope of gas torques in binaries embedded in the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei. However, this relies on simplified analytic models, which do not account for the stochastic variability of torques seen in hydrodynamic simulations. This work moves towards a more realistic assessment of one of the LISA science objectives, i.e., probing the properties of the astrophysical environments of black holes.

## 10. Complex degenerate metrics in general relativity: a covariant extension   of the Moore-Penrose algorithm

**Authors:** Arthur Garnier, Emmanuele Battista

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10053v1)

**Summary:**

The Moore-Penrose algorithm provides a generalized notion of an inverse. Remarkably, the degenerate nature of the metric can be given a geometrical representation in terms of a torsion tensor. Applications of the new scheme to complex black hole geometries and cosmological models are also investigated. Relevance of our findings to quantum gravity and quantum cosmology is finally discussed.

## 11. Generalized Uncertainty Principle mimicking dynamical Dark Energy:   matter perturbations and gravitational wave data analysis

**Authors:** Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano, Yassine Sekhmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10043v1)

**Summary:**

The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) stands out as a nearly ubiquitous feature in quantum gravity modeling. We examine the growth of matter perturbations and structure formation employing the Top-Hat Spherical Collapse approach. Our analysis reveals that the profile of the density contrast is sensitive to the GUP parameter $\beta$, resulting in a slower gravitational evolution of primordial fluctuations in the matter density. We also discuss implications for the relic density of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying the parameter space that enhances the PGW spectrum.

## 12. Linking Analytic Light Curve Models to Physical Properties of Kilonovae

**Authors:** Ayari Kitamura, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Masaomi Tanaka, Sho Fujibayashi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10021v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10021v1)

**Summary:**

In binary neutron star mergers, dynamical ejecta and post-merger ejecta have been often linked to the red and blue kilonova emission. But light curve modeling often results in the ejecta parameters that are at odds with such expectations. This suggests that the parameters derived from light. curve modeling with an analytic model do not represent the true configuration of the kilon.ova ejecta. We show that the estimate of the total ejecta mass is rather robust within a factor of a few, reflecting the total luminosity output.

## 13. The information loss problem and Hawking radiation as tunneling

**Authors:** Baocheng Zhang, Christian Corda, Qing-yu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09924v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we review some methods that tried to solve the information loss problem. We revisit the solution based on Hawking radiation as tunneling, and provide a detailed statistical interpretation on the black hole entropy. In addition, we show that black hole evaporation is governed by a time-dependent Schrodinger equation that sends pure states into pure states rather than into mixed states. This is further confirmation of the fact that black Hole evporation is unitary. The paper is published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 14. Minimax surfaces and the holographic entropy cone

**Authors:** Brianna Grado-White, Guglielmo Grimaldi, Matthew Headrick, Veronika E. Hubeny

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09894v1)

**Summary:**

We study and prove properties of the minimax formulation of the HRT holographic entanglement entropy formula. The formula involves finding the maximal-area surface on a timelike hypersurface, or time-sheet. The minimax prescription suggests a way to construct a graph model for time-dependent states, a weighted graph on which min cuts compute HRT entropies. Our construction of a graphmodel relies on the time-sheets obeying a certain ``cooperating'' property, which we show holds in some examples.
