## 0. Dynamical tides in neutron stars with first-order phase transitions: the   role of the discontinuity mode

**Authors:** Jonas P. Pereira, Lucas Tonetto, Michał Bejger, J. Leszek Zdunik, Paweł Haensel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16911v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16911v1)

**Summary:**

Dynamical tides induced in each star by its companion become significant and should be included in complete gravitational-wave (GW) modeling. We investigate the coupling between the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that the discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) can rival the contribution of the fundamental $f$- mode. These results show the importance of dynamical tides to probe neutron stars' equation of state, and to test the existence of dense-matter phase transitions.

## 1. Exact analytic solutions in 2+1 Hořava gravity with cosmological   constant

**Authors:** Jorge Bellorín, Claudio Bórquez, Byron Droguett

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16895v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the static solutions with rotational symmetry in the nonprojectable Ho\v{r}ava theory in 2+1 dimensions. We consider all inequivalent terms of the effective theory, including the cosmological constant. We find two distinct types of solutions: the first one corresponds to a Lifshitz solution, while the second one is obtained through a coordinate transformation of the equations of motion. This exact solution does not exhibit Lifshitzer behavior and features a naked singularity.

## 2. Hint towards inconsistency between BAO and Supernovae Dataset: The   Evidence of Redshift Evolving Dark Energy from DESI DR2 is Absent

**Authors:** Samsuzzaman Afroz, Suvodip Mukherjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16868v1)

**Summary:**

The presence of unknown systematics present in differrent datasets can lead to a biased inference of the cosmological parameters. We find that these datasets violate the distance duality relation and show a signature of redshift evolution. Coincidentally this effect mimics a redshift evolving dark energy scenario when supernovae dataset and DESI datasets are combined. This indicates that the current conclusion from DESI DR2 in combination with Pantheon$+$ is likely due to the combination of two inconsistent datasets.

## 3. Modeling a Non-Singular Universe with Late-Time Acceleration through a   Novel Inhomogeneous Barotropic Equation of State

**Authors:** Rajdeep Mazumdar, Mrinnoy M. Gohain, Kalyan Bhuyan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16826v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigated the effects of incorporating barotropic fluids on cosmological solutions within the general relativity framework. Our goal is to explore if this type of EoS might help explain the universe's development, concentrating on the scenario where the universe bounces instead of singularities. Interestingly the generic solutions derived from our model are sufficiently adaptable to illustrate the bounce scenario, cosmic inflation and late-time dark-energy behaviour. We investigated several elements of cosmic development, including as the energy density, deceleration parameter, and energy conditions.

## 4. Supersymmetric Warped Solutions from Type IIB Orientifold Reduction

**Authors:** S. Maurelli, R. Noris, M. Oyarzo, H. Samtleben, M. Trigiante

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16822v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a family of supersymmetric solutions in Type IIB supergravity of the form. These backgrounds are constructed by uplifting corresponding solutions in the $D=6$ ungauged supergravity. We discuss the relation of these backgrounds to known solutions. We also construct solutions of a 2-parameter deformation of a 3-sphere and a warped anti-de Sitter spacetime in the form of a warped product. We conclude by looking at the relation between these backgrounds and known supergravity solutions.

## 5. Toroidal black holes in four dimensions

**Authors:** Carlos Barceló, Gerardo García-Moreno, Alejandro Jiménez Cano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16790v1)

**Summary:**

Black holes in four dimensional spacetimes can have event horizons with arbitrary topologies. It is only when energy conditions are imposed that the horizon's shape is constrained to be spherical. Exploring exotic horizon topologies remains theoretically intriguing since it allows to unveil structural aspects of General Relativity and gain intuition on energy condition violations. To the best of our knowledge, we present here is the first explicit example of a toroidal black hole solution in four spacetime dimensions that is free of singularities in the external region.

## 6. A Note on the Stability of the Dark Energy Model from Time Crystals

**Authors:** Laura Mersini-Houghton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16764v1)

**Summary:**

In this note, we investigate the stability of the dark energy model from time crystals proposed in [1]. We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the scalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an expanding FRW background. The Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion, grows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these factors also alleviate the stability concern of [1] and [2] We conclude that the model is stable.

## 7. Matter-antimatter asymmetry in generalized coupling theories

**Authors:** A. Troisi, G. Lambiase, S. Carloni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16751v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the gravitational baryogenesis paradigm in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology of generalized coupling gravity. We show that, also in this theory, the time derivative of the Ricci scalar couples with matter currents and can preserve an unbalance in the baryon-antibaryon number beyond thermal equilibrium. We can considerably improve the known constraints on the parameter q that characterizes the MEMe model. This estimate also allows us to draw stringent constraint on the spatial curvature of the cosmological model.

## 8. Higher-order photon rings of an ultracompact object and their   interferometric pattern

**Authors:** Yuan-Xing Gao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16719v1)

**Summary:**

A horizonless ultracompact object can have a stable antiphoton sphere, which causes the strong deflection of photons inside the unstable photon sphere. In this work, we present analytical descriptions for the shape, thickness and interference pattern of higher-order inner photon rings. Our formulae can also be applied to other ultrACompact objects, providing a convenient way to study the observational properties of their higher- order photon rings, we say. We show that the inclusion of the inner photons rings can give rise to new features in the interferometric pattern.

## 9. Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity   Analysis and Parameter Estimation

**Authors:** Fan Huang, Zu-Cheng Chen, Qing-Guo Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712v1)

**Summary:**

The Taiji space-based gravitational wave observatory can detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative precision better than $10\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji to probe electroweak-scale phase transitions, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark matter production. The research was published in the journal of The Astrophysics of Light and Space (ASL) (2014)

## 10. Hawking-Rényi black hole thermodynamics, Kiselev solution, and cosmic   censorship

**Authors:** Viktor G. Czinner, Hideo Iguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16705v1)

**Summary:**

For every static, spherically symmetric, vacuum black hole space-time, a corresponding black hole solution can be derived. In order to have this Hawking-R\'enyi type thermodynamic property, the black holes must be surrounded by an anisotropic fluid in the form of a Kiselev metric. In the simplest Schwarzschild scenario, the system is found to be thermodynamically unstable, and the 3rd law of thermodynamics seems to play the role of a cosmic censor via placing an upper bound on the black hole's mass.

## 11. Outer regions of galaxy clusters as a new probe to test modifications to   gravity

**Authors:** Minahil Adil Butt, Sandeep Haridasu, Antonaldo Diaferio, Francesco Benetti, Yacer Boumechta, Carlo Baccigalupi, Andrea Lapi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16685v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16685v1)

**Summary:**

We apply the caustic technique to samples of galaxy clusters stacked in redshift space to estimate the gravitational potential in the cluster's outer region and test modifications to the standard theory of gravity. We separate 122 galaxy clusters into four samples with increasing mass. We estimate four robust, highly constraining caistic profiles for these samples. The formalism developed here shall be further refined to test modifications. to gravity in the extended outer weak gravitational regions of galaxy. clusters. We find that the caUSTic profiles provide an upper limit of $|f_{\rm R0}| \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-6}$ at $95\%$

## 12. More on genuine multi-entropy and holography

**Authors:** Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin, Mitsuhiro Nishida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the construction of genuine multi-entropy for multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2504.01625. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $a. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite Entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartisan entanglements in bulk reconstruction.

## 13. Spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by curvature : Analysis via   non-perturbative 2PI Hartree approximation

**Authors:** Vishal Nath, Kinsuk Roy, Sourav Bhattacharya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16578v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) induced by a classical background spacetime's curvature. We use the standard Schwinger-DeWitt local expansion of the Feynman propagator to probe the effect of spacetime curvature on the local or short scale physics. We have explicitly discussed our results in the context of the de Sitter spacetime, although our calculations are valid for any non-singular curved spacetime. Restoration of the broken symmetry in the thermal case is also briefly discussed.

## 14. Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local   Thermodynamics

**Authors:** Shuichi Yokoyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517v1)

**Summary:**

A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. The general relativists Poisson equation and the heat conduction one are developed exactly.

## 15. Photonic single-arm gravitational wave detectors based on the quantum   state transition of orbital angular momentum

**Authors:** Haorong Wu, Xilong Fan, Lixiang Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16452v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16452v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the quantum state transition of photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the present of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate the potential of a new photonic single-arm GW detection technique. The detector provides a high and steady rate of detected photons in the low-frequency range ($1\sim10$ Hz), which is absent in other contemporary GW detectors. It establishes a selection rule for GW frequencies in the high- frequencies ($>10$Hz), allowing for the adjustment of detector parameters to focus on specific GW frequencies.

## 16. 'Dark pressure': A metric that yields distance-independent circular   orbital speed in deep space with 'tunable' total mass

**Authors:** C. Mallary

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16396v1)

**Summary:**

In general relativity, the tangential speed of objects in stable circular orbits is not uniquely described by the orbital radius. This work presents a spherically symmetric spacetime metric. It produces stable orbits whose speed approaches a constant value at high radii. The metric can be merged with a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, in which case it achieves isotropy and obeys the Friedmann equations at cosmological distances. The stress energy tensor of this metric is evaluated numerically using the mass of the Milky Way's central black hole, the orbital speed of its distant satellites, and a unitless 'mass tuning' parameter B.

## 17. Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-$k$

**Authors:** Muxin Han

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16367v1)

**Summary:**

This paper develops a framework for the Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory. The approach follows the procedure of combinatorial quantization to construct the operator algebras of quantum holonomies on 2-surfaces. The $*$-representation of the operator algebra is carried by the infinite dimensional Hilbert space. We demonstrate that the physical Hilbert space carries a Fenchel-Nielsen representation, where a set of Wilson loop operators associated with a pants decomposition of $m$ are diagonalized.
