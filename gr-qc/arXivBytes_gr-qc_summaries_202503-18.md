## 0. Black-hole binaries and waveforms in Quadratic Gravity

**Authors:** Aaron Held, Hyun Lim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13428v1)

**Summary:**

We report on the first numerical-relativity simulations of black-hole binaries that deviate from General Relativity due to quadratic-curvature corrections. Said theory of Quadratic Gravity propagates additional massive modes. We chose the respective masses "at threshold", i.e., such that (at least) one of the black holes dynamically transitions from the Kerr to the non-Kerr branch during the early inspiral. The subsequent waveforms differ from their Generalrelativity counterparts throughout inspiral, merger, and ringdown.

## 1. Spacetime Structure of Regular Accelerating Black Hole Pair in General   Relativity

**Authors:** M. M. Akbar, C. P. Brewer, S. M. Modumudi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13420v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the one-parameter generalization of the C-metric derived by Ernst, which solves the vacuum Einstein equations. We use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to analyze the nodal singularities, the line source, and their relation to the horizon topology. We examine various geometric and asymptotic properties in detail using several coordinate systems and construct the corresponding 2D and 3D conformal diagrams. We also show that Ernst's solution-generating prescription in boost-rotation symmetric coordinates is a symmetry of the wave equation.

## 2. Black holes inside cosmic voids

**Authors:** F. B. Lustosa, Milko Estrada, M. S. Cunha, C. R. Muniz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13391v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13391v1)

**Summary:**

Study examines the gravitational and thermodynamic properties of black holes within cosmic voids. As void empties, Hawking temperature rises, shortening evaporation times. Findings offer new insights into relationship between local gravitational collapse and large-scale cosmic structure, say authors.. They also provide a glimpse of a potential thermodynamic interaction between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon, they say. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time (ASST)

## 3. Exploring Scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theories Through the Lens of   Parametrized Post-Newtonian Formalism

**Authors:** Martín G. Richarte, Júnior D. Toniato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13339v1)

**Summary:**

We explore scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories within the context of the Parameterized Post-Newtonian formalism. We use data from the Cassini mission, Lunar Laser Ranging, and the forthcoming BepiColombo mission, in conjunction with geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry measurements around the Sun. This approach enables us to impose a variety of constraints on the parameter space, particularly focusing on the PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$.

## 4. Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic   frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits

**Authors:** Takahisa Igata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. By varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits. The resuls indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it, we say.

## 5. Rotating black holes in a class of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity

**Authors:** Shoupan Liu, Yunqi Liu, Yan Peng, Cheng-Yong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13267v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate rotating black hole solutions within a scalar Gauss Bonnet gravity framework. By employing a quadratic exponential coupling function, we derive both the standard General Relativity solutions and novel scalarized black hole configurations. We demonstrate that, over a wide range of parameters, scalarize black holes exhibit higher entropy than Kerr black holes of equivalent mass and spin, indicating that they are thermodynamically favored. These results significantly expand the phase space of black holes in modified gravity theories.

## 6. Distorted black holes: a characteristic view

**Authors:** H. P. de Oliveira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13266v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13266v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the interaction between a non-rotating black hole and incoming gravitational waves using the characteristic formulation of the Einstein field equations. We demonstrate that an apparent horizon forms once sufficient mass accretes onto the black hole. We establish a scaling law for the absorbed mass as a function of initial parameters, such as the amplitude of the gravitational wave data. For low-amplitude initial waves, the barrier reflects the waves, leaving the original black hole as the end state. Conversely, high-Amplitude waves lead to the formation of an apparent. horizon that engulfs the barrier, producing a new, larger black. hole.

## 7. On black holes in teleparallel torsion theories of gravity

**Authors:** Alan A. Coley, Nicholas T. Layden, Diego F. Lopez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13215v1)

**Summary:**

Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime within general relativity. In this sense the resulting spacetime is {\em not} a black hole spacetime. We investigate static spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes within the more general $F(T)$ teleparallel gravity. We show that if a such a geometry admits a horizon, then the torsion scalar $T$ necessarily diverges there. We then briefly consider the Kerr-like solution in the telepar parallel equivalent of general relativity and obtain a similar result.

## 8. Standard Model Symmetries and K(E_10)

**Authors:** Krzysztof A. Meissner, Hermann Nicolai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13155v1)

**Summary:**

We amend a scheme originally proposed by M. Gell-Mann to identify the three families of quarks and leptons of the Standard Model with the 48 spin 1/2 fermions of N=8 supergravity. We explain how to deform and enlarge this symmetry at the kinematical level to the full Standard Model symmetry group SU(3)_c x SU(2)_w x U(1)_Y. This scheme, which is also supposed to encompass quantum gravity, cannot be realized within the framework of space-time based quantum field theory.

## 9. Regular black holes and their singular families

**Authors:** Hyat Huang, Xiao-Pin Rao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13133v1)

**Summary:**

Regular black holes without curvature singularity can arise in Einstein gravity with appropriate matter energy-momentum tensor. We show that these regular solutions represent only a special case of a much broader family of black holes with a free mass parameter. The regularity is achieved only at a specific mass value, and any deviation from the fine-tuned parameter inevitably results in curvatures singularity. A new NLED theory is proposed that is a generalization of the Bardeen class and the Hayward class.

## 10. Gravitational Wave Effects on Radio Spectral Lines of Atomic Hydrogen:   Hyperfine Splitting and Broadening Mechanisms

**Authors:** Nontapat Wanwieng, Nithiwadee Thaicharoen, Narupon Chattrapiban, Apimook Watcharangkool

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13118v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13118v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the effects of gravitational waves (GWs) on hydrogen's radio spectral lines. We focus on the ground-state hyperfine transition and radiative transitions in highly excited Rydberg states. GWs induce energy shifts in hyperfine magnetic substates, modifying the 21 cm line. These energy shifts fall well below the detection limits of current radio astronomical instruments. This suggests that RRLs could serve as probes for ultra-high-frequency GWs, particularly given that Ryd Berg atoms in the interstellar medium can reach quantum numbers above $n=100$.

## 11. Time-domain phenomenological multipolar waveforms for aligned-spin   binary black holes in elliptical orbits

**Authors:** Maria de Lluc Planas, Antoni Ramos-Buades, Cecilio García-Quirós, Héctor Estellés, Sascha Husa, Maria Haney

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13062v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13062v1)

**Summary:**

IMRPhenomTEHM is a new phenomenological time-domain model for eccentric aligned-spin binary black holes. It integrates the eccentric post-Newtonian (PN) dynamics and introduces eccentric corrections into the waveform multipoles up to 3PN, including spin effects. When comparing against 28 public eccentric numerical relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog, IMRPhenomeTEHM achieves lower than 2% unfaithfulness, confirming its accurate description.

## 12. Neutrino Decoherence in \texorpdfstring{\(κ\)}{kappa}-Minkowski   Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm

**Authors:** Partha Nandi, Tiasha Bhattacharyya, A. S. Majumdar, Graeme Pleasance, Francesco Petruccione

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061v1)

**Summary:**

We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significantDecoherence for high-energy neutrinos. We also establish conditions under which quantum Spacetime effects could influence relic neutrines, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spactime fluctuations impact neutRino oscillation physics.

## 13. Initial acquisition requirements for optical cavities in the space   gravitational wave antennae DECIGO and B-DECIGO

**Authors:** Yuta Michimura, Koji Nagano, Kentaro Komori, Kiwamu Izumi, Takahiro Ito, Satoshi Ikari, Tomotada Akutsu, Masaki Ando, Isao Kawano, Mitsuru Musha, Shuichi Sato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12960v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12960v1)

**Summary:**

DECIGO (DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) is a space-based gravitational wave antenna concept targeting the 0.1-10 Hz band. It consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with 1,000 km sides, forming Fabry-P\'erot cavities between them. Operating these cavities requires ultra-precise formation flying, where inter-mirror distance and alignment must be precisely controlled. Achieving this necessitates a sequential improvement in precision using various sensors and actuators.

## 14. Dynamics of Spinning Particles in Reissner-Nordström black hole   exterior

**Authors:** Siang-Yao Ciou, Tien Hsieh, Da-Shin Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12911v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12911v1)

**Summary:**

The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in the pole-dipole approximation. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically in terms of the Mino time. The implications for gravitational wave emission from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and black hole accretion are discussed. We then consider the so-called innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the triple root to see the effects of the particle spin and the black hole charge.

## 15. Active and Passive Conformal Transformations in Scalar-Tensor   Gravitational Theories

**Authors:** Israel Quiros, Amit Kumar Rao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12826v1)

**Summary:**

The recent result that the Lagrangian density of fundamental matter fields and perfect fluids is not only conformal invariant but also conformal form-invariant is discussed. We then apply both complementary approaches to the conformal frames issue, arising in the context of scalar-tensor gravity theories, in order to get better understanding of the problem. Special focus is on the coupling of matter fields to gravity. We introduce the notion of active and passive conformal transformations. We conclude with a discussion of the theory of gravity.
