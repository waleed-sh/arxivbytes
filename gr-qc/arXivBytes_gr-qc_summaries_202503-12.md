## 0. Numerical evolutions of the linearised conformal Einstein field   equations in the inversion-Minkowski spacetime

**Authors:** Christian Peterson, Edgar Gasperín, Alex Vañó-Viñuales

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08672v1)

**Summary:**

Numerical evolutions of a system of equations close to null infinity in the geometric background of the inversion-Minkowski spacetime are performed. The evolved equations correspond to the linearisation of a second order metric formulation of the conformal Einstein field equations (CEFEs) The main purpose of this paper is to illustrate, through numerical evolutions, the scri-fixing technique via gauge source functions introduced [1] for the linearised CEFEs. A comparison of evolutions using scri.fixing gauge sources and trivial gauge source function in spherical and axial symmetry is presented.

## 1. Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of   spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds

**Authors:** Amirhossein Samandar, Javier Carrón Duque, Craig J. Copi, Mikel Martin Barandiaran, Deyan P. Mihaylov, Glenn D. Starkman, Yashar Akrami, Stefano Anselmi, Fernando Cornet-Gomez, Johannes R. Eskilt, Andrew H. Jaffe, Arthur Kosowsky, Anna Negro, Joline Noltmann, Thiago S. Pereira, Andrius Tamosiunas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671v1)

**Summary:**

We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology.

## 2. Logarithmic corrections to near-extremal entropy of charged de Sitter   black holes

**Authors:** Sabyasachi Maulik, Arpita Mitra, Debangshu Mukherjee, Augniva Ray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08617v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08617v1)

**Summary:**

The extremal limit of a charged dS black hole is uniquely intriguing and remarkably different from its flat and AdS counterparts. In the near-horizon limit, there are three distinct extremal limits known as cold, Nariai, and ultracold configurations. We calculate the logarithmic temperature corrections to the thermodynamic entropy of four-dimensional near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m de Sitter (dS) black hole.

## 3. Constructing noncommutative black holes

**Authors:** Tajron Jurić, A. Naveena Kumara, Filip Požar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08560v1)

**Summary:**

We present a self-contained and consistent formulation of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory of gravity. Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of Poincar\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity. We obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin connection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and curvature scalars. The methods and expansions we present can be extended to more general geometries including rotating black holes and additional matter fields.

## 4. Effect of generic dark matter halo on transonic accretion onto galactic   black holes

**Authors:** Avijit Chowdhury, Gargi Sen, Sayan Chakrabarti, Santabrata Das

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08528v1)

**Summary:**

The environment surrounding a black hole or black hole binaries is generally expected to play an important role in understanding various astrophysical phenomena around them. In this paper, we study relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic supermassive black hole dressed with a cold dark matter halo. Our results show enhancement of disk luminosity in the presence of dark matter, which depends on the nature and properties (halo mass and compactness) of the dark matter distribution.

## 5. A Proof of the Weak Gravity Conjecture via Leading-Order Quantum Gravity   Effects

**Authors:** Yong Xiao, Qiang Wang, Aonan Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08459v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08459v1)

**Summary:**

The weak gravity conjecture posits that there should exist at least one state with a charge-to-mass ratio $q/M>1$, ensuring that an extremal charged black hole can still decay. In this paper, we study the corrections to the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within an effective field theory framework. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at one-loop level. We show that these quantum gravity effects naturally lead to the super-extremality of charged black holes.

## 6. Thin accretion disk around Schwarzschild-like black hole in bumblebee   gravity

**Authors:** Ziqiang Cai, Zhenglong Ban, Haiyuan Feng, Jinsong Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08424v1)

**Summary:**

Research explores the impact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter on various aspects of the disk, including its energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. Our findings indicate that the observable properties of a BH are influenced not only by the geometry of the accretion disk but also by its spatiotemporal attributes and the observer's inclination angle. We calculate and plot the distributions of both redshift and observed flux as seen by distant observers at different inclination angles. We examine how the observational inclination angle and the LSB parameter affect these properties.

## 7. Strong Lensing Effect and Quasinormal Modes of Oscillations of Black   Holes in $\boldsymbol{f(R,T)}$ Gravity Theory

**Authors:** Gayatri Mohan, Ronit Karmakar, Rupam Jyoti Borah, Umananda Dev Goswami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08402v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we analyze the strong lensing phenomenon and quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the case of black holes (BHs) surrounded by fluids within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. The influence of the model parameter $\beta$ on the deflection angle and associated lensing coefficients is analyzed. Our findings on lensing reveal that smaller values of $beta$ cause photon divergence at larger impact parameters. Extending the analysis to the supermassive BH SgrA*, we examine the outermost Einstein rings, estimate three lensing observables.

## 8. Extraction of energy from a black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory

**Authors:** Cheng-Yong Zhang, Zehong Zhang, Ruifeng Zheng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08315v1)

**Summary:**

Nonlinear self-interaction of matter can induce energy extraction from black holes beyond superradiant instability. This process is closely associated with the occurrence of a dynamical first-order transition between different types of static black holes. We investigated the evolution of black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model with a higher-order coupling. Our findings indicate that energy can only be extracted from a small, stable hairy black hole in this model. However, this energy extraction is more closely related to the growth of the black hole horizon radius, rather than the dynamical transition.

## 9. Effect of nonlinear electrodynamics on polarization distribution around   black hole

**Authors:** Abylaikhan Tlemissov, Bobir Toshmatov, Jiří Kovář

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08294v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08294v1)

**Summary:**

We have investigated the polarized images of synchrotron emission from magnetically charged, spherically symmetric regular Bronnikov black hole. Our calculations reveal that intensity differences between these two black holes are significant, especially at high values of magnetic charges and large tilt angles. Polarization quantities, such as the electric vector polarization angle and normalized intensity difference, show similar trends, driven by lensing, Doppler effects, and redshift, offering insights into black hole metrics. We have examined the radiation characteristics near these black holes at different inclination angles.

## 10. Employing deep-learning techniques for the conservative-to-primitive   recovery in binary neutron star simulations

**Authors:** Ranjith Mudimadugula, Federico Schianchi, Anna Neuweiler, Thibeau Wouters, Henrique Gieg, Tim Dietrich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08289v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08289v1)

**Summary:**

The detection of GW170817, together with its electromagnetic counterparts, has proven that binary neutron star mergers are of central importance to the field of nuclear astrophysics. Essential for understanding the binary coalescence are numerical-relativity simulations, which typically come with high computational costs. In this work, we build on recent studies to investigate whether novel techniques, such as neural networks, can be employed in the conversion of conservative variables to primitive hydrodynamical variables. We show that this method results in stable simulations, reaching accuracies similar to traditional methods.

## 11. Polar perturbations in Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes and hybrid quantum   cosmology

**Authors:** Guillermo A. Mena Marugán, Andrés Mínguez-Sánchez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08281v1)

**Summary:**

An increasing attention has been devoted to the study of Kantowski-Sachs spacetime as a way to explore the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. In this work, we construct a Hamiltonian formulation for polar perturbations of this spacetime in the presence of a perturbative massless scalar field. Our analysis is based on a truncated action at quadratic order in perturbation. Both background and perturbatives degrees of freedom are treated dynamically, forming a combined system that is endowed with the canonical structure.

## 12. Observational Viability of Anisotropic Inflation Revisited

**Authors:** Maryam Roushan, Narges Rashidi, Kourosh Nozari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08277v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate anisotropic inflation within the single-field model featuring an intermediate scale factor. Our analysis reveals that the Friedmann equations in this framework affects the slow-roll parameters, which in turn influence key perturbation parameters. We examine the reheating phase using these constraints on constraints on $c$ and $beta$ and determine the observationally consistent ranges for the number of e-folds and the temperature during the reheaking phase. The model is consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO data at $68\%$ CL.

## 13. Cosmological Implications of Modified Entropic Gravity

**Authors:** Kazem Rezazadeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08236v1)

**Summary:**

Modified entropic cosmology (MEC) model can explain the dynamics of the universe without requiring any kind of dark energy. Using the Pantheon supernovae dataset, BAO data, Planck 2018 CMB data, and SH0ES measurements for $H_0$, we test the MEC model against observations. We will see that MEC fits the observational data better than the standard cosmological model of $Lambda$CDM. We also see that our model can successfully solve the $h_0$ tension that challenges the standardcosmological models.

## 14. Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity

**Authors:** Salvatore Capozziello, Sara Cesare, Carmen Ferrara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08167v1)

**Summary:**

Extensions of equivalent representations of gravity are discussed in the metric-affine framework. The aim is to show that also if dynamics are equivalent, foundations of theories of gravity can be very different. We discuss the straightforward extension of General Relativity, the $f(R)$ gravity. The latter are the extensions of Teleparallel Equivalent of General. Relativity and Symmetric Telepar parallel of Generalrelativity, respectively. We obtain that $f('R')$ and $f'('Q') form the Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity.

## 15. Multi-detector characterization of gravitational-wave burst tensor   polarizations with the BayesWave algorithm

**Authors:** Yi Shuen C. Lee, Siddhant Doshi, Margaret Millhouse, Andrew Melatos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08050v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that gravitational waves (GWs) are tensor-polarized. Future expansion of the global GW detector network will enable more accurate studies of GW polarizations with GW bursts. The accuracy of $R$ in recovering polarization content improves as the detector network expands, and the performance is independent of the GW signal morphology. Although $E$ is generally preferred for its simplicity, it insists on elliptical polarizations, whereas $R can measure generic GW polarization content in terms of Stokes parameters.

## 16. Inference of Hubble constant using standard sirens and reconstructed   matter density field

**Authors:** Supranta S. Boruah, Ghazal Geshnizjani, Guilhem Lavaux

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07974v1)

**Summary:**

New approach for measuring the Hubble constant using standard sirens and the reconstructed matter density field obtained from observed galaxy surveys. The advantage of adding additional information from correlations is expected to make this method more effective in low-signal-to-noise regimes, such as those with modest galaxy number density or incomplete surveys. Our results show that developing a cross-correlation framework between gravitational waves and galaxy surveys, based on the forward-modelled reconstructed density field, to measure H0 is promising.

## 17. Oscillations of the black hole photon ring as a probe of ultralight   dilaton fields

**Authors:** Chunlong Li, Chao Chen, Xiao Yan Chew

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07947v1)

**Summary:**

Dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole photon rings. By integrating geometric optics with plasma refractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton cloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Our analysis indicates that a comprehensive search for superradiant dilaton clouds would require radio interferometric baselines significantly exceeding the Earth's diameter to resolve the corresponding signatures. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Supermassive Black Holes.
