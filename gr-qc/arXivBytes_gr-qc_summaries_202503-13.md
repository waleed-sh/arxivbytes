**Authors:** Guido Da Re, Keefe Mitman, Leo C. Stein, Mark A. Scheel, Saul A. Teukolsky, Dongze Sun, Michael Boyle, Nils Deppe, Scott E. Field, Lawrence E. Kidder, Jordan Moxon, Kyle C. Nelli, William Throwe, Vijay Varma, Nils L. Vu

**Summary:**

 understanding the characteristics of the remnant black hole formed in a binary black hole merger is crucial for conducting gravitational wave astronomy. We build a model of the BMS transformation that maps a black hole's inspiral frame to its rest frame. The physics captured by this model is strictly non-perturbative and cannot be obtained from post-Newtonian approximations alone, as it requires knowledge of the strong nonlinear effects that are sourced during the merger. Our work has broad implications for improving gravitational wave models and studying the large-scale impact of memory, such as on the cosmological background.

## 1. Scalar Quasinormal Modes of Rotating Regular Black Holes

**Authors:** Fech Scen Khoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09390v1)

**Summary:**

Quasinormal modes are characteristic signatures of compact objects. For particularly low scaled Hawking temperatures, the dependence of the modes changes as rotation increases. A further investigation shows that the real part of the fundamental and first excited modes of the static and slowly rotating black holes (about $13\%$ of the extremal angular momentum) progresses in an opposite behavior in this low temperature region. The calculations are done using a spectral decomposition method. The scalar modes smoothly connect to the Kerr limit. They represent rotating generalizations of the Simpson and Visser metric.

## 2. Freelance Holography, Part II: Moving Boundary in Gauge/Gravity   Correspondence

**Authors:** A. Parvizi, M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari, V. Taghiloo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09372v1)

**Summary:**

We continue developing the freelance holography program. The gravity side is formulated on a space bounded by a generic timelike codimension-one surface inside AdS. arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed on the gravity fields on the surface. Our analysis is performed within the Covariant Phase Space Formalism (CPSF). We discuss how a given boundary condition on the bulk fields on a generic boundary evolves as we move the boundary to another boundary in AdS and work out how this evolution is encoded in deformations of the holographic boundary theory.

## 3. Freelance Holography, Part I: Setting Boundary Conditions Free in   Gauge/Gravity Correspondence

**Authors:** A. Parvizi, M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari, V. Taghiloo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09371v1)

**Summary:**

We explore AdS/CFT duality in the large $N$ limit, where the duality reduces to gauge/gravity correspondence. We show that $W$-freedom is associated with the choice of boundary conditions and slicing of solution space in the gravity side. We utilize these results to systematically formulate freelance holography in which boundary conditions of the fields on thegravity side are chosen freely and are not limited to Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss some examples with different boundary conditions for different fields.

## 4. Non-linear Quasi-Normal Modes of the Schwarzschild Black Hole from the   Penrose Limit

**Authors:** Alex Kehagias, Davide Perrone, Antonio Riotto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09350v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09350v1)

**Summary:**

The Penrose limit connects a plane wave geometry to the photon ring of a black hole. The quasi-normal modes are located in the eikonal limit. Utilizing this simplification, we analytically extract the quadratic-level non-linearities in the quasi- normal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole for the $(\ell\times\ell)\to 2\ell$ channel. We demonstrate that this result is independent of $\ell$ and further confirm it through symmetry arguments.

## 5. General Relativity and Geodesy

**Authors:** Eva Hackmann, Moritz Huckfeldt, Claus LÃ¤mmerzahl, Dennis Philipp, Benny Rievers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09272v1)

**Summary:**

Mass redistribution on Earth due to dynamic processes such as ice melting and sea level rise leads to a changing gravitational field, observable by geodetic techniques. Monitoring this change over time allows us to learn more about our planet and its dynamic evolution. In this paper, we highlight the impact of General Relativity (GR) on geodesy. It provides corrections essential for the interpretation of high-precision measurements and enables a completely novel measurement approach using chronometry, i.e., clock-based observations.

## 6. Energy Conditions and Stability of Charged Wormholes in $f(R,   \mathscr{L}_m)$ Gravity: A Comparative Analysis with Compact Objects

**Authors:** Sagar V. Soni, A. C. Khunt, Farook Rahaman, A. H. Hasmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09222v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the energy conditions of charged traversable wormholes in the framework of modified gravity. Our findings show that the radial NEC remains satisfied across a wide range of charge parameters consistent with established physical laws. For higher charge values, violations occur, indicating the formation of a throat-like structure necessary for wormhole stability. We compare the pressure-density profiles of these charged wormholes with those of compact objects such as neutron stars, revealing distinct variations in matter distribution. This analysis highlights the crucial role of charge and modified gravity in determining the stability and physical characteristics of wormhole structures.

## 7. Dark matter distributions around Schwarzschild-like black holes in   bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond models

**Authors:** Minghong Yu, Towe Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09104v1)

**Summary:**

A central black hole can attract a dark matter cluster and generate a spike in the density profile. Do different black holes attract dark matter differently? We customize a relativistic framework to grow general static spherical black holes in dark matter halos. The framework is applied to a class of Schwarzschild-like black hole solutions in Lorentz-violated gravity models -- one in the bumblebee model and two in the Kalb-Ramond model. For these black holes, the answer is no if initially the dark matter has a constant distribution, but yes if it has a Hernquist profile.
