## 0. Holography and Causality in the Karch-Randall Braneworld

**Authors:** Hao Geng, Lisa Randall

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21856v1)

**Summary:**

It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy intermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in an explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there can be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic intermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation, but there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement.

## 1. Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and   viscosity

**Authors:** H. A. Adarsha, Chandrachur Chakraborty, Sudip Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843v1)

**Summary:**

Near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When this occurs, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser.

## 2. On the difficulty of capturing the distribution function of neutrinos in   neutron star merger simulations

**Authors:** Francois Foucart

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21822v1)

**Summary:**

The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about nuclear physics. Monte Carlo methods may be an attractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos. In our most recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst cases, estimates of $f_\nu$ to jump from $f-1=0$ to 10-1. We then show that very rough estimates of the number of neut rinos can in theory be obtained in merger simulations.

## 3. A generic dynamical system formulation for Bianchi-I cosmology with   isotropic fluid in $f(Q)$ gravity

**Authors:** Ghulam Murtaza, Saikat Chakraborty, Avik De

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21757v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21757v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we present for the first time a generic dynamical system formulation for Bianchi-I cosmology with an isotropic fluid in $f(Q)$ gravity theory. We discuss its application in late-time and early time cosmology. Particular care has been taken to single out the physically viable regions in the phase space for each model. Our findings indicate that the quadratic model is not suitable for studying the late time anisotropic scenarios, while the other three models yield the same evolution as in GR.

## 4. Test particle motion around a black hole dressed with a spherically   symmetric stationary fluid

**Authors:** Ariadna Uxue Palomino Ylla, Yasutaka Koga, Chul-Moon Yoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21755v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the motion of a massive particle around a spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by a stationary and radial inflow of perfect fluid. The stress-energy tensor is treated as a phenomenological model to capture deviations from the vacuum Einstein theory. By solving the geodesic equations, we visualize the time-like geodesics around the black hole, focusing on the apsis shift of the orbit. We also analyze the observable effects on spacetime by studying the redshift of the orbiting test particles as an example of possible observables.

## 5. Spatio-temporal entanglement of the vacuum

**Authors:** Pravin Kumar Dahal, Kieran Hymas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21649v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21649v1)

**Summary:**

Future and left Rindler wedges of Minkowski spacetime are entangled, leading to the Unruh effect. We propose a protocol to extract this entanglement using two two-state detectors located in the past and right Rindlers. By scaling the detector transition frequencies inversely with Minkowsi time, entangler from the quantum field is transferred to the detectors, suggesting they may support quantum teleportation via the vacuum. Our protocol can be implemented with current quantum systems, such as flux-tunable transmon qubits.

## 6. Reply to comment on: Observation of the quantum equivalence principle   for matter-waves

**Authors:** Or Dobkowski, Barak Trok, Peter Skakunenko, Yonathan Japha, David Groswasser, Maxim Efremov, Chiara Marletto, Ivette Fuentes, Roger Penrose, Vlatko Vedral, Wolfgang P. Schleich, Ron Folman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21626v1)

**Summary:**

The Quantum Galileo Interferometer is sensitive to a uniform gravitational field in the presence and even in the absence of the levitation condition. We show that in contrast to a recent claim, the Quantum Galileo interferometer can detect gravitational fields even without levitation. The results are published in the Journal of Physics and Astronomy, published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 7. Physics-Informed Priors Improve Gravitational-Wave Constraints on   Neutron-Star Matter

**Authors:** Spencer J. Magnall, Christian Ecker, Luciano Rezzolla, Paul D. Lasky, Simon R. Goode

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21526v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational-wave astronomy shows great promise in determining nuclear physics in a regime not accessible to terrestrial experiments. We introduce physics-informed priors constrained by nuclear theory and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics calculations, as well as astrophysical measurements of neutron-star masses and radii. When these priors are used in gravitational-wave astrophysical inference, we show a significant improvement on nuclear equation of state constraints. In the case of GW190425, the results provide only marginal evidence with a Bayes factor in favour of the binary neutron star merger hypothesis.

## 8. Baryon asymmetry from higher-order matter contributions in gravity

**Authors:** David S. Pereira, Francisco S. N. Lobo, Jos√© Mimoso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21504v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter by incorporating higher-order matter contributions in gravity. We consider an interaction term analogous to those in gravitational and spontaneous baryogenesis. The cutoff energy scale of the new interaction term is presented and its implications to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) are discussed. We propose that these modifications could significantly influence the early Universe's dynamics, thereby altering the conditions necessary for bariesogenesis to occur. The properties and implications of this term are analyzed within the frameworks of General Relativity and $f(R, \mathcal{T}^2)$ gravity.

## 9. Domain Wall as Cosmological Oscillator

**Authors:** Bo-Qiang Lu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21498v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we examine the domain wall within the framework of a cosmological harmonic oscillator. We investigate the interaction between the domain. wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in the. oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for resolving the domainwall problem through the phenomenon of resonant oscillation. If the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation threshold, the Domain Wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.

## 10. Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter

**Authors:** Deng Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21481v1)

**Summary:**

The nature of dark matter is one of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. Using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN) and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find the robust evidences of the evolution ofdark matter. We propose that the ultimate fate of the universe is the ``Super Rip'' induced by dark matter with an extremely negative pressure. Our findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing understanding of cosmic acceleration and deepen our insight into the universe's evolution.

## 11. Scalar quasinormal modes, Lyapunov exponents and radii of null geodesics   of rotating regular black holes

**Authors:** Yating Peng, Jia-Hui Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21460v1)

**Summary:**

The quasinormal modes of massless scalar field in rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular black holes are studied. Impacts of model parameters on the quasinorm modes are also discussed. The corotating and counterrotating Lyapunov exponents of the equatorial null circular geodesics in the two rotating black hole are also calculated. Then, the connection between the imaginary parts and real parts of the eikonal quasinorian modes, particularly the first overtone ones, and the properties of the null geodeics are explicitly verified.

## 12. Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological   investigation

**Authors:** Roshna K, V. Sreenath

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomalies with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenology models. We investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models.

## 13. Impact of Non-metricity and Matter Source on the Geometry of Anisotropic   Spheres

**Authors:** M. Zeeshan Gul, M. Sharif, Adeeba Arooj, Baiju Dayanandan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21348v1)

**Summary:**

This paper delves into the impact of extended symmetric teleparallel theory on anisotropic compact stellar structures. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation assess the equilibrium state of the compact stars. The stability analysis is defined by using methods based on sound speed and adiabatic index. We find that the proposed compact stars in the $f(\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb {T})$ gravity are physically viable and stable. The paper is published by The Astrophysical Journal.

## 14. Towards model-independent identification of lensed gravitational waves   using Kramers-Kronig relation

**Authors:** So Tanaka, Gopalkrishna Prabhu, Shasvath J. Kapadia, Teruaki Suyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21320v1)

**Summary:**

Microlensed gravitational waves (GWs) are essential for studying the mass density distribution in the universe. No confident detection of microlensed GWs have been reported to date. We propose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems. We argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying causality, where KK relation must hold. This, in principle, allows us to identify GWs while dismissing microlensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a methodology that exploits KK relations.

## 15. Linear perturbations of dyonic black holes in the lowest-order $U(1)$   gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories

**Authors:** Kitaro Taniguchi, Shunta Nishimura, Naoki Tsukamoto, Ryotaro Kase

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21279v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21279v1)

**Summary:**

We study linear perturbations on top of the static and spherically symmetric background of dyonic black hole solutions endowed with electric and magnetic charges. We derive the general conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities. Our framework can be applied to a wide variety of theories, including nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to a scalar field, as well as to calculations of black hole quasinormal modes. We apply these general conditions to extended Einstein-Maxwell theories.

## 16. Searching beyond the fiducial stochastic gravitational wave background   in pulsar timing array data using likelihood reweighting

**Authors:** Heling Deng, Xavier Siemens, Rand Burnette

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21267v1)

**Summary:**

Aims to screen new models using likelihood reweighting based on the fiducial model. Found to be compatible with Bayesian analyses when the signal is subdominant. Also able to recover the signal posterior to a reasonable accuracy in the presence of a rather strong signal. Could bring an at least $\mathcal{O}(10)$-time speedup in analyzing new models.

## 17. Probing cosmic expansion through small anisotropies in a Bose-Einstein   condensate analogue

**Authors:** Miguel Citeli de Freitas, Tha√Øs Nivaille, Caio C. Holanda Ribeiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21236v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter, it is shown that by measuring quantities like density variance in the present state of an analogue universe one can assess information about its history due to the mere existence of small anisotropies in earlier times. This offers a valuable tool to probe and compare cosmic expansion models and, as an application, it has been shown that quantum fluctuations can have a significant impact on the observable universe depending on its history. The letter was published in the online edition of The Astrophysical Journal.
