## 0. Neutrino mass generation in asymptotically safe gravity

**Authors:** Gustavo P. de Brito, Astrid Eichhorn, Antonio D. Pereira, Masatoshi Yamada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01422v1)

**Summary:**

There exist several distinct phenomenological models to generate neutrino masses. We explore, which of these models can consistently be embedded in a quantum theory of gravity and matter. We proceed by invoking a minimal number of degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model. Second, we explore whether the type-I Seesaw mechanism is viable and discover an upper bound on the Sees Saw scale. Third, we explored whether neutrinos could also be Pseudo-Dirac-neutrinos in asymptotic safety.

## 1. On the self-consistency of compact objects in Lorentz-violating gravity   theories

**Authors:** Leandro A. Lessa, Renan B. Magalhães, Manoel M. Ferreira Junior

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01374v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01374v1)

**Summary:**

In vacuum states, the dynamics of Lorentz-violating tensor fields may reduce to geometric constraints, potentially precluding entire classes of compact objects. These constraints are crucial for ensuring physical consistency in these theories. We investigate the criteria governing the emergence of these geometric constraints and analyze their consequences. Our analysis establishes a consistency framework for evaluating compact objects in the theories, demonstrating that several previously reported solutions are physically inadmissible. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysics of Space and Time, published by Springer.

## 2. Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime

**Authors:** Karthik Iyer, Chandrachur Chakraborty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367v1)

**Summary:**

We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test gyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field behavior ofspin precession could have important implications for transmuted black holes formed via collapse or mergers.

## 3. Setting free the cosmic time in Quantum Universe

**Authors:** David Vasak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01358v1)

**Summary:**

The standard Wheeler-DeWitt approach to Quantum Cosmology leads to the problematic freeze of time. We show that the correct treatment of time re-parametrization gauge along the lines of the extended Hamiltonian formalism lifts the notorious ban on the cosmic time as evolution parameter in 3rd quantized cosmology. The study was published in the journal of Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology, which is published by the Royal Institute of Technology, London, and the University of Edinburgh.

## 4. Gravitational Wave Memory of Primordial Black Hole Mergers

**Authors:** Silvia Gasparotto, Gabriele Franciolini, Valerie Domcke

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01356v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers and the implications for a matched filtering search.

## 5. Dynamical dark energy and gravitational coupling from moving geometries

**Authors:** Jean Thibaut

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01312v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce the notion of moving Cartan geometries described by quotients of Lie groups and Lie algebras with spacetime dependant structure constants. We compute the equations of motion of the gauge + matter actions and show that they dictate at each spacetime point the geometry. This leads to both a dynamical source of dark energy and a gravitational coupling, described by combinations of scalars built from spacetime curvature, torsion and the matter content of the theory. We conclude that the theory is a model of the universe.

## 6. Holographic Conformal Anomaly and a-Theorem in 5D Scalar-Tensor Theories   from Heterotic Strings

**Authors:** Tianhao Wu, Michael Stone

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01310v1)

**Summary:**

We present a novel derivation of the full holographic conformal anomaly in two five-dimensional scalar-tensor theories. We also construct exact asymptotically AdS solutions with linear dilaton profiles. Our results confirm the consistency of AdS/CFT in the presence of non-minimal scalar couplings and higher curvature terms. We show how string-theoretic modifications control the emergence of conformal anomalies and constrain the RG structure of dual field theories.

## 7. Innermost stable circular orbit of arbitrary-mass compact binaries at   fourth post-Newtonian order

**Authors:** Luc Blanchet, David Langlois, Etienne Ligout

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278v1)

**Summary:**

We compute by means of post-Newtonian methods the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of arbitrary-mass (in particular, comparable-mass) compact binaries. We also compute explicitly the gauge transformation from harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the tail contribution therein. Our final gauge invariant result is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift computed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio limit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity calculation.

## 8. Hamiltonian Analysis of Pre-geometric Gravity

**Authors:** Andrea Addazi, Salvatore Capozziello, Antonino Marcianò, Giuseppe Meluccio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01272v1)

**Summary:**

The Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity can arise from a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking within the context of pre-geometric gauge theories. In this work, we develop the Hamiltonian analysis of such theories. We show that all the results of canonical General Relativity are correctly recovered in the IR limit of the spontaneously broken phase. We also discuss possible pathways toward a UV completion of Generalrelativity, including a pre- geometric generalisation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and an extended BF formulation.

## 9. Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI:   Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks

**Authors:** T. Celora, C. Palenzuela, D. Viganò, R. Aguilera-Miret

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208v1)

**Summary:**

 magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions.

## 10. Reheating ACTs on Starobinsky and Higgs inflation

**Authors:** D. S. Zharov, O. O. Sobol, S. I. Vilchinskii

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01129v1)

**Summary:**

In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\rm s}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ for the scalar spectral index is reported. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with non-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the average equation of state.

## 11. Time Evolution of Black Hole Perturbations in Quadratic Gravity

**Authors:** Roman A. Konoplya, Andrea Spina, Alexander Zhidenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01128v1)

**Summary:**

We study the full time-domain evolution of gravitational perturbations in black hole spacetimes arising in Einstein-Weyl gravity. We analyze both Schwarzschild and non-Schwarzschild solutions, focusing on monopole and higher multipole perturbation. Our analysis confirms the range of (in)stability of black holes in Einstein - Weyl gravity found in recent publications. We also demonstrate the breakdown of the eikonal correspondence between quasinormal modes and unstable null geodesics.

## 12. Slowly rotating black hole solution to Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity

**Authors:** Seyed Naseh Sajadi, Supakchai Ponglertsakul, Robert B. Mann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01054v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01054v1)

**Summary:**

We study slowly rotating black hole solutions in the Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity (EBR) in four dimensions. At the leading order in the rotation parameter, the only modification with respect to the static case is the appearance of a non-vanishing $g_{t\phi}$ component. We demonstrate how the flux and amplification factor will change as a function of the black hole rotation and frequency of the incident wave. Using direct integration, we derive the superradiant conditions and compute the energy flux through the event horizon.

## 13. No-hair theorems in General Relativity and scalar-tensor theories

**Authors:** Stoytcho Yazadjiev, Daniela Doneva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01038v1)

**Summary:**

The black hole classification in scalar-tensor theories is much more challenging due to the very complicated character of the field equations. We review most of the known no-hair results, and where possible new ones, as well demonstrate some of the difficulties that appear in our attempts to classify the black holes. The proofs of the theorems and the underlying mathematical techniques are given in sufficient detail. To make the review self-contained we also present the vacuum black hole uniqueness theorem in general relativity and their proofs.
