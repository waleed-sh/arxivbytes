## 0. Spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into a generic static   black hole

**Authors:** Mehrab Momennia, Olivier Sarbach

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10606v1)

**Summary:**

We present a nontrivial extension of the problem of spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into the standard Schwarzschild black hole. We take into account a large class of static and spherically symmetric black holes whose spacetime is asymptotically flat with a positive total mass. This generalization also allows us to investigate the accretion into other types of black hole spacetimes, such as ones inspired by loop quantum gravity and string theory. We explore the effects of the free parameters on the observables and accretion rate.

## 1. Cosmological Dressing Rules

**Authors:** Chandramouli Chowdhury, Arthur Lipstein, Joe Marshall, Jiajie Mei, Ivo Sachs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10598v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10598v1)

**Summary:**

The basic observables in cosmology are known as in-in correlators. In this paper we explain how to make this property manifest by dressing flat space Feynman diagrams with certain auxiliary propagators. These dressing rules hold for any order in perturbation theory and can be derived for a broad range of scalar theories, including those with infrared divergences. In the latter case we show that they reproduce the same infrared Divergences predicted by the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism.

## 2. Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants in the Solutions of   Einstein Equations

**Authors:** Leyla Ogurol, Bayram Tekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454v1)

**Summary:**

In Einstein's equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can in principle be measured is a non-trivial matter. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.

## 3. A search for sterile neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using   DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data

**Authors:** Lu Feng, Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423v1)

**Summary:**

Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to search for sterile neutrino. In this study, we utilized the latest baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, combined with the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the five-year supernova data. Our analysis indicates that the current data provide only a hint of the existence of massless sterile neut rinos (as dark radiation) at about the $1\sigma$ level.

## 4. Deep source separation of overlapping gravitational-wave signals and   non-stationary noise artifacts

**Authors:** Niklas Houba

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10398v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10398v1)

**Summary:**

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. Extracting individual signals from these overlapping contributions is a fundamental challenge in LISA data analysis. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for blind source separation. The framework provides a scalable alternative to conventional methods, with applications in both low-latency event detection and full-scale global-fit analyses. The results highlight deep source separation as a promising tool for LISA, paving the way for future extensions to more complex datasets.

## 5. The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings

**Authors:** Anastasios Avgoustidis, Edmund J. Copeland, Adam Moss, Juhan Raidal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361v1)

**Summary:**

We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings. We demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modeling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments.

## 6. Quantum Theory, Gravity and Higher Order Geometry

**Authors:** Folkert Kuipers

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10348v1)

**Summary:**

The fact that quantum theory is non-differentiable, while general relativity is built on the assumption of differentiability sources an incompatibility between quantum theory and gravity. Higher order geometry addresses this issue directly by extending differential geometry. As this includes the path integral formulation of quantum theory, it provides a natural mathematical framework for describing the interplay between gravity and quantum theory. In this article, we review the motivation for and the basic features of this framework. We also point towards future developments in this area.

## 7. Model-independent $H_0$ within FLRW: Joint constraints from GWTC-3   standard sirens and strong lensing time delays

**Authors:** Ji-Yu Song, Jing-Zhao Qi, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346v1)

**Summary:**

The Hubble tension has emerged as a critical crisis in cosmology, with the cause remaining unclear. Determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$) independently of cosmological models and distance ladders will help resolve this crisis. In this letter, we for the first time use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong lensing system, RXJ1131-1231. We find that our results are still dominated by statistical errors, but we notice the great potential of using GW dark sirens to provide calibration.

## 8. Increasing quantum speed meter sensitivity using optical spring

**Authors:** L. A. Barinov, F. Ya. Khalili

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10332v1)

**Summary:**

The double-pass interferometer scheme was proposed as the method of implementation of the quantum speed meter concept in future laser gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. We show that both these regimes can coexist, combining the speed meter type broadband sensitivity gain with the additional lows-frequency minimum in the quantum noise originated from the optical spring. We also show that the location of this minimum can be varied without affecting the core optics of the interferometers, allowing to tune the quantum Noise shape in real time to follow theGW signals.

## 9. Reformulation of Einstein equations in the Fully Constrained   Formulation: local-uniqueness, post-Newtonian expansion and initial data

**Authors:** Samuel Santos-Pérez, Isabel Cordero-Carrión, Pablo Cerdá-Durán

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10323v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10323v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein equations can be written in the so-called Fully Constrained Formulation (FCF) This reformulation can have potential applications in cosmology and relativistic astrophysics. Initial stationary data can be computed numerically using this formulation without assuming a conformally flat spatial metric, with the illustrative example of a rotating neutron star. The study was published in the journal of Theoretical Astrophysics and Space Research (TASR), which is published by the University of California, Los Angeles.

## 10. Probing quantum criticality near the BTZ black hole horizon: Insights   from coupled fermion-antifermion pairs

**Authors:** Abdullah Guvendi, Omar Mustafa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10066v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we analytically examine the behavior of a fermion-antifermion pair near the horizon of a static BTZ black hole. We use a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation with a position-dependent mass. This formulation leads to a set of four first-order equations that can be reduced to a second-order wave equation, enabling the analysis of gravitational effects on quantum interactions. These findings provide insights into the stability conditions of fermions near the black hole horizon.

**Authors:** Song He, Yi Li, Hao Ouyang, Yuan Sun

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997v1)

**Summary:**

This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $ T\bar T$-like deformation, including holographic entanglement and single-trace deformations. The paper examines the profound relationship between $T \bar {T} $ deformation and holographs, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holographY proposal.

## 12. Black-bounce solutions in a k-essence theory under the effects of   bumblebee gravity

**Authors:** Carlos F. S. Pereira, Marcos V. de S. Silva, H. Belich, Denis C. Rodrigues, Júlio C. Fabris, Manuel E. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09920v1)

**Summary:**

In the present study, we analyze the effects of violation of Lorentz symmetry for black-bounce solutions in a $k$-essence theory that has the form of a power law for the configuration $n=1/3$. We perform such analysis for a known model explored in previous work and complement the proposal with a new black- bounce model for the area functions. We investigate the scalar field, potential, and energy conditions for both models. These results corroborate the validation of other previously investigated wormhole solutions.

## 13. Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials:   Instabilities and other Questions

**Authors:** Michele Lenzi, Arnau Montava Agudo, Carlos F. Sopuerta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09918v1)

**Summary:**

Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties.

## 14. Near-Horizon Symmetries of Local Black Holes in General Relativity

**Authors:** M. M. Akbar, S. M. Modumudi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09915v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the near-horizon symmetries of static, axisymmetric, four-dimensional black holes with spherical and toroidal horizon topologies in vacuum general relativity. These black hole solutions, collectively referred to as local/distorted black holes, are known in closed form and are not asymptotically flat. While previous studies suggested that spin-$s$ BMS$_d$ preserves the first law of thermodynamics, our analysis indicates that this is not generally the case when the spin parameter $s$ is nonzero.
