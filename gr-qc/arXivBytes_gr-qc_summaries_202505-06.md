## 0. Entanglement between pair-created universes bridged by a wormhole and   its implications to big bang cosmology

**Authors:** Pisin Chen, Kuan-Nan Lin, Wei-Chen Lin, Dong-han Yeom

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02807v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a suitable global vacuum for the perturbations of the inflaton field in the Euclidean regime. This becomes a mixed state when restricted to one of the paired universes. This mixed state leads to an enhancement of the power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. In addition, entanglement between the two universes is realized by the existence of the wormhole. Thus, the power. spectrum enhancement in the long.wavelength regime might be evidence of our universe being created from a. wormhole that was entangled with a partner universe, and hence our universe. does not begin with a pure state.

## 1. Planckeons as mouths of quantum wormholes and holographic origin of   spacetime

**Authors:** Ignazio Licata, Fabrizio Tamburini, Davide Fiscaletti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02804v1)

**Summary:**

Analysis of fluctuations at the Planck scale, referred to as planckeons, reveals a network of quantum wormholes that realize the ER=EPR conjecture and act as holographic devices. Using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, we derive an entanglement entropy governing the thermodynamics of plancceons. This leads to a quantum-corrected Bekenstein entropy, linking wormhole geometry with quantum information flow, and suggests a holographic origin of spacetime and black hole microstructure.

## 2. The area and volume laws for entanglement of scalar fields in flat and   cosmological spacetimes

**Authors:** K. Andrzejewski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02778v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02778v1)

**Summary:**

In the Minkowski spacetime, the capacity of entanglement exhibits the area law for two kinds of geometries of the entangling surfaces: the sphere and strip. Next, we turn our attention to quenches. Namely, we analyse the dynamics of capacity; in particular, contribution of the volume and surface terms. We compare these results with theoretical predictions resulting from the quasiparticles model. In the second part, we consider the above issues for FLRW spaces; especially, for de Sitter space as well as a metric modeling the transition to radiation-dominated era.

## 3. Can Transformers help us perform parameter estimation of overlapping   signals in gravitational wave detectors?

**Authors:** Lucia Papalini, Federico De Santi, Massimiliano Razzano, Ik Siong Heng, Elena Cuoco

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02773v1)

**Summary:**

Overlapping signals represent one of the major data analysis challenges in next-generation gravitational wave detectors. We leverage Transformers and Normalizing Flows, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, to address the parameter estimation of overlapping binary black hole mergers in the Einstein Telescope (ET) We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model over simulated gravitational wave signals, showing that it maintains the same level of accuracy regardless of the correlation level in the data. The results obtained are promising and show how this approach might represent a first step toward a deep-learning based inference pipeline.

## 4. $f(R,\mathcal{G})$-cosmological dynamics in the FLRW background

**Authors:** Nikolaos Dimakis, Alex Giacomini, Genly Leon, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Ekaterina Pozdeeva, Sergey Vernov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe.

## 5. Timelike periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms around   quantum-corrected black holes

**Authors:** Jiawei Chen, Jinsong Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02660v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the periodic orbits of timelike particles around two types of static spherically symmetric quantum-corrected black hole models that satisfy covariance. We explore the impact of quantum corrections on both the particle orbits and the associated gravitational wave signals. We conclude that the first model can be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole through gravitational wave observations, whereas the second model cannot be effectively distinguished when the quantum correction is weak. We further present examples of periodic orbits at fixed particle energy for both black holes.

## 6. Evolution of innermost stable circular orbit and light ring of a charged   black hole induced by the scalarization

**Authors:** Yu-Peng Zhang, Shao-Wen Wei, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02638v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the dynamical evolution of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light ring of a charged black hole. This is achieved through nonlinear simulations within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We find that dynamical scalarization induces an increase in the areal radii of both the ISCO and the light ring. These findings provide new insights into black hole scalarized state and temporal evolution of ISCO.

## 7. Quantum Cosmology Without Singularities: A New Approach

**Authors:** Valerian A. Yurov, Artyom V. Yurov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02616v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum gravity effects are modeled by the quantum potential method associated with the ''many interacting universes'' (MIU) model. The MIU quantization method might shed light on a number of other cosmological mysteries. It might account for a decoherence which preceded the eternal inflation, and elucidate how the quantum superposition of vacuum decays occurring at different places might give birth to actual bubble universes. The new method might help explain why our universe was born in an extremely low-entropy initial state required to trigger the initial inflation.

## 8. Extended Einstein-Dirac-aether theory: Spinor modifications of the   dynamic aether kinetic term

**Authors:** Alexander B. Balakin, Anna O. Efremova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02591v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02591v1)

**Summary:**

In the framework of the Einstein-Dirac-aether theory the extended model is established. The backreaction of the spinor field on the unit vector field, describing the dynamic aether, is taken into account. The self-consistent system of master equations is derived using the variation formalism up to the second order in derivatives. For this purpose, we extended the Jacobson constitutive tensor, which enters the kinetic part of the Lagrangian of the aetheric field.

## 9. DeepHMC : a deep-neural-network acclerated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo   algorithm for binary neutron star parameter estimation

**Authors:** Jules Perret, Marc Aréne, Edward K. Porter

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02589v1)

**Summary:**

DeepHMC is a non-random walk sampler that uses background gradient information to accelerate the convergence of the sampler. We demonstrate that Hamiltonian trajectories based on a DNN gradients are 30 times faster than those based on the relative binning gradients. We show that not only does DeepHMC produce produces highly accurate and consistent results with the LVK public data, but acquires 5000 statistically independent samples in the $12D$ parameter space in approximately two hours on a Macbook pro.

## 10. Anisotropic Bianchi-I cosmological model with SU(2)-symmetric Yang-Mills   field of the magneto-electric type

**Authors:** Alexander B. Balakin, Gleb B. Kiselev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02561v1)

**Summary:**

An anisotropic cosmological model with a gauge field is considered. Bianchi-I model with axial symmetry is analyzed. New exact solution, which describes the early Universe on the stage of domination of the gauge field of the magneto-electric type, is obtained. It is presented by spatially homogeneous SU(2)-symmetric Yang-Mills potentials. The model is based on a model of the early universe with an axial symmetry of the universe.

## 11. Kinetics of relativistic axionically active plasma in the field of   dynamic aether. Part II: Particle dynamics and symptoms of plasma instability

**Authors:** Alexander B. Balakin, Kamil R. Valiullin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02551v1)

**Summary:**

In the paper [I], the first part of our work, we established the model of interaction of five elements. The initial step of analysis of this model was the reconstruction of the equilibrium states of the axionically-aetherically active plasma. In the second part of the work, presented here, in the framework of isotropic homogeneous cosmological model we consider the collisionless limit of the theory. The complete distribution functions, as exact solutions to the kinetic equations, are presented. We discuss the symptoms of plasma instability provoked by the influence of forces of the friction and tidal types.

## 12. A simple optimisation for the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array

**Authors:** Hannah Middleton, Ryan M. Shannon, Matthew Bailes, Andrew D. Cameron, Alessandro Corongiu, Marisa Geyer, Max Jones, Michael Kramer, Matthew T. Miles, Aditya Parthasarathy, Andrea Possenti, Daniel J. Reardon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02524v1)

**Summary:**

The goal of the MeerKAT radio telescope's pulsar timing array programme (MPTA) is the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of nanohertz frequencies. We consider whether small adjustments to the observing schedule can provide gains in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for a stochastic GW background signal produced by a population of massive black hole binaries. Our approach uses a greedy algorithm to reallocate available integration time between pulsars in the array.

## 13. Aspects of Geometrodynamics in the Jordan and Einstein Frames

**Authors:** Gabriele Gionti, S. J.

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02504v1)

**Summary:**

The Jordan and Einstein frames are connected through a Hamiltonian canonical transformation on the reduced phase space obtained by gauge fixing the lapse and the radial shift functions. We will discuss with particular care the problem of the boundary terms to be introduced in the general case of spherical symmetry. We introduce and discuss two static solutions (Fisher, Janis, Newman and Winicour solution in the Einstein frame and Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole Solution in the Jordan frame)

## 14. Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories

**Authors:** Alexey Golovnev, Kirill Russkov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468v1)

**Summary:**

 path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the same level of the total Hamiltonian with the primary constraints only. The idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works, we argue. We conclude by saying that there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints.

## 15. Reconciling Higgs Inflation with ACT Observations through Reheating

**Authors:** Lang Liu, Zhu Yi, Yungui Gong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02407v1)

**Summary:**

The Higgs inflation model with nonminimal coupling is disfavored by the 1$\sigma$ region of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) observational data. In this paper, we consider reheating with a constant equation of state $w_{re}$. To simultaneously satisfy the ACT data and ensure that the temperature at the end of reheating is above the threshold required for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we find that the equation must satisfy $w_re} \gtrsim 2/3$.

## 16. Phase Transitions, Shadows, and Microstructure of Kerr-anti-de Sitter   Black Holes from Geometrothermodynamics

**Authors:** Jose Miguel Ladino, Carlos E. Romero-Figueroa, Hernando Quevedo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02389v1)

**Summary:**

Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we investigate the phase-transition structure and microstructure of the Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole. By treating the curvature radius as a thermodynamic variable, we ensure scaling consistency and model the system as quasi-homogeneous. In the canonical ensemble, we identify critical points and characterize both first- and second-order phase transitions independently of pressure. We reveal a distinct phase structure, including the Hawking-Page transition.

## 17. Smarr formula for black holes with primary and secondary scalar hair

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung, Theodoros Nakas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02368v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we revisit the thermodynamics of black holes endowed with primary and secondary scalar hair in the shift and beyond Horndeski gravity. We first demonstrate that the traditional thermodynamic approach fails to yield a consistent Smarr formula for both solutions under consideration. We then derive both the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Smarr Formula, offering a consistent thermodynamic description for scalar-hairy black holes. As an additional outcome, our analysis reveals a connection between the solutions withPrimary and secondary scalpar hair.

## 18. On Charged Black Holes in Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell Theory

**Authors:** Ze Li, Hai-Shan Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02340v1)

**Summary:**

The two charged black holes branch out from the bifurcation point of the neutral ones once charge is added. The RN-like black hole approaches the RN black hole as the charge increases. Since we consider the higher-derivative Weyl square term as part of the classical gravity theory, our result sets a lower bound on the charge-to-mass ratio in the context of the Weak Gravity Conjecture. The value is less than that of the extremal RN black Hole.
