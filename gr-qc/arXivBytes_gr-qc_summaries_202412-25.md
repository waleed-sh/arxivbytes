## 0. Flowery Horizons & Bulk Observers: $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Drive in   $2d$ Holographic CFT

**Authors:** Jayashish Das, Arnab Kundu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536v1)

**Summary:**

We explore and analyze bulk geometric aspects corresponding to a driven two-dimensional holographic CFT. We demonstrate that starting with a thermal initial state, the evolution of the event horizon is characterized by distinct geometric transformations in the bulk. We also show that the explicit symmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure that displays a $U(1) \to {\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the $q\to \infty$ limit, the $U (1)$ symmetry is effectively restored.

## 1. The exact Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale-factor minisuperspace   model

**Authors:** Eftychios Kaimakkamis, Hervé Partouche, Karunava Sil, Nicolaos Toumbas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18532v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the classical minisuperspace model describing a closed, homogeneous and isotropic Universe, with a positive cosmological constant. Upon canonical quantization, the infinite number of possible operator orderings in the quantum Hamiltonian leads to distinct Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the wavefunction. Remarkably, all quantum predictions can be expressed through the combination of the two equations. This result demonstrates that all seemingly distinct quantum theories arising from different quantization schemes of the same classical model are fundamentally equivalent.

## 2. Komar charge of N = 2 supergravity and its superspace generalization

**Authors:** Igor Bandos, Patrick Meessen, Tomás Ortín

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18510v1)

**Summary:**

We find the defining equations for a Killing vector and its superpartner. We use them to construct the generalized Komar superform of minimal N=2, d=4 supergravity. The superspace procedure presented here can be used for the construction of Komar forms in more general supergravity theories. We also present the (more cumbersome) calculation of the generalized. Komar 2-form used to prove the first law in the component formalism, as an independent confirmation of our main result.

## 3. Alternative LISA-TAIJI networks: Detectability of the Parity Violation   in Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background

**Authors:** Ju Chen, Chang Liu, Yun-Long Zhang, Gang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18420v1)

**Summary:**

The detection of parity violation in the isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) will serve a crucial probe for new physics, particularly in parity-violating theories of gravity. The joint observations by the planned space-borne gravitational wave detectors, LISA and TAIJI, will offer a unique opportunity to observe such effects in the millihertz (mHz) band. The sensitivity of the LISA-TAIJIm network to parity violation is approximately one order of magnitude greater than that of theLISA- TAIJIp network at lower frequencies.

## 4. Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver   Gauge Theories

**Authors:** Pujun Liu, Rui-Dong Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359v1)

**Summary:**

We check the consistency of connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman black hole.

## 5. Search for a gravitational wave background from primordial black hole   binaries using data from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs

**Authors:** Tore Boybeyi, Sebastien Clesse, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Mairi Sakellariadou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18318v1)

**Summary:**

Using the cross-correlation data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, we search for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) from primordial black holes. We consider both early and late binary formation mechanisms, and perform Bayesian parameter inference. From the non-detection of the GWB, we provide constraints on the fraction of primordialblack holes contributing to the present dark matter energy density. We also consider different prior distributions of the model parameters.

## 6. Noether Symmetry Analysis for Generalized Brans-Dicke Cosmology

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18311v1)

**Summary:**

We present the complete solution to the classification problem regarding the variational symmetries of the generalized Brans-Dicke cosmological model. Through the symmetry analysis, we were able to specify the functional form of the field equations such that they become integrable. Additionally, new families of Integrable Cosmological models are presented. We present the results in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Astronomical Society of the UK (PRAS) on November 14, 2013.

## 7. Compact Binary Coalescence Gravitational Wave Signals Counting and   Separation Using UnMixFormer

**Authors:** Tianyu Zhao, Yue Zhou, Ruijun Shi, Peng Xu, Zhoujian Cao, Zhixiang Ren

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18259v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18259v1)

**Summary:**

Next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatories approach unprecedented sensitivities. Existing matched-filtering approaches and deep-learning techniques can typically handle only one or two concurrent signals. We present the UnMixFormer, an attention-based architecture that identifies the unknown number of concurrent compact binary coalescence GW events. Our approach adeptly processes binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems over extended time series data (16,384 samples) When evaluating on synthetic data with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 10 to 50, our method achieves 99.89% counting accuracy.

## 8. Structure and statistical properties of the semiclassical Einstein   equations

**Authors:** Daniel R. Terno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18213v1)

**Summary:**

We treat the semiclassical Einstein equation as a quantum-classical hybrid. This approach identifies the left-hand side of the equation as the expectation value of the Einstein tensor given the state of matter. As a result, standard criticisms of semiclassicals gravity do not apply. stochastic gravity emerges as a necessary extension to the Einstein equation. We show the formal equivalence of its two derivation methods. We conclude that this approach is the most appropriate way to study Einstein's equation.

## 9. Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum   gravity II: A new solution without Cauchy horizons

**Authors:** Wentao Liu, Di Wu, Jieci Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18083v1)

**Summary:**

The third type of black hole is free of Cauchy horizons, and was only recently obtained. This solution can describe a black hole with an event horizon for certain parameter ranges, or a horizonless compact object beyond those ranges. We show that its light rings feature both stable and unstable branches, and that the black hole shadow size grows with the quantum parameter. This feature can serve as a hallmark of black holes in EQG, offering a potential way to distinguish them from their GR counterparts.

## 10. Covariant LTB collapse in models of loop quantum gravity

**Authors:** Martin Bojowald, Erick I. Duque, Dennis Hartmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18054v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18054v1)

**Summary:**

 models of gravitational collapse provide important means to test whether non-classical space-time effects motivated for instance by quantum gravity can be realized in generic ways in physically relevant situations. Here, a detailed analysis of marginally bound Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi space-times is given in emergent modified gravity. As a result, generic collapse in this setting is shown to imply a physical singularity that removes the bouncing behavior seen in vacuum space- times with the same type of modifications.
