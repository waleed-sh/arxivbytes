## Non-local positivity bounds: islands in Terra Incognita

**Authors:** Luca Buoninfante, Long-Qi Shao, Anna Tokareva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08634v1)

**Summary:**

The requirements of unitarity and causality lead to significant constraints on the Wilson coefficients of a EFT expansion. The scope of this work is to clarify the role of locality by deriving generalized positivity bounds under the assumption of exponential boundedness. Our results have far-reaching implications for the question of the uniqueness of string theory as the only consistent ultraviolet completion beyond the framework of local QFT. We show that there exist ETFs that satisfy IR causality and at the same time can admit a non-local UV completion, provided the energy scale of non-locality is of the same order or smaller than the EFT cutoff.

## Testing the equivalence principle across the Universe: a   model-independent approach with galaxy multi-tracing

**Authors:** Sveva Castello, Ziyang Zheng, Camille Bonvin, Luca Amendola

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08627v1)

**Summary:**

We present a test of the equivalence principle on cosmological scales involving minimal assumptions. Our approach relies on the cross-correlation of two different galaxy populations with large-scale relativistic corrections. We construct a measurable quantity $E_P$ acting as a null test, i.e. deviating from unity whenever the weak equivalence Principle is violated. We forecast a precision around 10-15$\%$ across the redshift range between 0.25 and 0.75.

## A New Approach to the Low Frequency Stochastic Gravitational Wave   Background: Constraints from Quasars and the Astrometric Hellings-Downs Curve

**Authors:** Jeremy Darling

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08605v1)

**Summary:**

We present new constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background and construct the first astrometric Hellings-Downs curve using quasar proper motions. From quadrupolar vector spherical harmonic fits to the Gaia proper motions of 1,108,858 quasars, we obtain a frequency-integrated upper limit on the gravitational wave energy density. This is also the first time that optical wavelength astrometry surpasses limits from radio-frequency interferometry. The limits presented here may exclude some exotic interpretations of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave background.

## On the low-energy limit of stationary and axisymmetric solutions in   General Relativity

**Authors:** Davide Astesiano, Matteo Luca Ruggiero

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08598v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08598v1)

**Summary:**

We study the low-energy limit of General Relativity in the presence of stationarity and axial symmetry, coupled to dust. We demonstrate that differences between the dynamics of Generalrelativity and those of Newtonian gravity persist even in the weak-field and slow-motion regime. We provide a pedagogical discussion of how these discrepancies arise and outline a systematic procedure to solve the equations of motion for such systems. We present analytical results for specific cases and also give the general solution for the vacuum case.

## A stress tensor for asymptotically flat spacetime

**Authors:** Jay Bhambure, Hare Krishna

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08588v1)

**Summary:**

The stress tensor correctly reproduces the Brown-York charges for the Kerr blackhole i.e. mass and angular momentum. The asymptotic charges can be compared with the Wald-Zoupas method. Our result can be interpreted as the expectation value for the boundary stress Tensor of a gravitational theory in flat spacetime. We also compute the charges associated with these symmetries with the proposed stress tensors. The results are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## pp-Waves and the Hidden Symmetries of Black Hole Quasinormal Modes

**Authors:** Daniel Kapec, Ahmed Sheta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08551v1)

**Summary:**

There are two interesting classes of trapped null geodesics in any black hole spacetime: those that lie on the photon ring and those that generate the horizon. Recent work introduced a "near-ring" scaling limit that exhibits the emergent symmetries of the eikonal quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum. This analysis was reformulated geometrically by Fransen using the Penrose limit, which produces pp-waves fromGeodesics. We elaborate on and generalize various aspects of this construction for the Schwarzschild black hole.

## Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy

**Authors:** Jiayue Yang, Niayesh Afshordi, Mahdi Torabian, Seyed Akbar Jafari, G. Baskaran

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08517v1)

**Summary:**

In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. We compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one.

## Observational Features of Thin Accretion Disk Around Rotating Regular   Black Hole

**Authors:** Zhen Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08447v1)

**Summary:**

Rotating regular black hole offer a phenomenological model that resolves spacetime singularities. The regular parameter significantly impacts the observables, enhancing the radiation efficiency of thin accretion disk and contracting the lensing bands of black hole image, compared to Kerr black hole. These effects become more pronounced for rapidly rotating regular black holes and large inclination angels, making them more detectable in astrophysical observations. The study was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics,Volume 3, Issue 1. For more, visit www.astronomyandastrophysics.org.

## Pulsar Kick: Status and Perspective

**Authors:** Gaetano Lambiase, Tanmay Kumar Poddar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08446v1)

**Summary:**

High speeds seen in rapidly rotating pulsars after supernova explosions present a longstanding puzzle in astrophysics. Numerous theories have been suggested over the years to explain this sudden "kick" imparted to the neutron star. Key explanations for pulsar kicks include hydrodynamic instabilities in supernovae, anisotropic neutrino emission, asymmetries in the magnetic field, binary system disruption, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Unraveling the origins of pulsar kick not only enhances our understanding of supernova mechanisms but also opens up possibilities for exploring new physics.

## A new class of semiclassical gravity solutions, gravitational quantum   stealths and regular Cauchy horizons

**Authors:** Benito A. Juárez-Aubry

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402v1)

**Summary:**

We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the system is quasi-linear hyperbolic. If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship. We provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassicals gravity without spacetime symmetries.

## Geodesics, accretion disk, gravitational lensing, time delay, and   effects on neutrinos induced by a non-commutative black hole

**Authors:** A. A. Araújo Filho, N. Heidari, Ali Övgün

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08369v1)

**Summary:**

This paper explores gravitational phenomena associated with a non-commutative black hole. Geodesic equations are derived, and a thin accretion disk is analyzed to model the black hole shadow image. Retrolensing effects are examined to trace photon emission configurations. gravitational lensing is investigated through weak and strong deflection limits, with lensing equations and observables applied to Sagittarius A*. The study also includes calculations of time delay, energy deposition rate from neutrino annihilation, phase and probability of neutrinos oscillation.

## PADÉ FILTERING, Principles and Use: an Introductory Report

**Authors:** Jean-Daniel Fournier, Mikhaël Pichot du Mézeray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08254v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08254v1)

**Summary:**

This report aims to provide gravitational waves data analysts with an introduction to the ideas and practice of the Pad\'e Filtering method for disentangling a signal from the noise. Technically it comes to the tracking of the zeros and singularities of random z-Transforms by noisyPad\'e Approximants. It also aims to show how to use the method to identify gravitational waves in space and time, and how to detect them in the Earth’s atmosphere.

## The Vanishing of the Non-linear Static Love Number of Kerr Black Holes   and the Role of Symmetries

**Authors:** L. -R. Gounis, A. Kehagias, A. Riotto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08249v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08249v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the tidal response of Kerr black holes in four-dimensional space-times subjected to external gravitational fields. Using the Ernst formalism and Weyl coordinates, we analyze the non-linear tidal deformation of rotating black holes. We show that their static tidal Love numbers vanish at all orders of the external tidal field. We also show that this result is intimately related to the presence of underlying non- linear symmetries. Our analysis generalizes previous findings for Schwarzschild black holes and confirms the robustness of four- dimensional black holes against tidal forces.

## Quasi-normal modes of slowly-rotating Johannsen black holes

**Authors:** Yuhao Guo, Swarnim Shashank, Cosimo Bambi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08205v1)

**Summary:**

The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser interferometers has opened a new window to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the strong, dynamical, and non-linear regime. In this paper, we study the quasi-normal modes of gravitational perturbations of Johannsen black holes under the assumptions of the validity of the Einstein Equations and of low values of the black hole spin parameter and deformation parameters. We find that the data of GW170104 are consistent with the predictions of GR.

## Effective description of open quantum dynamics in relativistic   scattering

**Authors:** Kaito Kashiwagi, Akira Matsumura

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08154v1)

**Summary:**

Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator describes the evolution of the particles. The GKSL generator is characterized by a Lorentz-invariant function of initial momenta. In the pair annihilation process, we show that the probability of pair annihilation varies depending on the superposition state of incident scalar $phi$ particles. This means that the description by the GK SL generator with Poincar\'e symmetry is effective for the asymptotic behavior of open quantum dynamics in the long-term processes.

## Enhancement of small-scale induced gravitational waves from the   soliton/oscillon domination

**Authors:** Xiao-Bin Sui, Jing Liu, Rong-Gen Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08057v1)

**Summary:**

Long-lived solitons and oscillons can dominate the early Universe and drive reheating prior to the standard radiation-dominated era. Scalar-induced GWs with characteristic energy spectra emerge from these amplified curvature perturbations, particularly at the sudden transition from matter domination to radiation domination. We analyze this scenario and its GW predictions in detail, focusing on the impact of the initial energy fraction, the lifetime, and the average separation. This provides a wealth of potential observational targets for various GW detectors.

## Testing linear-quadratic GUP modified Kerr Black hole using EHT results

**Authors:** Sohan Kumar Jha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08030v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum gravity effect is incorporated into a black hole (BH) by modifying its ADM mass. The linear-quadratic Generalized uncertainty principle (LQG) is consistent with predictions of a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum put forth by various theories of quantum gravity. In this article, we explore the impact of GUP on the optical properties of an LQG modified \k BH (L QKBH) We analyze the horizon structure of the BH, which reveals a critical spin value of $7M/8$.

## Geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired spacetime

**Authors:** Douglas M. Gingrich, Saeed Rastgoo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08004v1)

**Summary:**

We examine the geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical curvature singularity. In Schwarzschild coordinates, the $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition surface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic congruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $ r = 0$, indicating a repulsive gravitational core.
