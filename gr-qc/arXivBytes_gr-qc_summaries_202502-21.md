**Authors:** Sophie Hoyland, Hans A. Winther, Daniela Saadeh, Kazuya Koyama, Albert Izard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14851v1)

**Summary:**

Accurate predictions of weak lensing observables are essential for understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and probing the nature of gravity. We present a lightcone implementation to generate maps of the weak Lensing convergence field using the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method. The convergence power spectrum is accurate to within $5\%$ up to $5,000. We extend our analyses to two representative theories of Modified Gravity, and demonstrate their imprints on the five convergence statistics considered.

## 1. Primordial full bispectra from the general bounce cosmology

**Authors:** Shingo Akama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14850v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14850v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial non-Gaussianities are key quantities to test early universe scenarios. We study the auto- and cross-bispectra originating from the scale-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations in the general bounce model. We find that the differences between the two branches manifest for equilateral and squeezed momentum triangle configurations. By examining perturbativity conditions and considering current observational constraints, we also find a viable parameter space in which both theoretical and observational constraints are satisfied simultaneously.

## 2. PETRA: From the global fit for LISA's Galactic binaries to a catalog of   sources

**Authors:** Aaron D. Johnson, Javier Roulet, Katerina Chatziioannou, Michele Vallisneri, Chris G. Trejo, Kyle A. Gersbach

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14818v1)

**Summary:**

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect mHz gravitational waves from many astrophysical sources. The large number of signals overlapping in the LISA dataset requires a global fit in which an unknown number of sources are modeled simultaneously. This introduces a label-switching ambiguity for sources in the same class. We present a method to construct a catalog by optimally relabeling samples from the global-fit posterior to minimize the statistical divergence between the global fit and a factorized catalog representation. Our method is implemented in the open-source Python package petra_catalogs.

## 3. Entanglement entropy evolution during gravitational collapse

**Authors:** Alessio Belfiglio, Orlando Luongo, Stefano Mancini, Sebastiano Tomasi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14797v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the dynamics of the ground state entanglement entropy for a discretized scalar field propagating within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse metric. Starting from a well-controlled initial configuration, we follow the system as it evolves toward the formation of a horizon and, eventually, a singularity. Close to the horizon, the entropy can deviate from the simple area law, reflecting the rapid changes in geometry and field configuration. Although the model is idealized, these results provide insights into the generation and scaling ofEntanglement in the presence of realistic, dynamically evolving gravitational fields.

## 4. Geometric analysis for the Pontryagin action and boundary terms

**Authors:** Jasel Berra-Montiel, Iñaki de Santos, Alberto Molgado

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14756v1)

**Summary:**

In this article, we analyze the Pontryagin model adopting different geometric-covariant approaches. In particular, we focus on the manner in which boundary conditions must be imposed on the background manifold in order to reproduce an unambiguous theory on the boundary. At a Lagrangian level, we describe the symmetries of the theory and construct the Lagrangians. Through the multisymplectic analysis we obtain the covariant momentum map associated with the action of the gauge group on the multimomenta phase-space.

## 5. Purely metric Horndeski theories and spontaneous curvaturization of   black holes

**Authors:** Astrid Eichhorn, Pedro G. S. Fernandes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14717v1)

**Summary:**

We explore purely metric theories of gravity with second-order equations of motion and a single additional, purely gravitational, propagating, scalar degree of freedom. We identify a subclass of these theories in which this scalar causes a phenomenon similar to black-hole scalarization, which we call curvaturization. Around small enough Kerr black holes, the scalar induces a tachyonic instability. This triggers a sudden growth of Ricci curvature and results in a new branch of vacuum black- hole solutions.

## 6. Effective field theory reproducing the MOND phenomenology based on a   non-Abelian Yang-Mills graviphoton

**Authors:** Luc Blanchet, Emeric Seraille

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14686v1)

**Summary:**

Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant. We show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a fundamental violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime.

## 7. Dynamical dark energy with AdS-to-dS and dS-to-dS transitions:   Implications for the $H_0$ tension

**Authors:** Özgür Akarsu, Leandros Perivolaropoulos, Anna Tsikoundoura, A. Emrah Yükselci, Alexander Zhuk

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14667v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the dynamics and cosmological implications of dark energy (DE), modeled as a scalar field with a hyperbolic tangent potential. Despite the negative kinetic term, the step-like form of the potential prevents pathologies such as unbounded energy growth, Big Rip, and violations of the WEC. While the phantom field's energy density and pressure remain finite throughout, its EoS exhibits a safe singularity as its energy density smoothly crosses zero. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for the $H_0$ scenario.

## 8. The massive BMS character in 3D quantum gravity

**Authors:** T. Mursheed Amith, Alicia Castro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14578v1)

**Summary:**

Asymptotic symmetries provide a natural framework for describing particles in quantum gravity where spacetimes highly fluctuate. Similar techniques have also been applied to systems with boundaries at finite distances. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional quantum gravity on a finite-radius twisted thermal flat background with a conical defect, representing a test point particle. By computing the one-loop partition function in both discrete and continuum geometry settings, we recover the massive BMS$_3$ character. The additional modes, compared to the vacuum case, arise from broken diffeomorphism symmetry.

## 9. Modeling coupled constellation dynamics for TianQin under self-gravity

**Authors:** Yuzhou Fang, Xuefeng Zhang, Hongyin Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14552v1)

**Summary:**

TianQin is a dedicated geocentric mission for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection. Among its core technologies, the drag-free and pointing control subsystem (DFPCS) keeps the two test masses (TMs) centered and aligned. This results in orbit-attitude coupled dynamics for the constellation. The coupling is made more prominent due to satellite self-gravity, which requires compensation from DFPCS and generally makes the satellites deviate from pure free-fall orbits.

## 10. Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves

**Authors:** Or Dobkowski, Barak Trok, Peter Skakunenko, Yonathan Japha, David Groswasser, Maxim Efremov, Chiara Marletto, Ivette Fuentes, Roger Penrose, Vlatko Vedral, Wolfgang P. Schleich, Ron Folman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence. This asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame. In the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase. This is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two different accelerating frames. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the interface between quantum theory and gravity.

## 11. Geometric Aspects of Type IIA Supersymmetric Backgrounds and Heterotic   Anomalies

**Authors:** J. Phillips

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14517v1)

**Summary:**

We construct twisted covariant form hierarchies of (massive) type IIA supergravity for common sector, D-brane and warped product AdS supersymmetric backgrounds. The Killing spinor bilinears satisfy a generalisation of the conformal Killing-Yano equation with respect to the TCFH connections. The interplay between TCFHs and hidden symmetries of probes propagating on these backgrounds is investigated and used to explore the question of whether charges are sufficient to prove the integrability of such probes on this class of backgrounds.

## 12. On JT gravity path integrals and the tunneling process

**Authors:** Hamed Zolfi, Mohsen Alishahiha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14448v1)

**Summary:**

The Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity path integral of the trumpet can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an older black hole to a younger one, accompanied by the emission of a baby universe. This interpretation becomes less straightforward for geometries with higher genus and multiple geodesic boundaries. In this paper, we examine the path integral for these more complex geometry and find that maintaining this interpretation requires accounting for a portion of the moduli space. We conclude that the interpretation of the JT path integral is more complex than previously thought.

## 13. Dragging of inertial frames in the composed Kerr-Newman-orbiting-ring   system

**Authors:** Shahar Hod

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14310v1)

**Summary:**

The dragging of inertial frames by an orbiting object implies that the horizon angular velocity of a central black hole is no longer related to its angular-momentum. Using a continuity argument, it has recently been revealed that the composed Kerr-ring system is characterized by the universal (that is, spin-{\it independent}) relation. In the present compact paper we explore the physical phenomenon of dragging of inertia by a ring in the Kerr-Newman-black-hole-orbiting- ring system.
