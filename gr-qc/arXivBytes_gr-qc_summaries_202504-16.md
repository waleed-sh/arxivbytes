## 0. Ghostly interactions in (1+1) dimensional classical field theory

**Authors:** Cédric Deffayet, Aaron Held, Shinji Mukohyama, Alexander Vikman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11437v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the classical stability of two coupled scalar fields with opposite-sign kinetic terms evolving in 1+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In the first part, we characterise unquenched ghostly interactions and present numerical solutions that support the following statements. We demonstrate that heavy high-frequency ghost fields seem to not violate the decoupling theorem and can be integrated out classically. And we demonstrate how self-interactions can quench the instability, for instance, by postponing its onset to parametrically large times.

## 1. The 2D Lorentz-violating fermionic Casimir effect under thermal   conditions

**Authors:** K. E. L. de Farias, M. A. Anacleto, Iver Brevik, F. A. Brito, E. Passos, Amilcar Queiroz, João R. L. Santos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11430v1)

**Summary:**

In the present work, we explore the dimensional projection method applied to a fermionic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) theory with the CPT-even dimension-six extension. For each thermal observable, the influence of the LIV correction term is considered in the analysis of both low- and high-temperature regimes. The Matsubara formalism is applied to derive closed expressions for the influence. of temperature on the physical observables: Casimir energy, Casimir force, and entropy associated with the system.

## 2. Cosmological model in the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity   with quadratic equation of state parameter

**Authors:** Vinod Kumar Bhardwaj, Saibal Ray

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11422v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we have explored a transitioning cosmological model of universe's expansion. The model parameters are estimated taking observational datasets of BAO, Pantheon, and CC using MCMC analysis. Some dynamical properties like EOS parameter, energy density, pressure, and deceleration parameter are described. The energy conditions are also examined to validate the viability of the proposed model. We observe a transition redshift at $z_{t} = 0.942^{+0.112}_{-0.164}$

## 3. Five dimensional rotating and Quintessence black hole and their shadows

**Authors:** Milko Estrada, L. C. N. Santos, M. S. Cunha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11408v1)

**Summary:**

We present a new five-dimensional rotating quintessence black hole solution. We employ the $5D$ version of the Janis Newman algorithm, which incorporates the Hopf bifurcation. For the study of the shadow, we followed a novel approach in which the $2D$ shadow observed by humans corresponds to cross-sections of the $3D$shadow. We also propose a speculative methodology to test the shadow behavior in five- dimensional scenarios, in light of the constraints provided by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)

## 4. Gravitational waves in massive Horndeski theory with a cosmological   constant

**Authors:** Hatice Özer, Özgür Delice

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11378v1)

**Summary:**

We study gravitational waves in a de-Sitter background in linearized Horndeski theory. This background can be obtained in different ways in this theory. The scalar field has long range whereas its potential can induce a mass term, rendering its range to short distances. The minimum of the scalar potential term mimics a cosmological constant and leads to separate redshifts in the effective frequency and wave number, which also discriminates the tensorial and massive scalar waves. We discuss properties of the gravitational waves, their propagation and interaction with the medium in which they propagate.

## 5. Fast detection and reconstruction of merging Massive Black Hole Binary   signals

**Authors:** Senwen Deng, Stanislav Babak, Sylvain Marsat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11322v1)

**Summary:**

Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational waves from the population of merging massive black holes binaries (MBHBs) Most of the MBHB signals will be loud enough to be detected days or even weeks before the merger. For those sources LISA will be able to predict the time of the merger well in advance of the coalescence, as well as an approximate position in the sky. We propose: (i) a detection scheme for MBHB mergers allowing a first subtraction of these signals for the purpose of a global fit.

## 6. Constraints on Generalized Gravity-Thermodynamic Cosmology from DESI DR2

**Authors:** Udit K. Tyagi, Sandeep Haridasu, Soumen Basak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11308v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the cosmological implications of generalized entropic models within the framework of Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) approaches. These models, characterized by three or four additional free parameters, are designed to capture deviations from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our Bayesian analysis, which incorporates the Pantheon+ and DESy5 supernovae data alongside the recently released DESI-DR2/DR1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, shows that the data favor the standard.

## 7. Relic gravitational waves from primordial gravitational collapses

**Authors:** Xiang-Xi Zeng, Zhuan Ning, Zi-Yan Yuwen, Shao-Jiang Wang, Heling Deng, Rong-Gen Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11275v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11275v1)

**Summary:**

A large primordial density perturbation of the Hubble scale will gravitationally collapse, generating an outgoing sound shell whether or not a primordial black hole is formed. The peak frequency and amplitude in the GW spectrum depend on the Hubble horizon and the abundance of sound shells. Future null detection of the corresponding high-frequency GW background could put new observational constraints on those PBHs that have already evaporated. For those perturbations that collapse intoPBHs, future null detection could putnew observational constraints.

## 8. Can Quasi Periodic Oscillations Encode Traces of Black Hole Phase   Transitions ?

**Authors:** Bidyut Hazarika, Prabwal Phukon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11205v1)

**Summary:**

Findings suggest that black hole phase transitions can be influenced by quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) The presence of distinct phase structures remains evident across all models, which is an encouraging outcome that may be worth exploring further in the context of other black hole systems. The analysis is further extended to other QPO models, including the Warped Disk (WD) and Epicyclic Resonance (ER) models. The results are published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 9. More fields are different: Stochastic view of multi-field inflationary   scenario

**Authors:** Tomo Takahashi, Koki Tokeshi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11158v1)

**Summary:**

High-energy physics often motivates multi-field inflationary scenarios. The noise-induced centrifugal force results in a longer duration of inflation depending on the number of fields, even when the stochastic noises themselves are small. Our results indicate that inflation with an extremely large number of. fields may fail to realise our observable Universe. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of High-energy Physics, published by the journal of the Royal Astronomical Society in London, UK.

## 10. Testing Non-Coincident $f(Q)$-gravity with DESI DR2 BAO and GRBs

**Authors:** Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11132v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11132v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the $f\left( Q \right) $-theory for the description of dark energy with a non-trivial connection defined in the non-coincident gauge. The resulting field equations form a two-scalar-field, quintom-like gravitational model. We constrain this dark energy model using the the baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and gamma-ray bursts. The cosmological data provides $n \simeq0.33 $.

## 11. Classification of Einstein spaces with Stackel metric of type (3.0)

**Authors:** V. V. Obukhov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11084v1)

**Summary:**

The Einstein spaces with the Stackel metric of the (3.0) have been done. These spaces are invariant under the action of the three-parameter abelian group of motions. They belong to the first type Bianchi spaces. The complete list of metrics of such spaces in privileged coordinate systems is given. The classification of vacuum and electrovacuum Stackels of all types is completed. The list of the metrics for such spaces is also given in the appendix.

## 12. Lorentzian homogeneous Ricci-flat metrics on almost abelian Lie groups

**Authors:** Yuichiro Sato, Takanao Tsuyuki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11077v1)

**Summary:**

We study Lorentzian homogeneous metrics on almost abelian Lie groups of dimensions larger than three. In particular, we generalize the four-dimensional Petrov solution to arbitrarily higher dimensions. Ricci-flat and non-flat conditions on the Lie algebra are derived. We show that a Lie group whose Lie algebra has a codimension one abelia ideal is an almost-abelian group. We also show that this Lie group has a Lie algebra that has acodimension two.

## 13. Pseudospectral implementation of the Einstein-Maxwell system

**Authors:** Jorge Expósito Patiño, Hannes R. Rüter, David Hilditch

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11069v1)

**Summary:**

Electromagnetism plays an important role in a variety of applications in gravity that we wish to investigate. We present an implementation of the Maxwell equations within the adaptive-mesh pseudospectral numerical relativity code bamps. Our simulations demonstrate rapid convergence of error with resolution, as well as consistency with known quasinormal decay rates on the Kerr background. Finally we present evolutions of the electrovacuum equations of motion with strong data, a good representation of typical critical collapse runs.

## 14. Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations

**Authors:** Axel Maas, Simon Plätzer, Felix Pressler

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047v1)

**Summary:**

The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes.

## 15. Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact   objects

**Authors:** Ch. D. Giannios, P. S. Koliogiannis, Ch. C. Moustakidis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.

## 16. Analytical coordinate time at the second post-Newtonian order

**Authors:** Vittorio De Falco, Marco Gallo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029v1)

**Summary:**

We derive the analytical expression of the coordinate time $t$ in terms of the eccentric anomaly $u$ at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. This effort reveals to be extremely useful for application purposes. We need to truncate the aforementioned sum to a certain finite threshold, which strongly depends on the selected parameter values and the accuracy error we would like to achieve. Thanks to our work, this analysis can be easily carried out.

## 17. The effects of asymptotically flat $R^2$ spacetime on black hole image   of Sagittarius A*

**Authors:** Jian-Ming Yan, Tao Zhu, Qiang Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10956v1)

**Summary:**

A new class of analytically expressible vacuum solutions has recently been discovered for pure ${R}^2$ gravity. These solutions, inspired by Buchdahl's framework, offer a promising avenue for testing gravitational theories against astrophysical observations. In this study, we employ the publicly available code \textit{ipole} to simulate black hole images under the Buchdahl-inspired metric. Our simulations show that both the shadow size and photon ring diameter decrease monotonically with increasing $\epsilon$

## 18. The path towards measuring the gravitational field of proton bunches at   accelerators

**Authors:** Daniel Braun, Rongrong Cai, Pascal Hermes, Marta Maria Marchese, Stefan Nimmrichter, Christian Pfeifer, Dennis Rätzel, Stefano Redaelli, Hendrik Ulbricht

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10942v1)

**Summary:**

Post Minkowskian predictions for the gravitational field of ultra-relativistic matter, dominated by momentum instead of rest mass, have not been tested directly yet. If successful, this would open the road to a novel use case of the LHC, where non-trivial gravitational physics could be studied likely in a parasitic mode, without the necessity of dedicated filling patterns. While the technical challenges are formidable, they should also lead to the development ofUltra-high-sensitive acceleration sensors with abundant applications in other parts of science and technology.

## 19. Gravitational Entropy of Hayward Black Hole

**Authors:** Hideo Iguchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10890v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the gravitational entropy defined by the Weyl curvature for the Hayward black hole, which is one of the regular black holes without singularity in the event horizon. We derive an expression for the curvature tensor that is as independent as possible of the parameter added to the black hole and give an equation for the entropy measure explicitly independent of that parameter. We discuss the effect of singularity resolution on gravitational entropy and discuss possible improvements in the definition of gravitational entropy. The gravitational entropy density used in previous studies presents questions from the standpoint of mathematical rigor.

## 20. Non-Minimal RT Coupling and its Impact on Inflationary Evolution in f(R,   T) Gravity

**Authors:** Sohan Kumar Jha, Anisur Rahaman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10876v1)

**Summary:**

We examine inflationary models in the $f(R, T)$ gravity framework. We have a conformal constant and an $RT$-mixing term apart from an R term. The RT- Mixing term introduces non-minimal coupling between gravity and matter. We find the existence of two local maxima of $n_s$ which occur at a negative and a positive value of the coefficient of the RT-Mixing term. We also display the variation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index.

## 21. Testing redshift variation of the X-ray and ultraviolet luminosity   relations of quasars

**Authors:** Jiayi Wu, Yang Liu, Hongwei Yu, Puxun Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10862v1)

**Summary:**

Quasars serve as important cosmological probes and constructing accurate luminosity relations for them is essential for their use in cosmology. If the coefficients of quasar's luminosity relation vary with redshift, it could introduce biases into Cosmological constraints derived from quasars. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the redshift variation in the X-ray luminosity and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ($L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_ \mathrm {UV}$) relations of qu asars. We find that the relation coefficients exhibit a strong and linear correlation with red shift.

## 22. Universal thermodynamic topological classes of three-dimensional BTZ   black holes

**Authors:** Ying Chen, Xiao-Dan Zhu, Di Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10858v1)

**Summary:**

We establish a universal thermodynamic topological classification for three-dimensional static neutral, charged, and rotating BTZ black holes. In the low-temperature limit, all three cases exhibit a thermodynamically stable small black hole state. This reveals a fundamental dichotomy: while angular momentum and electric charge dominate the thermodynamic. topology of four-dimensionalstatic black holes, their effects become negligible in the three- dimensional static BTZ case, highlighting a dimension-driven divergence in black hole thermodynamic behavior.

## 23. Quantum Geometry of the Light Cone: Fock representation and Spectrum of   Radiated Power

**Authors:** Wolfgang Wieland

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10802v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10802v1)

**Summary:**

We identify an auxiliary conformal field theory (CFT), which carries a representation of the constraint algebra of general relativity on a null surface. We study the resulting quantum theory for both bosonic and fermionic representations. A negative central charge implies a non-unitary CFT, which has negative norm states. In this way, we obtain a bound on the radiated power of gravitational waves in the model. This in turn suggests to apply it to an entire null foliation in an asymptotically flat spacetime.
