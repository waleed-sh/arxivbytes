## 0. Towards a Composite Framework for Simultaneous Exploration of New   Physics in Background and Perturbed Universes

**Authors:** Shibendu Gupta Choudhury, Purba Mukherjee, Anjan Ananda Sen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18457v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18457v1)

**Summary:**

The background is characterized by two parameters, $A$ and $B$, which reduce to $2/3$ in the $Lambda$CDM limit. The growth of structures is captured through a new fitting function for $f\sigma_8$ involving the growth index $\gamma$. Using recent observational datasets, we find significant evidence for departures from the CDM. We also demonstrate that future high-precision RSD data could unveil correlations between background and perturbation parameters that are currently suppressed.

## 1. Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from   supercooled phase transitions

**Authors:** Adam Gonstal, Marek Lewicki, Bogumila Swiezewska

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18436v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18436v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves come from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly.

## 2. Perturbative solutions for compact objects in (2+1)-dimensional   Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics

**Authors:** R. V. Maluf, J. E. G. Silva, C. A. S. Almeida, Gonzalo J. Olmo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18398v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18398v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the space-time geometry generated by compact objects in Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics. Using a perturbative approach, we derive a charged BTZ-like black hole solution. Our analysis suggests that the near-horizon and inner structure of the solution remain unaltered, indicating that no new non-black hole objects emerge in this regime. In particular, we do not find evidence of wormhole solutions in the (2+1)-dimensional version of this theory.

## 3. Preliminary Sensitivity Study for a Gravitational Redshift Measurement   with China's Lunar Exploration Project

**Authors:** Cheng-Gang Qin, Tong Liu, Xiao-Yi Dai, Peng-Bin Guo, Weisheng Huang, Xiang-Pei Liu, Yu-Jie Tan, Cheng-Gang Shao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18362v1)

**Summary:**

General relativity describes gravity as a geometric phenomenon. The gravitational redshift, a classic test of GR, can potentially be violated in alternative gravity theories. China's Lunar Exploration Project (CLEP) is proposed to equip the deep-space H maser with a daily stability of $2\times10^{-15}$, which provides an approach for testing gravitational red Shift. If the issue of frequency offset and drift is solved, CLEP missions have the potential of testing the gravitational red shift with high accuracy.

## 4. Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators

**Authors:** Konstantinos Dialektopoulos, Theodoros Papanikolaou, Vasilios Zarikas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m < 5$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era.

## 5. Universal relations for non-rotating objects made of dark energy

**Authors:** G. Panotopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18338v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18338v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain universal relations for fluid spheres without rotation made of dark energy assuming the Extended-Chaplygin Gas equation-of-state. After integrating the relevant differential equations, we make a fit to obtain the unknown coefficients of the functions. We find that the form of the function does not depend on the details of the underlying equation- of-state and that the coefficients are not related to the shape of the sphere.

## 6. Thermal origin of the attractor-to-general-relativity in scalar-tensor   gravity

**Authors:** Valerio Faraoni, Andrea Giusti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18272v1)

**Summary:**

The convergence of scalar-tensor gravity to general relativity, or the departure from it, are described in a new analogy with heat dissipation in a viscous fluid. This new thermal picture is applied to cosmology, shedding light on whether gravity deviates from general relativity early on and approaches it later in the cosmic history. It also sheds light on how gravity could have evolved in the universe's early history, such as the formation of the universe as we know it. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 7. Viscosity, entanglement and acceleration

**Authors:** Dmitry D. Lapygin, Georgy Yu. Prokhorov, Oleg V. Teryaev, Valentin I. Zakharov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18199v1)

**Summary:**

The Minkowski vacuum in an accelerated frame behaves like a fluid that has a finite temperature. The origin of this viscosity is believed to be related to entanglement introduced by the Rindler horizon. We show that locally the ratio of vis cosity to entropy density can be below the limiting value $ 1/4\pi $ at distances of the order of the thickness of the membrane corresponding to the stretched horizon. In particular, on the membrane surface $ \eta/s=1/8\pi$

## 8. Emergence of running vacuum energy in $f(R,T)$ gravity : Observational   constraints

**Authors:** Ahmed Errahmani, Mounia Magrach, Safae Dahmani, Amine Bouali, Taoufik Ouali

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18193v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we present a new analysis for $f(R,T)$ gravity by exploring the energy momentum tensor. We demonstrate that gravity with the form $f('R', 'T') is equivalent to Running Vacuum Energy (RVE) RVE interacts with the components of the cosmic fluid, namely dark matter and radiation. We find that the parameters characterizing the RVE model are very small as expected. Finally, the interaction of the running vacuum increases the value of the currentvalue of the Hubble rate by $3.5%.

## 9. Bispectrum at NLO in single field inflation: conservation and squeezed   limit

**Authors:** Ignatios Antoniadis, Auttakit Chatrabhuti, Jules Cunat, Hiroshi Isono

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18187v1)

**Summary:**

In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation. We found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.

## 10. Parametric solutions to the Kerr separatrix

**Authors:** Tammy Ng, Edward Teo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18141v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18141v1)

**Summary:**

The Kerr separatrix is a boundary in parameter space that separates bound orbits from plunging orbits in the Kerr black hole space-time. Recently, Stein and Warburton found a polynomial equation for the location of the separatrix, for two different choices of inclination parameter. We use a correspondence between homoclinic orbits and unstable spherical orbits to derive explicit solutions. These solutions are parametrised in terms of the radius of the unstable spherical orbit. The solution for the equatorial case is given by Levin and Perez-Giz.

## 11. Towards robust gravitational wave detections from individual   supermassive black hole binaries

**Authors:** Bence Bécsy, Neil J. Cornish, Polina Petrov, Xavier Siemens, Stephen R. Taylor, Sarah J. Vigeland, Caitlin A. Witt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18114v1)

**Summary:**

The recent discovery of the stochastic gravitational-wave background via pulsar timing arrays will likely be followed by the detection of individual black hole binaries that stand out above the background. To confidently claim the Detection of an individual binary, we need not only more and better data, but also more sophisticated analysis techniques. In this paper, we develop two new approaches that can help us more robustly ascertain if a candidate found by a search algorithm is indeed an individual supermassive black hole binary. The methods work well in correctly identifying both true gravitational waves and false positives.

## 12. Shadow Cast by the Kerr MOG Black Hole under the Influence of Plasma and   Constraints from EHT Observations

**Authors:** Saira Yasmin, Khadije Jafarzade, Mubasher Jamil

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18071v1)

**Summary:**

The study of black hole (BH) shadows provide crucial insights into the nature of strong gravitational effects and the intricate structure of the spacetime surrounding BHs. In this paper, we explore the shadow of Kerr MOG BH within a plasma environment, investigating how much the presence of plasma influences the characteristics of the observed shadow. Our analysis reveals that the shadow characteristics of M87* and Sgr A* are more compatible with event horizon telescope (EHT) observational data in nonhomogeneous plasma spacetime compared to homogeneous distributions.

## 13. Unified $χ^2$ discriminators for gravitational wave searches from   compact coalescing binaries

**Authors:** Sanjeev Dhurandhar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18051v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave (GW) signals of astrophysical origin are typically weak. In the search for coalescing compact binary (CBC) signals, short-duration non-Gaussian noise transients (glitches) in the detector data significantly affect the search sensitivity. We show that this structure paves the way for constructing effective discriminators against different morphologies of glitches. Here we specifically demonstrate our method on blip glitches, which can be modelled as sine-Gausians.

## 14. Hairless Black Hole by Superradiance

**Authors:** Sebastian Garcia-Saenz, Guangzhou Guo, Peng Wang, Xinmiao Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18003v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18003v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the interplaying effects of black hole scalarization and superradiance in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model. The combination of the two effects may thus be seen as a particularly efficient mechanism for the extraction of energy from a black hole. We accurately compute the amounts of energy transfer in different channels by deriving formulae for the energy fluxes of matter fields in the presence of a dynamical horizon, which are amenable for evaluation in numerical relativity calculations.

## 15. Avoiding singularities with propagating torsion

**Authors:** Luca Fabbri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17979v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17979v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the torsional completion of the theory of gravity. The torsion is a propagating axial- vector field interacting with spinor fields. We show how this changes the energy conditions leading to singularity formation being avoided. We conclude that the theory is correct and can be used to explain the origin of gravity's gravity waves and the formation of singularities in space and time. Back to Mail Online home.

## 16. Fastly spinning dark matter-admixed neutron stars

**Authors:** Lorenzo Cipriani, Edoardo Giangrandi, Violetta Sagun, Daniela D. Doneva, Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17948v1)

**Summary:**

Millisecond pulsars are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutronStars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron star. They also offer new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark Matter.

## 17. $f(Q)$ gravitational theory and its structure via red-shift

**Authors:** G. G. L. Nashed

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17937v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17937v1)

**Summary:**

We present a novel approach for reconstructing the $f(Q)$ gravitational theory. This method enables the development of modified gravity scenarios that align with cosmological observations. We analyze two deceleration parameter models and one effective equation of state model from the literature. By leveraging the matter density parameter's asymptotic behaviour, we further refine the viable parameter space for these models. One tested model demonstrates that even slight modifications can yield viable cosmic scenarios, where the dark energy (DE) sector becomes dynamic. These scenarios are qualitatively distinct yet quantitatively consistent with $\Lambda$CDM.

## 18. Cosmological constraints on two vacuum decay models

**Authors:** Yupeng Yang, Yicheng Wang, Xinyi Dai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17792v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17792v1)

**Summary:**

We constrain two vacuum decay models ($\Lambda(t)$CDM) using the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) We find that the decay parameter is constrained to be $Q=3\varepsilon H\rho_{\L Lambda}$ for model I. The current Hubble parameter values are estimated to be. $H_0$ suggesting that these two vacuum. decay models could provide a potential solution to alleviate the Hubble tension problem.
