## 0. Observing Hot Holographic Quark Star With Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Le-Feng Chen, Heng-Yi Yuan, Meng-Hua Zhou, Kun Lu, Jing-Yi Wu, Kilar Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17121v1)

**Summary:**

We extract the equation of state for hot quark matter from a holographic $2+1$ flavor QCD model. By adding a thin hadron shell, a new type of hybrid star is constructed. With the temperature serving as a parameter, the EoS varies. We obtain stable stars with the maximum mass of around 23 to 30 solar masses, and the compactness around $0.1$. These compact stars are candidates for black hole mimickers, which could be observed by gravitational waves.

## 1. Entanglement and squeezing of gravitational waves

**Authors:** Thiago Guerreiro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17043v1)

**Summary:**

The output of gravitational nonlinear processes can also be sensitive to quantum features of the input states. This offers a new direction for probing the quantum nature of gravity, analogous to how the quantumness of electrodynamics was established through quantum optics. Due to gauge and quantization issues in strongly curved spacetimes, we work in the geometric optics limit of gravitational radiation. But we expect the key ideas extend to situations of astrophysical interest, such as the formation of supermassive black holes.

## 2. Asymmetric dual cascade in gravitational wave turbulence

**Authors:** Benoît Gay, Sébastien Galtier

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17023v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17023v1)

**Summary:**

When a forcing is applied to an intermediate wavenumber $k_i$, we observe a dual cascade of energy and wave action. In decaying turbulence, the study reveals that the wave action spectrum can extend to wavenumbers greater than the initial excitation. We also observe a wave action decay in time in $t^{-1/3}$ while the front of the energy spectrum progresses. These properties can be understood with simple theoretical arguments. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

## 3. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)

**Authors:** Benoit Famaey, Amel Durakovic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17006v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17006v1)

**Summary:**

Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is the proposal that, below a certain acceleration scale $a_0$, dynamics departs from the Newtonian expectation. In that context, the determining factor for the emergence of apparent missing matter in galactic systems is predicted to be the acceleration, and not the mass or size of the system. MOND enables, for example, the prediction of rotation curves from only the baryonic distribution of galaxies. It is not a complete theory, but a phenomenological non-relativistic paradigm in the limit of low accelerations.

## 4. Dipolar perturbations of nonbidiagonal black holes in bigravity

**Authors:** David Brizuela, Marco de Cesare, Araceli Soler Oficial

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16984v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16984v1)

**Summary:**

In bimetric gravity, nonbidiagonal solutions describing a static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black hole are given by a pair of Schwarzschild geometries, one in each metric sector. We study the dynamics of axial dipolar perturbations on such a background and obtain general analytical solutions for their evolution. We show that, in general, the characteristic curves followed by dipolar gravitational waves are spacelike with respect to both metrics, and thus the propagation is superluminal.

## 5. Can the sound horizon-free measurement of $H_0$ constrain early new   physics?

**Authors:** Jun-Qian Jiang, Yun-Song Piao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16883v1)

**Summary:**

The sound horizon-independent $H_0$ extracted by using galaxy clustering surveys data through, e.g., EFTofLSS or ShapeFit analyses, is considered to have the potential to constrain the early new physics responsible for solving the Hubble tension. In this work, we clarify some potential misuses and misinterpretations in these analyses. We also make forecasts for an Euclid-like survey, which suggest that ongoing observations will also have difficulty ruling out early new Physics.

## 6. The thermal index of neutron-star matter in the virial approximation

**Authors:** Giuseppe Rivieccio, Adriana Nadal-Matosas, Arnau Rios, Milton Ruiz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16795v1)

**Summary:**

We use the virial expansion to account for nuclear interaction effects. When we incorporate protons, electrons and photons, we find that the density and temperature dependence of the thermal index changes significantly. We predict a smooth transition between an electron-dominated regime at low densities and a neutron-dominated region at high densities. We model this smooth transition analytically and provide a simple but accurate parametrization of the inflection point between these regimes. The virial approximation provides a clear and physically intuitive framework for understanding thermal properties of dense matter.

## 7. Statistical biases in parameterized searches for gravitational-wave   polarizations

**Authors:** Hayato Imafuku, Hiroki Takeda, Atsushi Nishizawa, Daiki Watarai, Kipp Cannon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16788v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16788v1)

**Summary:**

In tests of gravity using gravitational waves (GWs), GW events analyzed are often selected based on specific criteria, particularly the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Such event selection can introduce bias into parameter estimation unless the selection effect is appropriately taken into account in the analysis. In this paper, we investigate how event selection with certain prior information affects parameter inference within the scalar-tensor polarization framework. We find that for the Tensor+Scalar(dipole) model, the amplitude of the scalpar dipole radiation is overestimated when its true value is nonzero.

## 8. The Regular Ricci-Inverse Cosmology with Multiple Anticurvature Scalars

**Authors:** Yicen Mou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16628v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the modified gravity in which the Lagrangian of gravity is a function of the trace of the n-th matrix power of Ricci tensor in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker(FLRW) spacetime. When n is negative, the inverse, also called the anticurvature tensor, will be introduced. We design a new Ricci-inverse theory containing two anticurVature scalars and resulting to be free from the singularity problem.
