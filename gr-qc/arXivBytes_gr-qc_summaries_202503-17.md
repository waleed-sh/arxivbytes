## 0. Gravitational Redshift from Galaxy Clusters -- a Relativistic Approach

**Authors:** Enea Di Dio, Sveva Castello, Camille Bonvin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11585v1)

**Summary:**

The light that we receive from clusters of galaxies is redshifted by the presence of the clusters' gravitational potential. This effect, known as gravitational redshift, is an early prediction of Einstein occurring in any metric theory of gravity. In this work, we present the first derivation of all such effects within a relativistic framework, accurate to third order in the weak-field approximation. We compare our result with previous literature and show that some terms were not properly included, leading to an overestimation of kinematic contamination.

## 1. Superconvergent Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Scalar Teukolsky   Equation on Hyperboloidal Domains: Efficient Waveform and Self-Force   Computation

**Authors:** Manas Vishal, Scott E. Field, Sigal Gottlieb, Jennifer Ryan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11523v1)

**Summary:**

The long-time evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems requires minimal phase and dispersion errors to accurately compute far-field waveforms. Spectrally accurate methods, such as nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, are well suited for these tasks. We show that certain DG schemes exhibit superconvergence, where truncation, phase, and dispersive errors can decrease as fast as $N+1. This ensures that waveforms, total energy and angular-momentum fluxes, and self-force computations benefit from super Convergence.

## 2. Expanded atlas of the sky in continuous gravitational waves

**Authors:** Vladimir Dergachev, Maria Alessandra Papa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11512v1)

**Summary:**

We present the full release of the atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering frequencies from 20 Hz to 1700 Hz. Conducting continuous wave searches is computationally intensive and time-consuming. The atlas facilitates the execution of new searches with relatively minimal computing resources. Compared to the early atlas release, we have extended the frequency range and have performed follow-up on the outliers. We have also added spindowns from -5e-10 to 5e- 10 Hz/s.

## 3. First loosely coherent search for continuous gravitational wave sources   with substellar companions in the Orion spur

**Authors:** Vladimir Dergachev, Maria Alessandra Papa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11503v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11503v1)

**Summary:**

We report on the first loosely coherent search for binary systems. We searched 0.06 rad disk in the Orion spur, covering gravitational wave frequencies from 100 to 700 Hz. A follow-up was performed, which found no outliers. An atlas of results from the first stage of the search is made publicly available. The full report is available at: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/01/07/science-mag-magical-gravitational-wave-search-for-binary-systems.

## 4. Holographic Description of Bulk Wave Packets in AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$

**Authors:** Norihiro Tanahashi, Seiji Terashima, Shiki Yoshikawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11485v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we extend the study of wave packets from the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. We find that, while the energy still localizes on the light cone, its spatial distribution exhibits momentum dependence. This result is significant as it reflects leading $1/N$ corrections to the generalized free field theory associated with the free bulk theory at $N=\infty$. Our findings are consistent with previous studies on entanglement wedge reconstruction.

## 5. Probing fundamental physics using compact astrophysical objects

**Authors:** E. -A. Kolonia, C. J. A. P. Martins, Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11447v1)

**Summary:**

Alternative theories to the Standard Model allow -- and sometimes require -- fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant, to vary in spacetime. We demonstrate that one way to investigate these variations is through the Mass-Radius relation of compact astrophysical objects. We present some constraints on these models based on current data and outline how future observations might distinguish between extensions of the Standard model. We then extend our analysis to neutron stars, building upon the polytropic approach to consider more realistic equations of state.

## 6. Shadow formation in gravitational collapse: redshift and blueshift by   spacetime dynamics

**Authors:** Yasutaka Koga, Nobuyuki Asaka, Masashi Kimura, Kazumasa Okabayashi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11401v1)

**Summary:**

A black hole illuminated by a background light source is observed as a black hole shadow. Redshift of light due to the spacetime dynamics is expected to play a crucial role in the shadow formation. This result suggests that a shadow image is generally formed in the late stage of the gravitational collapse of a transmissive object. The redshift effect analyzed in this work is regarded as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect or the Rees-Sciama effect in gravitational collapse. It provides its intuitive interpretation with a Newtonian analogy.

## 7. On the phase transition mechanism of spontaneous scalarization

**Authors:** João Vitor M. Muniz, Raissa F. P. Mendes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11385v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11385v1)

**Summary:**

In certain modified gravity theories, compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars may undergo a process known as spontaneous scalarization. This is when the scalar field is suddenly activated beyond a certain critical point. Since its discovery, it has been clear that this effect can be understood in many cases as a continuous phase transition. In this paper, we take a closer look at the nature of spontaneous Scalarization as a phase transition, analyzing in detail cases where it occurs as either a second- or first-order transition.

## 8. Metastable Cosmological Constant and Gravitational Bubbles:   Ultra-Late-Time Transitions in Modified Gravity

**Authors:** Dimitrios Efstratiou, Leandros Perivolaropoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11365v1)

**Summary:**

The observed cosmological constant may originate as the minimum value $U_{min}$ of a scalar field potential. If this vacuum is metastable, it may decay to a true vacuum either at present or in the future. We find that the nucleation scale of gravitational constant bubbles remains consistent with the sub-millimeter regime of General Relativity. We discuss observational hints supporting these scenarios and the theoretical challenges they face. We review various local physics or/and transition based proposed solutions to the Hubble tension.

## 9. Spinor field in Bianchi type-I cosmology with Lyras geometry

**Authors:** Bijan Saha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11326v1)

**Summary:**

The study examined the role of a nonlinear spinor field in the evolution of the Universe. It was done in the framework of a Bianchi type-I cosmological model with Lyras geometry. The influence arises from the fact that the invariants of thespinor field are dependent on the Lyra geometry parameter. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Light and Space.

## 10. Growth of Cosmic Strings beyond Kination

**Authors:** Luca Brunelli, Michele Cicoli, Francisco G. Pedro

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11293v1)

**Summary:**

A novel mechanism for the production of a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. In this paper, we generalise the analysis of this growth mechanism by using dynamical system techniques. We find a cosmological growth for fundamental strings even without kination, as in scaling fixed points, and for EFT strings arising from D3- and NS5-branes wrapped around fibration cycles. We then apply this analysis to fundamental strings and EFTstrings obtained from wrapping $p$-brane on $(p-1)$-cycles.

## 11. Observed galaxy number counts on the lightcone up to third order

**Authors:** Lorenzo Gervani, Daniele Bertacca, Nicola Bartolo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11191v1)

**Summary:**

In this work we provide a detailed derivation of the observed galaxy number over-density obtained by computing cosmological perturbations up to third order in redshift space. We have considered all post- and post-post-Born contributions from the photon geodesic equations in order to take into account all possible effects due to the lensing distortions. This result will be important for a variety of applications, such as a complete estimation of projection effects and the investigation of possible parity violation signatures in the 3- and 4-point galaxy correlation functions.

## 12. Connecting Relativistic MOND Theories with Mimetic Gravity

**Authors:** Guillem Domènech, Alexander Ganz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11174v1)

**Summary:**

We find a connection between relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theories and (scalar) mimetic gravity. We first demonstrate that any MOND model featuring a unit-timelike vector field, such as TeVeS, can be embedded within a conformal/disformal-invariant framework. This perspective offers deeper insight into how non-invertible disformal transformations serve as fundamental principles in constructing viable alternatives to dark matter. Lastly, by constructing the fundamental building blocks of a scalar- vector-tensor theory, we establish a new framework for developing MOND theories.

## 13. Bumblebee gravity: spherically-symmetric solutions away from the   potential minimum

**Authors:** Quentin G. Bailey, Hailey S. Murray, Dario T. Walter-Cardona

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10998v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study a vector model of spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking coupled to gravity. The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source. Finally, we discuss observational constraints on these spacetimes using the resulting orbital behavior.
