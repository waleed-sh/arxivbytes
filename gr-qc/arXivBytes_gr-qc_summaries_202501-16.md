## 0. Bayesian analysis of analog gravity systems with the Rezzolla-Zhidenko   metric

**Authors:** Saulo Albuquerque, Sebastian H. Völkel

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09000v1)

**Summary:**

Analog gravity systems have the unique opportunity to probe theoretical aspects of black hole physics in a controlled laboratory environment. In this work, we address the question of whether one could use controlled initial perturbations to excite the black hole ringdown and infer the effective black hole metric. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible in principle and discuss opportunities beyond this study. In contrast to standard ringdown analyses based on quasi-normal mode extraction, a laboratory-controlled setup, in combination with our framework, allows one to model the entire signal.

## 1. Black Hole Tomography: Unveiling Black Hole Ringdown via Gravitational   Wave Observations

**Authors:** A. Ribes Metidieri, B. Bonga, B. Krishnan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08964v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08964v1)

**Summary:**

During the post-merger regime of a binary black hole merger, the gravitational wave signal consists of a superposition of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the remnant black hole. In this paper, we provide an analytic explanation for this observation in the perturbative regime. Our analysis is based on a characteristic initial value formulation where data is prescribed on the horizon and on a transversal null-hypersurface which registers the outgoing radiation. This allows us to reformulate the traditional QNM problem in a fully 4-dimensional setting.

## 2. Insights into Supermassive Black Hole Mergers from the Gravitational   Wave Background

**Authors:** C. M. F. Mingarelli, L. Blecha, T. Bogdanović, M. Charisi, S. Chen, A. Escala, B. Goncharov, M. J. Graham, S. Komossa, S. T. McWilliams, D. A. Schwartz, J. Zrake

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08956v1)

**Summary:**

 workshop explored discrepancies between experimental results and theoretical models for a background originating from supermassive black hole binary mergers. Underestimated theoretical and/or experimental uncertainties are likely to be the explanation. The most compelling detections would involve systems exhibiting both electromagnetic and gravitational wave signatures, according to the workshop's conclusion. The workshop was held at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Zurich, Switzerland, on November 14 and 15. For more information, visit www.kavliinstitute.org.

## 3. Revisiting the fermionic quasi-bound states around Schwarzschild black   holes with improved analytic spectrum

**Authors:** Guang-Shang Chen, Cheng-Bo Yang, Shou-Shan Bao, Yong Tang, Yue-Liang Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08881v1)

**Summary:**

The dynamics of a massive Dirac field outside a Schwarzschild black hole is revisited. The method yields a compact and unified analytical expression for the energy spectrum. The improvement is due to high-order correction of angular parameter that has been ignored previously, says the study. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal. It is based on a paper published by the Royal Astronomical Society in London, and is published by Elsevier on behalf of the Royal Academy of Sciences.

## 4. The Spectroscopy of Kerr-Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion: Exact   Quasibound States, Scalar Cloud, Horizon's Boson Statistics and Superradiance

**Authors:** David Senjaya, Supakchai Ponglertsakul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08788v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08788v1)

**Summary:**

In the present study, we investigate the quasibound states, scalar cloud and superradiance of relativistic scalar fields bound to a rotating black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory (Kerr-EMDA) We present the exact eigensolutions of the governing Klein-Gordon equation in the black hole background. We explore a boson distribution function by linearly expanding the radial wave function near the black Hole's event horizon.

## 5. Can Rotating Black Holes Have Short Hairs?

**Authors:** Rajes Ghosh, Chiranjeeb Singha

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08767v1)

**Summary:**

Hairy black hole (BH) solutions exist in both General Relativity and modified gravity theories. For such hairs to be detectable, they must extend sufficiently beyond the event horizon. This idea has been rigorously formalized by the no-short hair theorem. However, the theorem's applicability to the astrophysically relevant rotating BHs remains elusive as yet, say the authors of a new study. The study marks an important first step toward establishing general results on the extent of rotating Black Holes, they say.

## 6. Exploring the Viability of $f(Q, T)$ Gravity: Constraining Parameters   with Cosmological Observations

**Authors:** Rahul Bhagat, Santosh V. Lohakare, B. Mishra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08666v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we explore the model of $ f(Q, T) $ gravity, an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity. The model is developed as an alternative to the standard $Lambda$CDM cosmological model. We also examine cosmographic parameters, confirming the transition of the Universe from deceleration to acceleration. Additionally, the model provides age estimates for the Universe that are consistent with current observations. The results show that the model effectively mimics the standard model while offering an alternative explanation based on modified gravity.

## 7. Impact of particle production during inflation on the detection of CMB   B-mode polarization

**Authors:** Xunliang Yang, Zhe Yu, Zhoujian Cao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08592v1)

**Summary:**

This work focuses on particle production described by a nonminimally coupled model during inflation. In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs) We identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. We compare the total power spectrum with that of primordial GWs, revealing a characteristic peak in the total spectrum. This peak can be used to test the model and differentiate it from other inflationary sources.

## 8. Boundary conditions of general black hole perturbations

**Authors:** Wei Xiong, Peng-Cheng Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08557v1)

**Summary:**

The boundary conditions for a general perturbation at spatial infinity and the event horizon of a black hole (BH) are investigated. The results may provide valuable insights for the calculation of quasinormal modes and the gravitational waves generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, extending beyond the standard Kerr case. In particular, by extending the formulation introduced by Teukolsky and utilizing purely geometric principles, we derive a universal expression for the boundary condition at the horizon. This expression is elegantly formulated in terms of the physical quantities at theEvent horizon, specifically the surface gravity and angular velocity.
