## 0. Universal description of the Neutron Star's surface and its key global   properties: A Machine Learning Approach for nonrotating and rapidly rotating   stellar models

**Authors:** Grigorios Papigkiotis, Georgios Vardakas, Aristidis Likas, Nikolaos Stergioulas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18544v1)

**Summary:**

Neutron stars provide an ideal theoretical framework for exploring fundamental physics when nuclear matter surpasses densities encountered within atomic nuclei. Despite their paramount importance, uncertainties in the equation of state (EoS) have shrouded their internal structure. For rotating neutron stars, the shape of their surface is contingent upon the EoS and the rotational dynamics. This research addresses key astronomical aspects by utilizing these global parameters as features for the training phase of a neural network. The suggested relations could provide an accurate framework for the star's surface estimation using data acquired from the NICER X-ray telescope.

## 1. Non-singular bounce solutions in Myrzakulov $f(R,T)$ gravity

**Authors:** Andreas Lymperis, Gulgassyl Nugmanova, Almira Sergazina

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18524v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the realization of a nonsingular bounce within the framework of Myrzakulov gravity. This modified gravitational theory uses a non-special connection that combines both curvature and torsion. We examine the evolution of scalar perturbations through the bounce using the Mukhanov-Sasaki formalism, and we calculate the power spectrum. We suitably choose the functions that parametrize the connection in order to be able to produce simple and matter bounce scale factors at the background level.

## 2. Fractonic self-duality and covariant magnetic fractons

**Authors:** Erica Bertolini, Giandomenico Palumbo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18510v1)

**Summary:**

Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. We find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.

## 3. A healthier stochastic semiclassical gravity: world without   Schrödinger cats

**Authors:** Lajos Diósi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18486v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18486v1)

**Summary:**

Semiclassical gravity couples classical gravity to the quantized matter in meanfield approximation. The meanfield coupling is problematic for two reasons. First, it ignores the quantum fluctuation of matter distribution. Second, it violates the linearity of the quantum dynamics. Restoration of quantum linearity requires a conceptual approach to hybrid classical-quantum coupling. It is based on a postulated mechanism of spontaneous quantum monitoring plus feedback. This approach eliminates Schr\"{o}dinger cat states and takes quantum fluctuations into account.

## 4. DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in   gravitational wave data with deep learning

**Authors:** Tom Dooney, Harsh Narola, Stefano Bromuri, R. Lyana Curier, Chris Van Den Broeck, Sarah Caudill, Daniel Stanley Tan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18423v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18423v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave (GW) interferometers detect faint signals from distant astrophysical events, such as binary black hole mergers. However, their high sensitivity makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches" that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable scientific inference. We present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct signals with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source.

## 5. Avoiding Big Rip Singularities in Phantom Scalar Field theory with   Gauss-Bonnet term

**Authors:** Giannis Papagiannopoulos, Genly Leon, Andronikos Paliathanasis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18392v1)

**Summary:**

We consider a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar within a spatially flat FLRW geometry. We perform a detailed phase space analysis using two sets of dimensionless variables. This model supports inflationary solutions without the Big Rip or Big Crunch singularities appearing as asymptotic solutions. The result remains valid even in the absence of the interaction term. This outcome is attributed to the presence of the Gaussian scalar. The results are based on the Hubble normalization approach and the matter-scalar field normalization.

## 6. Holographic Correlators of Boundary/Crosscap CFTs in Two Dimensions

**Authors:** Yun-Ze Li, Yunfei Xie, Song He

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18386v1)

**Summary:**

This work explores holographic correlators within the frameworks of two-dimensional Boundary Conformal Field Theory. We compute stress tensor correlators in BCFT, considering both tensionless and tensionful end-of-the-world (EOW) brane scenarios. Extending these results, we investigate the holographic duals of XCFTs, presenting explicit scalar and stress Tensor correlator computations on projective geometries such as $\mathbb{RP}^2$.

## 7. Gravitational waves from metastable cosmic strings in the delayed   scaling scenario

**Authors:** Yifan Hu, Kohei Kamada

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18380v1)

**Summary:**

Recent observations suggest the presence of nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) Such signals could be explained by gravitational waves from a network of metastable cosmic strings. Standard scenarios involving the Kibble-Zurek mechanism triggered by a thermal potential face significant challenges. In contrast, a delayed scaling scenario, where the CSs start to emit GWs at a later time due to the dilution during inflation, alleviates these issues. This scenario allows for a larger string tension while monopoles are sufficiently diluted such that the CS network safely forms.

## 8. Gaussian-process reconstructions and model building of quintom dark   energy from latest cosmological observations

**Authors:** Yuhang Yang, Qingqing Wang, Chunyu Li, Peibo Yuan, Xin Ren, Emmanuel N. Saridakis, Yi-Fu Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18336v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18336v1)

**Summary:**

In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct thecosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations. We divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy. We show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.

## 9. Quintessential Implications of the presence of AdS in the Dark Energy   sector

**Authors:** Purba Mukherjee, Dharmendra Kumar, Anjan A Sen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18335v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18335v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the implications of incorporating an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua in the Dark Energy (DE) sector. We use DESI BAO measurements in combination with Planck-2018 CMB, Pantheon-Plus(+SH0ES) supernovae and KiDS weak lensing data. Our findings highlight the importance of the presence of AdS in the DE sector for theoretical model building, especially in the context of quantum gravity theories, e.g. string theory.

## 10. Cosmological quantum mechanics on FLRW spacetimes

**Authors:** Edwin Beggs, Shahn Majid

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18295v1)

**Summary:**

We apply our recent formulation of general relativistic quantum mechanics to the case of an FLRW cosmological background. The formalism comes from noncommutative geometry and provides an operator version of the equations of a geodesic. We also show how this is relevant to quantum mechanics on space with respect to time $t$, identifying potentially new physics when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.

## 11. Reconciling fractional entropy and black hole entropy compositions

**Authors:** Manosh T. Manoharan, N. Shaji

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18151v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates the implications of adopting fractional entropy in the area law framework and demonstrates its natural alignment with an isothermal description of black hole composition. We define an empirical temperature for the horizon. Unlike the Hawking temperature, this empirical temperature appears universal, and its proximity to the Planck temperature suggests a possible quantum gravity origin. Equilibrium distribution analysis uncovers multiple configurations, in which the one satisfying the prerequisites of probability distribution exhibits an exponent stretched form, revealing apparent deviation from the Boltzmann distribution.

## 12. Sudden Decoherence by Resonant Particle Excitation for Testing   Gravity-Induced Entanglement

**Authors:** Youka Kaku, Akira Matsumura, Tomohiro Fujita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18147v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18147v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel method to probe gravity-induced entanglement. We consider the gravitational interaction between a particle trapped in a shallow potential and a harmonic oscillator. Once the excited particle is detected, the quantum state of the oscillator is collapsed, which can be observed as the sudden disappearance of the superposition of oscillator frequencies. Since the probability of particle excitation increases linearly with time, the total probability is multiplied by repeating experiments. We will also discuss experimental implementations using optomechanics.

## 13. There is Room at the Top: Fundamental Quantum Limits for Detecting   Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Xinyao Guo, Haixing Miao, Zhi-Wei Wang, Huan Yang, Ye-Ling Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146v1)

**Summary:**

The sky of astrophysical gravitational waves is expected to be quiet above $\sim 10{\rm kHz}$, which is the upper limit of characteristic frequencies of dynamical processes involving astrophysical black holes and neutron stars. Ultra-high frequency GWs also provide a window to test topological defects such as domain walls and cosmic strings generated close to the GUT scale. We develop a universal framework for the quantum limit under different measurement schemes and input quantum states, and apply them to several plausible detector configurations. The fundamental limits are expressed as the strength of gravitational wave background at different frequencies.

## 14. Entropy Bounds and Holographic Dark Energy: Conflicts and Consensus

**Authors:** Manosh T. Manoharan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18144v1)

**Summary:**

We revisit the formulation of the CKN entropy bound and compare it with other bounds. The specific characteristics of each bound are shown to depend on the underlying scaling of entropy. Emphasising cosmological implications, we confirm the consistency between the bounds and the first laws of horizon thermodynamics. We then analyse the shortcomings in standard Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) models. Using the Hubble function in HDE definitions introduces circular logic, causing dark energy to mimic the second dominant component rather than behaving as matter.

## 15. Better early than never: A new test for superluminal gravitational wave   polarizations

**Authors:** Kristen Schumacher, Colm Talbot, Daniel E. Holz, Nicolás Yunes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18125v1)

**Summary:**

In some beyond-Einstein theories of gravity, gravitational waves can contain up to six polarizations. These different propagation speeds imply that polarizations generated by the same source will not arrive simultaneously at the detector. We propose a new technique to test for the existence of superluminal, non-transverse-traceless polarizations that arrive in the data before a gravitational-wave observation. We discuss the circumstances in which these non- Transverse-Traceless modes would be detectable and what constraints could be placed if they are not.

## 16. Gravitational waves decohere quantum superpositions

**Authors:** Flynn Linton, Shubhanshu Tiwari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18111v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study the decoherence of a quantum spatial superposition of a massive body created by an observer, Alice, that is subject to a short burst of gravitational radiation. We show that Alice's state decoheres proportional to the memory of the gravitational radiation she emits. This work serves as a step towards understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity by demonstrating the role gravitational waves and the memory effect have in the loss of coherence of quantum superpositions.
