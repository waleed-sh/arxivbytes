## 0. Transverse expansion of the metric at null hypersurfaces II. Existence   results and application to Killing horizons

**Authors:** Marc Mars, Gabriel Sánchez-Pérez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03983v1)

**Summary:**

This paper finishes the series of two papers that we started with [arXiv:2405.05377], where we analyzed the transverse expansion of the metric at a general null hypersurface. Here we show existence of ambient. manifolds given the full asymptotic expansion at the null. hypersurfaced. When such expansion fulfills a set of "constraint equations" we prove that the ambient. manifold solves the Einstein equations to infinite order at the hypersurfaces.

## 1. Quantum Scalar Field Dynamics On A Maximally Sliced Two-sided AdS Black   Hole Spacetime

**Authors:** Anurag Kaushal, Naveen S. Prabhakar, Spenta R. Wadia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03926v1)

**Summary:**

We study the semi-classical dynamics of a scalar field in the background of a black hole in an asymptotically AdS (AAdS) spacetime, in the framework of the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. We present the explicit solution for the smooth maximal slicing of the fully extended BTZ solution where the spatial slices cut across the horizons, do not include the past and future singularities, and for which the lapse remains non-zero at the bifurcate point. While many of our results are valid for AAdS$_{d+1}$ spacetimes, we mainly discuss the $d=2$ case of the static BTz solution.

## 2. Pulsar timing in the Galactic Center

**Authors:** Riccardo Della Monica, Ivan de Martino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03912v1)

**Summary:**

We demonstrate the inability of current timing codes based on the post-Newtonian expansion of General Relativity to correctly estimate the relativistic time of arrival of the emitted pulses at an Earth-based observatory. We also show how a misestimation of the pulsar parameters can lead to the appearance of phase-dependent residual, which hints at a tremendous constraining power of the binary and intrinsic parameters for timing observations of potential pulsars at the Galactic Center. We propose a novel approach which implements the calculations of the photon travel time into a robust timing model for pulsars orbiting supermassive black holes.

## 3. General spherically symmetric black bounces within non-linear   electrodynamics

**Authors:** G. Alencar, Albert Duran-Cabacés, Diego Rubiera-Garcia, Diego Sáez-Chillón Gómez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03909v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03909v1)

**Summary:**

The search of new regular black bounce solutions has drawn a lot of attention over the international community working in gravitation. The study of everywhere regular solutions has become a common trend given the unique opportunity posed by multi-messenger astronomy to test deviations from the Kerr family of solutions. We show that even after imposing some smoothness and flatness conditions on the metric components, additional analysis is required to obtain a well-defined black bounce solution. Then, the corresponding matter Lagrangian is reconstructed by using non-linear electrodynamics and the energy conditions are studied.

## 4. Signatures of a gravitational quantum vacuum on dynamics of massive   particles

**Authors:** Aaron R. Malcolm, Zhi-Wei Wang, B. Sharmila, Animesh Datta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03886v1)

**Summary:**

We study the interaction of two massive particles with a quantised gravitational field in its vacuum state using two different position observables. For free particles, (i) leads to purely unitary dynamics. For two particles coupled through a linear spring, ( i) and (ii) lead to different cut-off dependences in the frequency shift harmonic ladder of the differential motional mode. Our findings highlight the subtle consequences of different position Observables at the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity. We present our results in a paper published in the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 5. Bekenstein Bound for Approximately Local Charged States

**Authors:** Stefan Hollands, Roberto Longo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03849v1)

**Summary:**

We generalize the energy-entropy ratio inequality in quantum field theory (QFT) from localized states to a larger class of states. The states considered in this paper can be in a charged (non-vacuum) representation of the QFT or may be only approximately localized in the region under consideration. Our inequality is $S(\Psi |\!| \Omega) \le 2\pi R \, ( \Psi, H_\rho \ Psi ) + \log d(\rho) + \varepsilon$, where $S$ is the relative entropy.

## 6. Ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators for relativistic phenomena

**Authors:** Ralf Schützhold

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03785v1)

**Summary:**

The goal of this article is to review developments regarding the use of ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators. Special emphasis is placed on relativistic quantum phenomena, which are presumably most interesting for the audience of this journal. After that, the focus is shifted to phenomena of non-linear fields, such as the sine-Gordon model, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, false-vacuum decay, and quantum back-reaction. Even though effort is made to provide a review as fair as possible, there can be no claim of completeness and the selection of the topics may well reflect some personal bias.

## 7. Foliated Asymptotically Safe Gravity -- Lorentzian Signature   Fluctuations from the Wick Rotation

**Authors:** Frank Saueressig, Jian Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03752v1)

**Summary:**

Asymptotic Safety constitutes a promising mechanism for a consistent and predictive high-energy completion of the gravitational interactions. Most results on the interacting renormalization group fixed point underlying the construction are obtained for Euclidean signature spacetimes. We discuss the general conditions which guarantee the equivalence of the beta functions. These insights are illustrated based on the flow of the graviton two-point function within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. The UV- and IR-completions identified in the Euclideans case are robust when changing spacetime signature.

## 8. Strong Gravitational Lensing by Compact Object without Cauchy Horizons   in Effective Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** Suvankar Paul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03745v1)

**Summary:**

Study of strong gravitational lensing effects of a static, spherically symmetric solution in the context of effective quantum gravity. This solution gives rise to black hole as well as horizonless wormhole solutions depending on the range of values of the quantum parameter. It is shown that with increase of quantum parameter, time delay between the first two relativistic images increases. Since its value comes out to be of the order of several days, precision measurements of time delay may become important to specify parameters of background geometry.

## 9. Complexity and Isotropization based Extended Models in the context of   Electromagnetic Field: An Implication of Minimal Gravitational Decoupling

**Authors:** Tayyab Naseer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03690v1)

**Summary:**

This paper formulates three different analytical solutions to the gravitational field equations in the framework of Rastall theory. For this, the anisotropic spherical interior fluid distribution is assumed as a seed source characterized by the corresponding Lagrangian. The field equations are then modified by introducing an additional source which is gravitationally coupled with the former fluid setup. It is concluded that all resulting models show physically acceptable behavior under certain choices of RASTall and decoupling parameters. The estimated data of a pulsar $4U 1820-30$ is considered so that the feasibility of the developed models can be checked graphically.

## 10. $Λ$CDM Model Against Gravity-Thermodynamics Conjecture:   Observational Constraints After DESI 2024

**Authors:** N. Shahhoseini, M. Malekjani, A. Khodam-Mohammadi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03655v1)

**Summary:**

In the context of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture based on the Tsallis entropy-area relation, we investigate the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and examine some potential deviations from it. Utilizing recent updates from geometrical datasets, including the DESI BAO measurements (2024), Planck CMB anisotropy measurements (2018), and the Pantheon+ catalogue for SNIa (2022), we conduct a thorough analysis. We observe support for the standard model and consistency between our constraints on the Hubble constant and the Planck value.

## 11. Weak deflection angle of charged signal in magnetic fields

**Authors:** Qianchuan Wang, Junji Jia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03554v1)

**Summary:**

The deflection angle is expressed as a series expansion of the inverse of the impact parameter $b$, with coefficients determined by the asymptotic expansions of the metric functions and the electromagnetic four-potential. The entire electromagnetic part is enhanced by the large specific charge of elementary particles but suppressed by the reciprocal Lorentz factor. In all these cases, it is found that in the weak deflection limit, these effects agree with the expectation for a LorentZ force; that is, an attractive (or repulsive) one will enlarge (or decrease) the deflected angle.

## 12. Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible   for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?

**Authors:** Chan-Gyung Park, Bharat Ratra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480v1)

**Summary:**

We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$)

## 13. Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations

**Authors:** Mohammad Ali Gorji, Misao Sasaki, Teruaki Suyama

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03444v1)

**Summary:**

We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations. We also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exactTransfer function reproduces known behaviors.
