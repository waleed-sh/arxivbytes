**Summary:**

Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers are expected to produce kilonovae (KNe) Four NSBH candidates have been identified and followed-up by more than fifty instruments since the start of the fourth GW Observing Run (O4) However, no confirmed associated KN has been detected. This study evaluates ejecta properties from multi-messenger observations to understand the absence of detectable KN. We also analyze the trade-off between observation efficiency and the intrinsic properties of the KN emission.

## 1. Orbital eccentricity in a neutron star - black hole binary

**Authors:** Gonzalo Morras, Geraint Pratten, Patricia Schmidt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15393v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15393v1)

**Summary:**

The observation of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars provides a unique opportunity to discern information about their astrophysical environment. Two signatures that are considered powerful tracers to distinguish between different binary formation channels are general-relativistic spin-induced orbital precession and orbital eccentricity. To date, neither precession nor eccentricity have been discerned in neutron star - black hole binaries. Here we report the first measurement of orbital eccentricities in a neutron star-black hole binary.

## 2. Quantum Creation of a FRW Universe: applying the Riesz fractional   derivative

**Authors:** D. L. Canedo, P. Moniz, G. Oliveira-Neto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15348v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we apply fractional calculus to study quantum cosmology. We investigate numerically the tunnelling probability for the Universe to emerge using a suitable WKB approximation. Our findings are as follows. When we decrease the value for $1$ in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, the probability also decreases. This suggests that if fractional features could be considered to ascertain among different early universe scenarios, then the value $2$ (meaning strict locality and standard cosmology) would be the most likely.

## 3. QNMs of charged black holes in AdS spacetime: a geometrical optics   perspective

**Authors:** Shubham Kala, Anik Rudra, Hemwati Nandan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15257v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the quasinormal modes of the Reissner$-$Nordstr\"om anti$-$de Sitter black hole using the Penrose limit. Applying this limit to bound null orbits around black holes allows us to explore the black hole response to perturbations. Increasing charge enhances both the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies, while a decreasing cosmological constant leads to higher real frequencies. The spectrum stabilizes at larger values of the cosmologically constant. We analyze the effects of black hole charge and negative cosmology constant on the quatinormal spectrum.

## 4. Rotating scalarized black holes: the role of the coupling

**Authors:** Kalin V. Staykov, Daniela D. Doneva, Pedro G. S. Fernandes, Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15206v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15206v1)

**Summary:**

Even for very large spins, the scalar charge can reach values comparable to those in the static limit. Curvature-induced scalarization can lead to non-GR signatures of similar magnitude in both static and rapidly rotating cases. For certain coupling parameters, these scalarized black hole solutions remain within the regime of validity of the effective field theory, where the theory has well-posed formulations, the authors say. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Black Holes.

## 5. Photon Absorption in a Doubly Special Relativity Model with Undeformed   Free Propagation and Total Momentum Conservation

**Authors:** J. M. Carmona, J. L. Cortés, F. Rescic, M. A. Reyes, T. Terzić

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15203v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15203v1)

**Summary:**

The lack of a dynamical framework within doubly special relativity theories has impeded the development of a corresponding phenomenology of modified interactions. In this work we show that in a model based on the classical basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e and total momentum conservation, one has a well-defined cross section of the photon-photon annihilation process. The modification of the interaction can lead to observable effects in the opacity of the Universe to very high-energy gamma rays when the gamma-ray energy approaches the energy scale of the deformation.

## 6. Primordial correlators from multi-point propagators

**Authors:** Andrea Costantini, Laura Iacconi, David J. Mulryne

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15194v1)

**Summary:**

Numerical methods have been developed that overcome some of the difficulties arising in analytical calculations when the models considered are complex. The PyTransport package, which implements the transport formalism, allows computation of the tree-level 2- and 3-point correlation functions for multi-field models with arbitrary potentials and a curved field space. In this work we investigate an alternative numerical implementation of the transport approach, based on the use of transfer ''matrices'' called multi-point propagators (MPP)

## 7. Noncommutative Quasinormal Modes and the Violation of Isospectrality

**Authors:** Nikola Herceg, Tajron Jurić, A. Naveena Kumara, Andjelo Samsarov, Ivica Smolić

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15181v1)

**Summary:**

We explore quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Schwarzschild black hole under a noncommutative (NC) deformation of spacetime. Our results show that whereas the commutative case preserves the isospectrality of axial and polar modes,Noncommutativity systematically violates this degeneracy. The discrepancy grows with the strength of the NC parameter, becoming evident through distinct real and imaginary parts in the ringdown frequencies. These findings highlight the potential of black hole QNMs to serve as probes of quantum-spacetime corrections in strong-field regimes.

## 8. Covariant effective spacetimes of spherically symmetric electro-vacuum   with a cosmological constant

**Authors:** Jinsong Yang, Cong Zhang, Yongge Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15157v1)

**Summary:**

This paper extends the framework to the electro-vacuum case with a cosmological constant. We propose an effective Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic field. The resulting model is covariant with respect to both the effective metric and the effective vector potential. Some of these solutions reveal quantum gravity effects manifesting not only in spacetime metrics but also in the electromagneticField. Finally, the covariance of coupling models with general matter fields is discussed. The paper was published in the journal Theoretical Physics.

## 9. Gregory-Laflamme-type instability of boson strings and related phases in   D=5 Kaluza-Klein theory

**Authors:** Carlos A. R. Herdeiro, Eugen Radu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15069v1)

**Summary:**

We add an $S^1$ extra dimension (size $L$) to the well known $D=4$ static, spherically symmetric $Q$-balls and boson stars. We show that the resulting uniform horizonless boson strings possess a static zero-mode for a critical value of $L$. This is at the threshold of a Gregory-Laflamme instability of these objects. The non-linear continuation of the zero- mode yields $D =5$ non-uniform bosonstrings.

## 10. Orbits of photon in Bardeen-boson stars and their frozen states

**Authors:** Long-Xing Huang, Shi-Xian Sun, Yu-Peng Zhang, Zhen-Hua Zhao, Yong-Qiang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14984v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14984v1)

**Summary:**

The Bardeen-boson star (BBS) model involves a scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity and a Bardeen's nonlinear electromagnetic field. All BBSs do not have the event horizon and possess complete null geodesics, allowing photons to move throughout the entire spacetime of BBS. The null orbits around the FBBSs exhibit sharp deflections near the critical horizon while becoming nearly straight inside thecritical horizon. Furthermore, the photon in the background ofFBBSs moves for a very long time inside the critical Horizon from the perspective of an infinity viewer.

## 11. Constraining Axially Symmetric Bianchi Type I Model with Self-Consistent   Recombination History and Observables

**Authors:** Boris Hoi-Lun Ng, Ming-Chung Chu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14969v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14969v1)

**Summary:**

Recent cosmological measurements suggest the possibility of an anisotropic universe. The Bianchi Type I model has been extensively studied. We show how the recombination history should be modified in such a universe. We obtain a tight constraint on the anisotropy that generally agrees with previous studies under a maximum temperature an isotropy fraction of $2\times 10^{-5}$. We stress that there is a significant difference between the geodesic-based observables and the naive isotropic analogies.

## 12. Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology

**Authors:** John Joseph Carrasco, Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde, Diederik Roest

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904v1)

**Summary:**

Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions. The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. The potential in theAxion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation. The axion field remains nearly massless.
