## 0. On the Holographic Dual of a Symmetry Operator at Finite Temperature

**Authors:** Jonathan J. Heckman, Max Hübner, Chitraang Murdia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16427v1)

**Summary:**

Topological symmetry operators of holographic large $N$ CFT$_D$'s are dual to dynamical branes in the gravity dual AdS$_{D+1}$. We use this correspondence to establish a dictionary between thermal expectation values of symmetry operators in the Euclidean CFT $_D$, and the evaluation of gravitational saddles. We illustrate with some representative examples, including gravity in AdS $_3$, duality / triality defects in 4D Super Yang-Mills theory, and the dual of R-symmetry operators probing 5D BPS black holes.

## 1. Apparent $w<-1$ and a Lower $S_8$ from Dark Axion and Dark Baryons   Interactions

**Authors:** Justin Khoury, Meng-Xiang Lin, Mark Trodden

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16415v1)

**Summary:**

Dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea.

## 2. Primodial power spectrum in loop quantum cosmology for different   regularizations

**Authors:** Maciej Kowalczyk, Guillermo A. Mena Marugán, Tomasz Pawłowski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16377v1)

**Summary:**

In Loop Quantum Cosmology, the quantization of the Hamiltonian constraint involves a regularization procedure which is affected by certain ambiguities. Different regularizations lead to distinct mathematical formulations and, consequently, to different physical predictions. In this work, we explore the impact of this regularization on the primordial power spectrum of cosmological perturbations. We compare the results and prove that the main relevant distinction between the corresponding spectra is the scale where power suppression occurs. The associated wavenumber scale is proportional to the square root of the critical density.

## 3. Natural inflation in Palatini $F(R,X)$

**Authors:** N. Bostan, R. H. Dejrah, C. Dioguardi, A. Racioppi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16324v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we study the case of a Jordan frame potential which is positive and bounded, specifically, natural inflation. We compute the CMB observables and show that for a wide class of $F(R,X)$ theories, including the quadratic one, naturalflation is still viable. We conclude that natural inflation is viable for a range of theories including Palatini gravity. The paper was published in the journal Physical Review Letters on November 14, 2013.

## 4. Proto-neutron star oscillations including accretion flows

**Authors:** Dimitra Tseneklidou, Raimon Luna, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, Alejandro Torres-Forné

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16317v1)

**Summary:**

The gravitational wave signature from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is dominated by quadrupolar oscillation modes of the newly born proto-neutron star (PNS) This could be detectable at galactic distances. We have developed a framework for computing the normal oscillations modes of a PNS in general relativity. For the first time, we have shown the presence of an accretion flow and a surrounding stalled accretion shock. These new ingredients are key to understand PNS oscillations.

## 5. The First Model-Independent Chromatic Microlensing Search: No Evidence   in the Gravitational Wave Catalog of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA

**Authors:** Aniruddha Chakraborty, Suvodip Mukherjee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16281v1)

**Summary:**

The lensing of Gravitational Waves (GWs) due to intervening matter distribution in the universe can lead to chromatic and achromatic signatures. This makes it difficult to model for the unknown mass distribution of the lens. We perform the first model-independent microlensing search in the wave-optics limit on the 80 GW events observed with both the LIGO detectors. With this, we confidently rule out the presence of any statistically significant microlensed signal in the 80 events of GWTC-3.

## 6. Thermodynamics of sign-switching dark energy models

**Authors:** David Tamayo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16272v1)

**Summary:**

We perform a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of three sign-switching dark energy models in a flat FLRW cosmology. We systematically derive key cosmological thermodynamic quantities using the Generalised Second Law (GSL) as the fundamental evaluation criterion. We highlight a key insight: models with divergences in the product of the dark energy equation-of-state and its energy density inevitably produce thermodynamic inconsistencies. This thermodynamic approach provides a complementary criterion alongside observational constraints for evaluating the physical viability ofcosmological models.

## 7. Spherically symmetric horizonless solutions and their frozen states in   Bardeen spacetime with Proca field

**Authors:** Rong Zhang, Yong-Qiang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16265v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we construct a static spherical symmetric Bardeen-Proca star (BPS) model. The introduction of the Proca field disrupts the formation of event horizons, ensuring that these solutions are globally regular throughout the spacetime. We find that when the magnetic charge is sufficiently large, solutions with a critical horizon emerge as $\omega \rightarrow 0$. For the light ring, we find that the light rings always appear in pairs, located on both sides of the critical horizon. For timelike circular orbits, we investigate their distribution in the Spacetime of BPSs.

## 8. Superluminal Dark Photons as a Solution to the GRB 221009A Anomaly

**Authors:** Antonios Valamontes, Emmanuel Markoulakis, Ioannis Adamopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16253v1)

**Summary:**

The detection of exceptionally high-energy {\gamma}-photons from GRB 221009A by the LHAASO Collaboration challenges conventional physics. Photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillations have been proposed to explain this anomaly. We present an alternative explanation involving superluminal dark photons. We propose that dark photons facilitated faster-than-light (FTL) propagation of information. This hypothesis aligns with cosmological observations and experimental results, including those from the LHC.

## 9. Stability of Positive Mass Theorem for Static Quasi-Local Energy of   Compact (Locally) Hyperbolic Graphical Manifolds

**Authors:** Aghil Alaee, Jiusen Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16246v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16246v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we consider compact graphical manifolds with boundary over (locally) hyperbolic static space. We prove the stability of the positive mass theorem with respect to the Federer--Fleming flat distance for the static quasi-local Brown-York energy of the outer boundary of compact ( Locally)Hyperbolic graphical Manifolds. The paper is published by the American Mathematical Society at the request of the editor-in-chief of the journal Mathematical Theory.

## 10. Probing classical and quantum violations of the equivalence of active   and passive gravitational mass

**Authors:** Vasileios Fragkos, Igor Pikovski

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16198v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16198v1)

**Summary:**

The equivalence of active and passive (EAP) gravitational mass is one of the most fundamental principles of gravity. Here we revisit this principle and show how it can be used to probe quantum gravity in laboratory-based experiments. We show that experiments with cold polar molecules, and future experiments with nuclear atomic clocks, can test the quantum EAP in a regime where quantum gravity phenomenology could become relevant. Our results open new opportunities for fundamental tests of gravity in high-precision laboratory experiments.

## 11. The entropy of dynamical de Sitter horizons

**Authors:** Jinan Zhao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16138v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical cosmological event horizon. The formula is valid to leading order for perturbations of a stationary asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. We generalize Gibbons and Hawking's first law of event horizons to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non- stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmologically event horizon, and introduce a nontrivial correction term.

## 12. Testing f (R) gravity models with DESI-BAO and other cosmological data

**Authors:** Francisco Plaza, Lucila Kraiselburd

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16132v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16132v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we conduct a statistical analysis of various cosmological models within the framework of f (R) gravity theories. Special attention is given to the incorporation of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Our results show an increase in the values of the distortion parameter b and of the Hubble parameter H0 estimates, due to the use of this new compilation of SnIa data. However, no major changes are perceived when using the DESI data set instead of the previous BAO observations.

## 13. Long-lived Quasinormal Modes and Gray-Body Factors of black holes and   wormholes in dark matter inspired Weyl Gravity

**Authors:** B. C. Lütfüoğlu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16087v1)

**Summary:**

We calculate quasinormal modes and gray-body factors of a massive scalar field in the background of three compact objects in the Weyl gravity. We show that the spectrum of the massive field is qualitatively different from massless one both in the frequency and time domains. While the mass term leads to much longer lifetime of the modes, the arbitrarily long-lived modes, known as quasi-resonances, are not achieved. The study was published in the journal Phys.Rev.D 110 (2024) 12, 124006.

## 14. The transition to phenomenological behaviour of static solutions of the   Einstein-Dirac system for an increasing number of fermions

**Authors:** Håkan Andréasson, Joakim Blomquist

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15995v1)

**Summary:**

 Static spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Dirac system were constructed numerically for the first time in 1999 by Finster, Smoller and Yau. In 2020 this result was generalized by Leith, Hooley, Horne and Dritschel to a system consisting of an even number of fermions. It turns out that even for a comparatively small number of particles, the features of the solutions are remarkably similar. This supports the interpretation we make as a transition from quantum to classical behaviour as the number offermions increases.

## 15. Small-scale metric structure and horizons: Probing the nature of gravity

**Authors:** Alessandro Pesci

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15992v1)

**Summary:**

A recently developed tool allows for a description of spacetime as a manifold with a Lorentz-invariant (lower) limit length built-in. This is accomplished in terms of geometric quantities depending on two spacetime events (bitensors) and looking at the 2-point function of fields on it. What one gets is a metric bitensor with components singular in the coincidence limit of the two events. We discuss here how this metric structure encompasses also the case of null separated events, and describe some results one obtains with the null qmetric.

## 16. Copenhagen Survey on Black Holes and Fundamental Physics

**Authors:** Alice Y. Chen, Phil Halper, Niayesh Afshordi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15776v1)

**Summary:**

A total of 85 completed surveys were returned out of 151 registered participants of the "Black holes Inside and out" conference, held in Copenhagen in 2024. The survey asked questions about the nature of black holes and some of the most contentious issues in fundamental physics. The only statement that gains majority approval (by 68% of participants) was that the Big Bang means that "the universe evolved from a hot dense state" This provides reasons for caution in describing ideas as consensus in the scientific community when a more nuanced view may be justified.

## 17. Search for continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars in five   globular clusters with a phase-tracking hidden Markov model in the third LIGO   observing run

**Authors:** L. Dunn, A. Melatos, P. Clearwater, S. Suvorova, L. Sun, W. Moran, R. J. Evans

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15773v1)

**Summary:**

A search is performed for continuous gravitational waves emitted by unknown neutron stars in five nearby globular clusters. The search uses a hidden Markov model to track both the frequency and phase of the continuous wave signal from one coherent segment to the next. After applying vetoes to reject candidates consistent with non-Gaussian artifacts, no significant candidates are detected. It represents the first time that a phase-tracking hidden MarkOV model has been used in a LIGO search. The best strain sensitivity is achieved for the cluster NGC6544.
