## 0. Wave-particle duality of gravitational radiation

**Authors:** Hudson A. Loughlin, Germain Tobar, Evan D. Hall, Vivishek Sudhir

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03527v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03527v1)

**Summary:**

The detector employed determines whether the gravitational field exhibits wave or particle characteristics. A linear detector, such as a homodyne detector, yields no signal for a field in a Fock state. Such a linear detector thus supports a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton, resulting in a quantum jump in energy equal to the energy of the absorbed graviton.

## 1. Generalized entropic dark energy with spatial curvature

**Authors:** Sergei D. Odintsov, Simone D'Onofrio, Tanmoy Paul

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03470v1)

**Summary:**

We construct a dark energy (DE) model from 4-parameter generalized entropy of apparent horizon in a spatially non-flat universe. The scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $Lambda$CDM model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of the present Hubble parameter leading to a possible resolution of the Hubble tension issue. This in turn leads to a positive spatial curvature of the the universe.

## 2. Reconciling the Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in   Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS Black Holes

**Authors:** Mohammad Reza Alipour, Saeed Noori Gashti, Behnam Pourhassan, İzzet Sakallı

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03453v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03453v1)

**Summary:**

The potential conflict between the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures (WCCC) poses a significant challenge in general relativity. This study investigates the reconciliation of the WGC and the WCCC by examining Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes in four-dimensional spacetime. The electromagnetic self-interaction parameter ($\mu) plays a crucial role in achieving this compatibility, says the study. It examines parameter spaces that satisfy both conjectures, ensuring event horizons and photon spheres while maintaining black hole properties.

## 3. Entanglement and local holography in quantum gravity

**Authors:** Gabriel Wong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03452v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03452v1)

**Summary:**

The It from Qubit paradigm proposes that gravitational spacetimes emerge from quantum entanglement. We argue that string theory provides the mechanism to define these entangled qubits in the bulk gravitating theory. This involves a local form of geometric transition, which is the stringy mechanism that underlies \emph{local} holography. We illustrate how this works in the A model topological string, and show how it works in a topologicalstring model, as well as in a non-topological string.

## 4. Probing Gauged $U(1)$ Sub-GeV Dark Matter via Cosmic Ray Cooling in   Active Galactic Nuclei

**Authors:** Arvind Kumar Mishra, Ning Liu, Chih-Ting Lu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03409v1)

**Summary:**

 Cosmic rays (CRs) traversing the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be cooled through interactions with DM particles. In this study, we investigated constraints on sub-GeV DM particles charged under various $U(1)$ gauge symmetries by exploiting the cooling effect of CRs in AGNs. We find that for low DM and mediator masses, the CR cooling rate is higher compared to the standard model cooling process. We explore the bounds on the DM-electron and DM-proton elastic scattering cross-sections.

## 5. Probing loop quantum effects through solar system experiments:   observational signatures and parameter constraints

**Authors:** Wen-Juan Ai, Ruo-Ting Chen, Jian-Pin Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03218v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03218v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity. The tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantumgravity effects. The study was published in the journal of The Astrophysics of Quantum Gravity (ASG) and is available on the ASG website.
