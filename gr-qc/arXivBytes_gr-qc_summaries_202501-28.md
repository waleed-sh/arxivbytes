## 0. Efficient evaluation of real-time path integrals

**Authors:** Job Feldbrugge, Joshua Y. L. Jones

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16323v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16323v1)

**Summary:**

The Feynman path integral has revolutionized modern approaches to quantum physics. The direct evaluation of real-time path integrals is still extremely expensive and numerically delicate due to its high-dimensional and oscillatory nature. We propose an efficient method for the numerical evaluation of the real- time world-line path integral for theories where the potential is dominated by a quadratic at infinity. Our method directly applies to problems in quantum mechanics, the word-line quantization of quantum field theory, and quantum gravity.

## 1. Positivity and Entanglement in Markovian Open Quantum Systems and Hybrid   Classical-Quantum Theories of Gravity

**Authors:** Oliviero Angeli, Matteo Carlesso

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16253v1)

**Summary:**

Markovian master equations underlie many areas of modern physics. Despite their simplicity, they encode a rich and complex dynamics which is still under active research. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. In particular, by focusing on the Di\'osi-Penrose model for two gravitationally interacting masses, we show that entangling-based experiments would constrain the free parameter of the model $R_0$ up to values six orders of magnitude stronger than the current state of the art.

## 2. Time-resolved and Superradiantly Amplified Unruh Signal

**Authors:** Akhil Deswal, Navdeep Arya, Kinjalk Lochan, Sandeep K. Goyal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16219v1)

**Summary:**

An atom serves as a natural probe of quantum field fluctuations and any modifications to them, as fundamentally manifested in spontaneous emission. A collection of excited atoms can spontaneously develop correlations seeded by the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The correlations build over a finite time period, culminating in an intense, directional emission of photons known as superradiance. The early superradiant burst thus emerges as an unambiguous signature of the Unruh effect. The field fluctuations perceived inertially under the sub-resonant cavity configuration would cause a superradian burst much later.

## 3. Testing the universality of quantum gravity theories with cosmic   messengers in the context of DSR theories

**Authors:** Marco Danilo Claudio Torri

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16141v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16141v1)

**Summary:**

New mathematical tools are required to preserve covariance of the formulation even if in an amended formulation. We consider DSR theories that modify covariance by introducing a non-trivial structure in momentum space. Several astroparticle phenomena are then analyzed to test the phenomenological predictions of DSR models. We explore the possibility of investigating both universal quantum gravity corrections and scenarios where different particle species are corrected differently within the framework of these models. The results of this work are published in the open-access issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

## 4. Quasinormal Ringing and Shadows of Black Holes and Wormholes in Dark   Matter-Inspired Weyl Gravity

**Authors:** R. A. Konoplya, A. Khrabustovskyi, Jan Kříž, A. Zhidenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16134v1)

**Summary:**

Weyl gravity naturally generates effective dark matter and cosmological constant terms as integration constants. The framework permits three intriguing solutions for compact objects: an asymptotically de Sitter Schwarzschild-like black hole described by the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, a non-Schwarzschild black hole, and a traversable wormhole that exists without exotic matter. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal spectra of all three solutions. We also compute shadow radii for black holes and wormholes within Weyl gravity.

## 5. Acceleration as refrigeration: Acceleration-induced spontaneous symmetry   breaking in thermal medium

**Authors:** Maxim N. Chernodub

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16129v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that a uniform acceleration of matter produces an effect similar to cooling, thus leading, in particular, to the enhancement effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We derive a simple dependence of the critical temperature of a second-order phase transition on acceleration that, as we argue, should be applicable to a broad range of field theories. We consider an example of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a co-accelerating reference frame and show that the acceleration of hot gas of interacting fermions enhances the mass gap generation.

## 6. PRINCESS: Prediction of compact binaries observations with gravitational   waves

**Authors:** Carole Périgois

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16127v1)

**Summary:**

PRINCESS combines predictions of both individual gravitational wave events and the associated astrophysical background. The tool aims to constrain models of stellar formation and compact object evolution. We detail the code structure, installation, and usage, providing examples of predictions for different astrophysical models and detector configurations. We also discuss ongoing developments to expand PRINCESS's capabilities, including accounting for additional sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and incorporating more advanced detector models. The paper also discusses the potential of future networks to resolve nearly all CBC events.

## 7. Properties of 4D spinfoam quantum geometry: Results from next-to-leading   order spinfoam large-$j$ asymptotics of 1-5 Pachner move

**Authors:** Haida Li, Muxin Han, Hongguang Liu, Shicong Song, Dongxue Qu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16094v1)

**Summary:**

This paper proposes several criteria to probe the non-trivialities of 4-dimensional geometry that impact spinfoam amplitude. These criteria include the standard deviation of. 4-volumes of the constituting 4-simplices, the smallest 4-Simplex volume, and. whether the directions of tetrahedron 4-normals are close to the null direction. By numerically computing and analyzing the spinfoAm amplitudes up to the next-to-leading order of 1-5 Pachner move samples, we reveal the relationship between 4- dimensional geometry and spinfoAM amplitudes.

## 8. Propagation of massless particles around a BTZ-ModMax black hole

**Authors:** Shubham Kala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15999v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the deflection of light around a BTZ-ModMax black hole, focusing on the influence of the ModMax parameter and the cosmological constant. The trajectories of massless particles are explored through an analysis of null geodesics, providing deeper insights into the gravitational lensing effects in this modified black hole geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we derive thedeflection angle of light and provide a detailed examination of how the modMax and cosmologically constant impact the bending of light.

## 9. Rotating and non-linear magnetic-charged black hole with an anisotropic   matter field

**Authors:** Qi-Quan Li, Yu Zhang, Hoernisa Iminniyaz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15983v1)

**Summary:**

The event horizon and ergosphere of the rotating black hole are studied in terms of the perspective of geometric properties. The first law of thermodynamics and the squared-mass formula are derived from a thermodynamic perspective, based on which we obtain the thermodynamic quantities. We calculate the Penrose process for the rotatingblackhole, indicating the influence of various black hole parameters on the maximal efficiency of thePenrose process. We present the solution of a non-linear magnetic-charged black hole with an anisotropic matter field and further extend it to obtain the corresponding rotating black Hole solution.

## 10. Using Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy to simultaneously   alleviate the $H_{0}$ and $σ_{8}$ tensions

**Authors:** Stylianos A. Tsilioukas, Maria Petronikolou, Spyros Basilakos, Emmanuel N. Saridakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927v1)

**Summary:**

We present how Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy can alleviate $H_{0}$ and $sigma 8$ tensions simultaneously. This modified cosmological scenario is obtained by applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture to the Universe apparent horizon. We show that for particular regions of the parameter space the scenario at hand does lead to higher $H 0$ values. We verify this result performing a confrontation with observational data from Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC)

## 11. Observables for the Effect of Gravity on Electromagnetic Polarization

**Authors:** Kjell Tangen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15846v1)

**Summary:**

Polarization wiggling is sourced by curvature twist, which is a scalar derived from the Riemann tensor. Curvature twist is closely related to the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor, the second Weyl scalar as well as the rotation of the rest frame geodesic congruence. The results of this paper are valid for any metric theory of gravity and can be applied to any 4-dimensional spacetime and radiation with arbitrary state of polarization.

## 12. Recent Developments in Stochastic Inflation

**Authors:** R. P. Woodard

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15843v1)

**Summary:**

This article is dedicated to the memory of Alexei Starobinsky. I begin with some recollections of him and then review the generalization of his wonderful stochastic formalism. This entails effective potentials generated by the usual field-dependent masses, as well as by field- dependent field strengths. I also discuss secular loop corrections which cannot be captured by stochastically techniques. I conclude with a discussion of nonlinear sigma models and gravity.

## 13. Stationary scalar clouds around a rotating BTZ-like black hole in the   Einstein-bumblebee gravity

**Authors:** Fangli Quan, Fengjiao Li, Qiyuan Pan, Mengjie Wang, Jiliang Jing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15759v1)

**Summary:**

We have studied stationary clouds of massive scalar fields around a rotating BTZ-like black hole in the Einstein-bumblebee gravity, by imposing the Robin type boundary conditions at the AdS boundary. We establish, by scanning the parameter space, the existence of \textit{fundamental} stationary scalar clouds ($i.e. the overtone number $n=0$). In particular, we observe that the Lorentz symmetry breaking. parameter $s$ and the quantum number $k$ play an opposite role in determining scalar. clouds.

## 14. Higher order analysis of the gravitational wave velocity memory effect   between two free-falling gyroscopes in the plane wave spacetime

**Authors:** Yingxin Chen, Ke Wang, Chao-Jun Feng

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15745v1)

**Summary:**

In the plane wave spacetime, when gravitational waves pass by, an angular deviation exists between two free-falling gyroscopes, which naturally corresponds to the velocity memory effect. Under certain circumstances, the second-order contribution of the initial separation distance is of the same order of magnitude as the first- order contribution. When both + polarization and \(\times\) polarization are taken into account, in the context of the merger of supermassive black holes and with initial separation velocity approaching the speed of light, the order of magnitudes of the angle is 10-16 rads.

## 15. Dynamical system analysis of Bianchi III Universe with   $\boldsymbol{f(R,T)}$ gravity theory

**Authors:** Pranjal Sarmah, Umananda Dev Goswami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15715v1)

**Summary:**

Bianchi type III (BIII) metric is an interesting anisotropic model to study cosmic anisotropy. It has an additional exponential term multiplied by a directional scale factor and recasts the cosmological model as a dynamical system. All three models agree with the heteroclinically connected path of radiation, matter, and dark energy dominated phases of the Universe as predicted by standard cosmology. However, some $f(R,T)$ models may not be suitable for studying the evolution of the universe.
