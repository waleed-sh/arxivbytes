**Authors:** Fabian Lange, Johann Usovitsch, Zihao Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20197v1)

**Summary:**

Kira is a Feynman integral reduction program for high-precision calculations in quantum field theory and gravitational-wave physics. Kira 3 introduces optimized seeding and equation selection algorithms, significantly improving performance for multi-loop and multi-scale problems. New features include convenient numerical sampling, symbolic integration-by-parts reductions, and support for user-defined additional relations. We demonstrate its capabilities through benchmarks on two- and three-loop topologies, showcasing up to two orders of magnitude improvement over Kira 2.3.

## 1. Black hole thermodynamics and topology

**Authors:** G. E. Volovik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20194v1)

**Summary:**

The temperature of the de Sitter state is twice as high as that of the Gibbons-Hawking state. This difference is determined by the Euler characteristic of spacetime with Euclidean time. Here we consider the application of the topological approach to Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes with two horizons. Both the outer and inner horizons are characterized by their near-horizon topology, which determines the corresponding horizon temperatures. As a result of the correlation between the horizons, the entropy of the RN black hole is independent of its electric charge.

## 2. On the Possibility of the Existence of Wormholes in Nature

**Authors:** Leonel Bixano, Tonatiuh Matos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20167v1)

**Summary:**

Many exotic predictions of Einstein's equations have been corroborated, with one exception: wormholes. In this work, we analyze an exact solution to the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton or Phantom equations representing rotating WHs. We show that this WH is traversable through the poles, where tidal forces and the magnetic field are reasonably small. We argue that if dilaton-like interactions can exist in nature, for example, if extra dimensions exist as in superstring theory, WHs are a natural realistic prediction.

## 3. Shadows and Observational Images of a Schwarzschild-like Black Hole   Surrounded by a Dehnen-type Dark Matter Halo

**Authors:** Zuting Luo, Meirong Tang, Zhaoyi Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20115v1)

**Summary:**

This study investigates the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. The findings indicate that as the density of the DM halo and radius of the BH increase, the peak of the received intensity shifts toward a higher impact parameter $b$, resulting in a distinct optical appearance. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Light and Space (ASL) and is open-access.

## 4. Notes on Rindler wave packets in Minkowski spacetime

**Authors:** Shono Shibuya, Sotaro Sugishita

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20078v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20078v1)

**Summary:**

We consider wave packets of a massless scalar field that have well-localized Rindler energy. We examine how their energy appears to a Minkowski observer to see how the classical gravitational blue-shift formula is modified quantum mechanically. We derive, by using the saddle point approximation, an analytic expression for the Minksowski momentum distribution. We find a universal lower bound on the uncertainty of Minkswowski momentum. The momentum distribution can never become arbitrarily sharp, we conclude.

## 5. Area-charge inequality and local rigidity in charged initial data sets

**Authors:** Abraão Mendes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20060v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20060v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the geometric consequences of equality in area-charge inequalities for spherical minimal surfaces and marginally outer trapped surfaces. We show that, under appropriate energy and curvature conditions, saturation of the inequality imposes a rigid geometric structure in a neighborhood of the surface. In particular, the electric and magnetic fields must be normal to the foliation, and the local geometry is isometric to a Riemannian product. We establish two main rigidity theorems: one in the time-symmetric case and another for initial data sets that are not necessarily time-Symmetric.

## 6. Dynamical Formation of Charged Wormholes

**Authors:** Yasutaka Koga, Ryota Maeda, Daiki Saito, Keiya Uemichi, Daisuke Yoshida

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20040v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20040v1)

**Summary:**

We construct static, spherically symmetric, charged traversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell equations. Our solution contains a traversable throat, where the areal radius takes a minimum. In our formation scenario, the spacetime evolves sequentially from a black hole to Vaidya regions and finally to a wormhole, with each transition mediated by an impulsive null shell. We find that the radius of the wormhole throat is determined by the initial mass, spin of the initial black hole and the energy of the shell.

## 7. Static Black Hole Solution with a Dark Matter Halo

**Authors:** Uktamjon Uktamov, Sanjar Shaymatov, Bobomurat Ahmedov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20031v1)

**Summary:**

This solution could represent an alternative perspective on the interaction of black hole-dark matter systems. We study the properties of the newly derived BH solution by examining its spacetime curvature characteristics and energy conditions. This solution could provide new insights into the fundamental properties of DM halos. We present a novel analytical Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) solution that exhibits a static BH with a dark matter (DM) halo characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile.

## 8. Light propagation in the 2PN approximation in the monopole and   quadrupole field of a body at rest: Supplement

**Authors:** Sven Zschocke

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19963v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19963v1)

**Summary:**

In a recent investigation [1], the propagation of a light signal in the gravitational field of a body at rest has been determined in the second post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation. In order to integrate the geodesic equations for the light rays, the individual terms have been separated into time-dependent scalar functions and time-independent tensorial coefficients. For subsequent investigations it is more appropriate, to rearrange these tensorial terms into a new form. This rearranged form of the solution will be represented in this investigation.

## 9. Estimating the binary neutron star merger rate density evolution with   Einstein Telescope

**Authors:** Neha Singh, Tomasz Bulik, Aleksandra Olejak

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19962v1)

**Summary:**

The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a proposed third-generation, wide-band gravitational wave (GW) detector. It will have an improved detection sensitivity in low frequencies, leading to a longer observation time in the detection band. Despite the fact that ET will have a higher detection rate, a large fraction of BNSs will remain undetectable. We present a scheme to estimate accurate detection efficiency and to reconstruct the true merger rate density of the population of the B NSs, as a function of redshift.

## 10. Ultra-Planckian Quark and Gluon Scattering in Agravity

**Authors:** I. F. Cunha, A. C. Lehum

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19957v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks and gluons mediated by graviton exchange. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV- complete extension of general relativity.

## 11. Probing dipolar power asymmetry with galaxy clustering and intrinsic   alignments

**Authors:** Keita Minato, Atsushi Taruya, Teppei Okumura, Maresuke Shiraishi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19941v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19941v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the prospects for probing large-scale statistical anisotropy through galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments (IA) in Stage IV galaxy surveys. While IA alone provides limited improvement, the cross-spectrum between galaxy density and IA can contribute up to half the constraining power. This demonstrates the potential of IA-clustering cross-correlations as a robust consistency check against systematics. We also show that marginalizing over galaxy bias and IA bias parameters has a negligible impact on the final constraint on the an isotropy amplitude.

## 12. A pipeline for searching and fitting instrumental glitches in LISA data

**Authors:** Martina Muratore, Jonathan Gair, Olaf Hartwig, Michael L. Katz, Alexandre Toubiana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19870v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19870v1)

**Summary:**

Methodology employs advanced Bayesian techniques, including Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo and parallel tempering. The robustness of the pipeline is demonstrated through its ability to simultaneously handle diverse glitch morphologies and it is validated with a 'Spritz'-type data set from the LISA Data Challenge. Our approach enables accurate inference on Massive Black Hole Binaries, while simultaneously characterizing both instrumental artefacts and noise. These results present a significant development in strategies for differentiating between instrumental noise and astrophysical signals, which will ultimately improve the accuracy and reliability of source population analyses with LISA.

**Authors:** Ligong Bian, Rong-Gen Cai, Yu-Qi Dong, Qing Gao, Yungui Gong, Zong-Kuan Guo, Qing-Guo Huang, Zhaofeng Kang, Li Li, Jing Liu, Lang Liu, Yu-Xiao Liu, Xuchen Lu, Zhi-Zhang Peng, Jin Qiao, Puxun Wu, Yue-Liang Wu, Jiang-Hao Yu, Chen Yuan, Chao Zhang, Tao Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19747v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves (GWs) originating from cosmological sources offer direct insights into the physics of the primordial Universe, the fundamental nature of gravity, and the cosmic expansion of the Universe. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive overview of our recent advances in GW cosmology, supported by the national key research and development program of China. We then analyze how GWs are affected by large-scale structure,cosmological perturbations, and possible modifications of gravity on GW propagation.

## 14. Generic effective source for gravitational self-force calculations in   Schwarzschild spacetime

**Authors:** Chao Zhang, Rong-gen Cai, Guoyang Fu, Yungui Gong, Xuchen Lu, Wenting Zhou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19732v1)

**Summary:**

The numerical calculation of gravitational self-force in extreme mass ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs) is fundamentally challenging due to the singular nature of point-particle sources. This paper presents an analytic framework for constructing finite and continuous effective sources for massive point particles undergoing arbitrary geodesic motion in Schwarzschild spacetime. The complete analytic expression for effective sources establishes a critical foundation for computing both self-consistent and second-order gravitationalSelf-forces, thereby enabling accurate waveform modeling of EMRIs in gravitational wave astronomy.

**Authors:** Hajime Kobayashi, Shinji Mukohyama, Naritaka Oshita, Kazufumi Takahashi, Vicharit Yingcharoenrat

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19725v1)

**Summary:**

A set of tidal dissipation numbers (TDNs) quantifies the absorption of the tidal force exerted by a companion during an inspiralling phase of a binary compact object. We develop a parametrized formalism for calculating the TDNs of static and spherically symmetric BH backgrounds using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method. Our formalism applies to any system where the master equation has the form of the Regge-Wheeler/Zerilli equation with a small correction to the effective potential.

## 16. Alternative Derivations of Hawking Radiation

**Authors:** Chon Man Sou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19691v1)

**Summary:**

This chapter presents some alternative derivations of Hawking radiation in the literature. From these methods, various features of the black hole system can be seen. These features include the gravitational and trace anomalies of the $(1+1)$-dimensional effective theory and the analytical continuation of the complexified spacetime. This chapter provides various points of view of this effect in the intersection of gravity and quantum theory. It also discusses the tunneling, anomaly and Green's function methods. The book is published by Oxford University Press.

## 17. Greybody factors as robust gravitational observables: insights into   post-merger signals and echoes from ultracompact object

**Authors:** Romeo Felice Rosato

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19651v1)

**Summary:**

The quasinormal mode spectrum plays a central role in modeling the post-merger ringdown phase of binary coalescences of compact objects. However, its interpretation is subject to certain ambiguities. We investigate the robustness of greybody factors as gravitational observables, offering a complementary perspective to quasinorm mode analysis. We show that grey body factors are stable under small perturbations and are not affected by the specific ambiguisms that limit the reliability of quasin formal modes.

## 18. Krein space quantization and New Quantum Algorithms

**Authors:** M. V. Takook

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19632v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19632v1)

**Summary:**

Krein space quantization and ambient space formalism have been successfully applied to address challenges in quantum geometry. We aim to extend these methods to develop novel quantum algorithms for quantum computation. This approach represents a significant step beyond commonly used techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Decomposition and Sz.-Nagy dilation. The proposed algorithm has the potential to establish a unified framework for quantum algorithms, the authors say. It could be used to solve problems in quantum gravity and quantum Yang-Mills theory.

## 19. Quantum parameter-mass induced scalarization of qOS-black hole in the   Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory

**Authors:** Yun Soo Myung

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19450v1)

**Summary:**

We obtain quantum parameter ($\alpha$)-mass ($M$) induced spontaneous scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the unknown qOS action. We derive Smarr formula which describes a correct thermodynamics for the bald qOS-black hole. This work is considered as the first example to show a close connection between thermodynamics of bald black hole and spontaneous scalerization.

## 20. Highly-accurate neutron star modeling in the Hartle-Thorne Approximation

**Authors:** Carlos Conde-Ocazionez, Tuojin Yin, Jaquelyn Noronha-Hostler, Nicolás Yunes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19400v1)

**Summary:**

Future X-ray missions, such as NICER and LOFT, will provide new insights into neutron stars. Interpreting accurate observations in the future will require accurate models of their gravitational fields. In this first paper of a two-part series, we construct the perturbation equations for slowly-rotating, isolated, and unmagnetized neutron stars, extending the Hartle-Thorne approximation to seventh order in a slow-rotation expansion. We obtain exact, closed-form, analytical solutions for the exterior metric at each order in spin.
