## 0. Mind the gap: addressing data gaps and assessing noise mismodeling in   LISA

**Authors:** Ollie Burke, Sylvain Marsat, Jonathan R. Gair, Michael L. Katz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17426v1)

**Summary:**

Data gaps arising from instrumental irregularities and/or scheduled maintenance are unavoidable. Focusing on merger-dominated massive black hole binary signals, we test the appropriateness of the Whittle-likelihood on gapped data. Cheap-to-evaluate proxies to p-p plots are derived based on a Fisher-based formalism, and verified through Bayesian techniques. We demonstrate that the introduction of a tapering window reduces statistical inconsistency errors, at the cost of less precise parameter estimates. The theoretical and numerical practices that are presented in this work could readily be incorporated into global-fit pipelines.

## 1. Mapping Parameter Correlations in Spinning Binary Black Hole Mergers

**Authors:** Karen Kang, Simona J. Miller, Katerina Chatziioannou, Deborah Ferguson

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17402v1)

**Summary:**

The spins of black holes in binaries measured with gravitational waves provide insights about the formation, evolution, and dynamics of these systems. The imprint of spin in the inspiral, where the black holes are well-separated, is understood through analytic equations for the binary dynamics. Waveform-based correlation mapping can motivate effective spin parameters and reveal the imprint of spins on signals for which no simple analytic descriptions exist, the authors say. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 2. Measuring anisotropies in the PTA band with cross-correlations

**Authors:** Giulia Cusin, Cyril Pitrou, Martin Pijnenburg, Alberto Sesana

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17401v1)

**Summary:**

Cross-correlating a gravitational wave background map with a sufficiently dense galaxy survey can mitigate this issue. This approach could potentially reveal underlying properties of the gravitationalwave background that would otherwise remain obscured. It could lead to a first detection of the background anisotropy by a gravitationalwave observatory operating in the nHz frequency range, provided it has sufficient sensitivity. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Gravitational Wave Background (ASW) (http://www.astrophysics-of-gravitational-wave-background.com/ASW/2013/01/27/ASWA/2013-01-27-ASW.html).

## 3. Accounting for the Known Unkown: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate   Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation

**Authors:** Sumit Kumar, Max Melching, Frank Ohme

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17400v1)

**Summary:**

The Parameter Estimation (PE) for Gravitational Waves (GW) merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. This work presents a framework for accounting for uncertainties in waveform modeling. By injecting a series of precessing waveform models and using the nonspinning model for recovery, we show that our method can account for the missing physics by making the posterior samples broad enough to account for bias. We also present a Python package that is easily integrated with the publicly available GW analysis tool PyCBC.

## 4. Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and   Recent Observational Results

**Authors:** Marco Antonio Cardoso Alvarez, Leila Graef, Robert Brandenberger

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17395v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17395v1)

**Summary:**

Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmologists constant. The recent DESI data, which supports the possibility of dynamical dark energy, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work, we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of superHubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model.

## 5. Evaluation of physical properties of Kiselev like AdS spacetime in the   context of $f(R,~T)$ gravity under the impact of quantum gravity

**Authors:** Riasat Ali, Xia Tiecheng, Rimsha Babar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17342v1)

**Summary:**

The developments of the $f(R,~T)$ gravity theory inspire us to examine this theory in greater detail. In this study, we employ the semi-classical Hamilton-Jacobi procedure to investigate the Hawking temperature for 4-dimensional Kiselev-like AdS BHs. We derive the temperature using a standard formula for AdS black holes in the context of $f (R) gravity. The relativistic field equation is used to tunnel boson particles into the horizon under the effect of quantum gravity.

## 6. Global monopole in a Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity

**Authors:** F. M. Belchior, R. V. Maluf, A. Yu. Petrov, P. J. Porfírio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267v1)

**Summary:**

Black hole solutions in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR) bumblebee gravity sourced by a global monopole. This modified theory of gravity possesses the notable feature of incorporating local Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. Next, we study the impact of theglobal monopole and LSB corrections on two classical tests, namely, the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the light deflection. Ultimately, we estimate an upper bound for $\eta$ by comparing the theoretical results provided by the EKR model with observational data.

## 7. Gray-body factors: Method matters

**Authors:** Alexandre Arbey, Marco Calzà, Yuber F. Perez-Gonzalez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17240v1)

**Summary:**

The Chandrasekhar formalism is effective for static black holes. It faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. An alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. For a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the ChandraseKhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. We assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black hole.

## 8. Late-Time Saturation of Black Hole Complexity

**Authors:** Friðrik Freyr Gautason, Vyshnav Mohan, Lárus Thorlacius

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17179v1)

**Summary:**

The holographic complexity of a static spherically symmetric black hole grows linearly with time at late times in general relativity. The growth comes from a region at a constant transverse area inside the black hole and continues forever in the classical theory. In this region the volume complexity of any spheric black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions reduces to a geodesic length in an effective two-dimensional JT-gravity theory. The length has been argued to saturate at very late times via non-perturbative corrections.

## 9. Gauge Invariant Effective Potential

**Authors:** Debanjan Balui, Joydeep Chakrabortty, Debmalya Dey, Subhendra Mohanty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17156v1)

**Summary:**

We show that the long-standing problem of gauge dependence of the effective potential arises due to the factorisation of the determinant of operators. We show by correcting for this assumption by computing the multiplicative anomaly, the gauge-dependent terms of theeffective potential cancel. We also show that in two- and odd-dimensional non-compact spacetime manifolds, the standard calculation of one-loop effective potential gives a gauge-independent result. We advocate the Heat-Kernel expansion as the most straightforward method, as it naturally deals with the matrix elliptic operator.

## 10. A Multipole-Based Framework for Kerr Black Hole Mimickers: From General   Construction to a Specific Case of Study

**Authors:** Claudio Gambino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17032v1)

**Summary:**

We present a novel framework for constructing solutions to the Einstein equations with an arbitrary multipolar structure. We provide a systematic method to identify physically reasonable energy-momentum tensors that source black hole mimickers. As an example, we investigate an anisotropic fluid with a gaussian-like energy-density profile that, at linearized level, satisfies all energy and causality conditions. We obtain a fully non-perturbative solution that describes either a horizonless Schwarzschild mimicker or a static regular black hole model with a resolved curvature singularity.

## 11. General Einstein-Cartan quadratic gravity with derivative couplings

**Authors:** Theodoros Katsoulas, Kyriakos Tamvakis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16980v1)

**Summary:**

Within the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity we consider an action, containing up to quadratic terms of the Ricci scalar and the Holst invariant. We derive the equivalent metric theory, featuring an extra dynamical pseudoscalar degree of freedom. We study the evolution of the resulting two-field system in a FRW background and show that it evolves rapidly into an effective single-field inflationary model. We find that the model is consistent with the latest observational data for a wide range of its parameters.

## 12. Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational   collapse in asymptotically safe gravity

**Authors:** Tomohiro Harada, Chiang-Mei Chen, Rituparna Mandal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787v1)

**Summary:**

We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity. We investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid. We successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black hole. The resulting regular blackhole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric.

## 13. A duality of Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces inside and outside the horizon

**Authors:** Wu-zhong Guo, Jin Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16774v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16774v1)

**Summary:**

We study the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces associated with timelike subregions in static spacetimes with a horizon. These RT surfaces can extend into the horizon, allowing us to probe the interior of the black hole. We demonstrate that the area of the RT surface inside the horizon can be reconstructed from the contributions of RT surfaces outside the horizon. This result provides a concrete realization of black hole complementarity, where the information from the black Hole interior can be reconstructed from the degrees of freedom outside it.
