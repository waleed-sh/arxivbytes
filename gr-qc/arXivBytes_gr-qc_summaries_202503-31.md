## 0. Diffraction around caustics in gravitational wave lensing

**Authors:** Jose María Ezquiaga, Rico K. L. Lo, Luka Vujeva

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22648v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22648v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational lensing magnification is maximal around caustics. At these source locations, an incoming wave from a point source would formally experience an infinite amplification in the high-frequency or geometric optics limit. This divergence reflects the break-down of the mathematical formalism, which is regularized by either the finite size of the source or its wavelength. We find that the lensing distortions could be detectable, but that the stationary phase approximation is still a good description of the system even close to the caustic.

## 1. Shadow and gravitational lensing produced by the nonlinear accretion of   a scalar field onto a black hole

**Authors:** J. C. Acevedo-Muñoz, F. D. Lora-Clavijo, A. Cruz-Osorio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22624v1)

**Summary:**

The hypothesis that classical scalar fields could constitute dark matter on galactic and cosmic scales has garnered significant interest. In scenarios where supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form through the accretion of matter onto black hole seeds, a critical question arises: what role does dark matter play in this process? We conduct a numerical investigation into the nonlinear dynamical evolution of black hole shadows and gravitational lensing effects. Our results demonstrate significant growth in the apparent horizon, photon ring, and Einstein ring sizes compared to those of a Schwarzschild black hole.

## 2. Quantum Entropy-Driven Modifications to Holographic Dark Energy in   $f(G,T)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22609v1)

**Summary:**

We present a $f(G,T)$ gravity-based reconstruction of Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) This approach extends the conventional HDE model by replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with Barrow entropy. We explore the dynamics of a flat FRW background filled with a pressureless dust fluid. In the case of conserved energy-momentum tensor, our findings indicate that the BHDE model evolves from a quintessence-like regime into the phantom domain.

## 3. To CPL, or not to CPL? What we have not learned about the dark energy   equation of state

**Authors:** Savvas Nesseris, Yashar Akrami, Glenn D. Starkman

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22529v1)

**Summary:**

Using a Taylor expansion for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter adds extra information not present in the data. Fixing the higher-order terms to zero, one concludes that vacuum energy that is currently non-dynamical (e.g., the cosmological constant) is excluded as the explanation of cosmic acceleration. Instead marginalizing over the higher order terms shows that we know neither the current dark energy equations of state nor its current rate of change well enough to make such a claim. The results of analyses using simple Taylor expansions should be interpreted with great care.

## 4. NEC violation and "beyond Horndeski'' physics in light of DESI DR2

**Authors:** Gen Ye, Yong Cai

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22515v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22515v1)

**Summary:**

Recent DESI DR2 results provide compelling evidence that the dark energy equation of state evolves from $w<-1$ at high redshift to $w>-1 $ today. While NEC violation may be crucial for dark energy and solving the cosmological singularity problem, it generically leads to ghost or gradient instabilities. This finding suggests an unexpected possible connection between the primordial Universe and the late observable Universe. It is well established in the study of nonsingular cosmology that the effective field theory (EFT) operator enables fully stable NEC violation.

## 5. Generalized parameter-space metrics for continuous gravitational-wave   searches

**Authors:** P. B. Covas, R. Prix

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22504v1)

**Summary:**

 Parameter-space metrics are used to predict the relative loss of signal power when the searched parameters differ from the true signal parameters. In this paper we present generalized metrics for the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic. We also derive a more accurate semi-coherent metric that properly accounts for the signal-power variability over segments. More accurate metrics can result in a reduced number of templates needed for a given search, a feature that could improve the sensitivity of future searches for gravitational waves.

## 6. Volume in the Extensive Thermodynamics of Black Holes

**Authors:** Réka Somogyfoki, Péter Ván

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22482v1)

**Summary:**

There is no volume in classical black hole thermodynamics. Extensivity of such systems can be restored by introducing a new thermodynamic state variable, typically the volume, the mass or the number of particles. restored extensivity leads to a volume which corresponds to geometric concepts and is also meaningful from a physical point of view. The article examines various volume definitions in the context of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes and their implications for phase transitions, focusing on the Hawking-Page transition in Kerr-AdS spacetime.

## 7. Asymptotically safe canonical quantum gravity: Gaussian dust matter

**Authors:** Renata Ferrero, Thomas Thiemann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22474v1)

**Summary:**

In the present contribution we consider gravity coupled to Gaussian dust matter. This is a generally covariant Lorentzian signature system. The field theory version correctly accounts for geometry -- matter backreaction and thus in principle serves as a dark matter model. The intuitive geometric interpretation selects a preferred reference frame that allows to disentangle gauge degrees of freedom from observables. The CQG treatment of this theory has already been considered in the past. For this particular matter content it is possible to formulate the quantum field theory of observables as a non-linear $\sigma$ model.

## 8. Thermodynamics and Multi-Horizon Solutions in Quartic Quasitopological   Gravity: A Power-Maxwell Approach

**Authors:** A. Bazrafshan, M. Ghanaatian, P. Mirsalari, Gh. Forozani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22428v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we derive exact black hole solutions within the framework of fourth-order quasitopological gravity (4QTG) coupled to power-law Maxwell electrodynamics in five-dimensional spacetimes. We explore the thermodynamic properties of these solutions, including entropy, temperature, and electric potential, and verify the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. The study highlights the unique role of higher-curvature terms in modifying black hole thermodynamics and horizon structures, providing new insights into the interplay between geometry, thermodynamics, and quantum gravity.

## 9. Axial perturbations of black holes with primary scalar hair

**Authors:** Christos Charmousis, Simon Iteanu, David Langlois, Karim Noui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22348v1)

**Summary:**

We study axial perturbations of static black holes with primary hair in a family of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. These solutions possess a scalar charge, fully independent of the mass, leading to a continuous one-parameter deformation of the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Using a WKB approximation, we compute the quasi-normal modes for the Schr\"odinger-like equation associated with the effective metric outside the gravitational horizon.

## 10. Auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of corotating hotspots   in accretion disks

**Authors:** Qing-Hua Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22343v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22343v1)

**Summary:**

Recent horizon-scale observations of the Sgr A* might open up a new window to study spacetime geometry and accretion matter in the strong-field regime of gravity. variable emissions near the galactic center are expected in the observations. The fixed points for cross-correlations between lower-order images depend on the orbital configurations of hotspots. It challenges the use of correlations for lower- order images to infer black hole geometries. Although the emission shape can significantly influence light curves, it does not change the correlated bands of the correlations.

## 11. Influence of dark photon on magnetized and charged particle orbits   around static spherically symmetric black hole

**Authors:** Marek Rogatko, Paritosh Verma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22254v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22254v1)

**Summary:**

We elaborate the problem of magnetized particle motion in the spacetime of a static, spherically symmetric black hole influenced by weak magnetic fields stemming from visible and dark matter sectors. The Wald's procedure for obtaining the weakly magnetized solution, generalized to the case of dark photon - Einstein-Maxwell gravity was implemented. The collision process analysis of two particles in the background of the black hole has been studied in order to find the signature of dark matter presence in the nearby of the object in question.

## 12. Relatively non-degenerate integrated decay estimates on subextremal Kerr   de Sitter

**Authors:** Georgios Mavrogiannis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22090v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22090v1)

**Summary:**

We study the Klein--Gordon equation on subextremal Kerr de Sitter black hole backgrounds. We prove a "relatively non degenerate integrated" decay estimate assuming an appropriate mode stability statement for real frequency solutions of Carter's radial ode. We introduce a novel pseudodifferential commutation operator that generalizes our previous purely physical space commutation and we use it in conjunction with the Morawetz estimate of our companion \cite{mavrogiannis4}. This operator is defined using Fourier decomposition with respect to time frequencies $\omega$ and azimuthal frequencies $m.

## 13. Boundedness and Morawetz estimates on subextremal Kerr de Sitter

**Authors:** Georgios Mavrogiannis

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22077v1)

**Summary:**

We study the Klein--Gordon equation on subextremal Kerr--de Sitter black hole backgrounds. We prove boundedness and Morawetz estimates assuming an appropriate mode stability statement for real frequency solutions of Carter's radial ode. Our results in particular apply in the very slowly rotating case $|a|\ll M,l$, and in the case where the solution~$\psi$ is axisymmetric. This generalizes the work of Dafermos--Rodnianski on Schwarzschild--de~Sitter.
