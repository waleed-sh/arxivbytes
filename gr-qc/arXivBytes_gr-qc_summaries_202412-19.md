## 0. Revisiting the Immirzi parameter: Landauer's principle and alternative   entropy frameworks in Loop Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** Jorge Ananias Neto, Ronaldo Thibes

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14156v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the implications from area quantization in Loop Quantum Gravity. It focuses on the application of the Landauer principle. The principle establishes a connection between information theory and thermodynamics. The analysis also yields a new expression for the Immirzi parameter consistent with a corresponding modified Kaniadakis entropy for black hole entropy. It further illustrates the applicability of Landauer's principle in alternative statistical contexts within black hole physics. The paper was published in the Journal of Quantum Theory and Theory.

## 1. Alleviating cosmological tensions with a hybrid dark sector

**Authors:** Elsa M. Teixeira, Gaspard Poulot, Carsten van de Bruck, Eleonora Di Valentino, Vivian Poulin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14139v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate a cosmological model inspired by hybrid inflation. Two scalar fields representing dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interact through a coupling. Using CMB data, DESI BAO measurements and Pantheon+ supernova observations, we find that the model allows for an increase in $H_0$ that can help reduce the Hubble tension. We find that higher values of the coupling parameter are correlated with lower values of $\omega_m$ and a mild decrease of the weak-lensing parameter $S_8.

## 2. Gravitational lensing in a plasma from worldlines

**Authors:** Francesco Comberiati, Leonardo de la Cruz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14126v1)

**Summary:**

We study the deflection of light rays in a cold, non-magnetized plasma using the worldline framework. Starting from Synge's Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a position-space action and use it perturbatively to calculate light bending angles. In the homogeneous case, the action reduces to that of a massive particle, allowing us to extract the bending angle of light in the presence of the medium using a well-known analogy. We consider a power law model and construct Feynman rules in time to compute the purely plasma-induced corrections to thebending angle at Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO)

## 3. Path integral measure and RG equations for gravity

**Authors:** C. Branchina, V. Branchina, F. Contino, A. Pernace

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14108v1)

**Summary:**

We find that there is no sign of the non-trivial UV-attractive fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario. Crucial to our analysis is a careful treatment of the measure in the path integral that defines the running action and a proper introduction of the physical running scale $k$. We also show why and how in usual implementations of the RG equations the aforementioned UV- attractive fixedpoint is generated. We conclude by showing that the Einstein-Hilbert truncation of the renormalization group equations for the cosmological and Newton constant is not a problem.

## 4. Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation

**Authors:** Guillermo Ballesteros, Jesús Gambín Egea, Thomas Konstandin, Alejandro Pérez Rodríguez, Mathias Pierre, Julián Rey

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106v1)

**Summary:**

We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra-slow- roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.

## 5. Is the formation of primordial black holes from single-field inflation   compatible with standard cosmology?

**Authors:** Sasha Allegrini, Loris Del Grosso, Antonio J. Iovino, Alfredo Urbano

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14049v1)

**Summary:**

Single-field inflation models require more than fine-tuning a potential to induce ultra-slow roll. It necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the post-inflationary cosmological evolution. We introduce a new model, based on a double inflection point and consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background observations, capable of generating sub-solar PBHs. Their merger could be potentially detectable by the LVK experiment. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 6. Combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients of the causal set   d'Alembertian

**Authors:** Karen Yeats

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14036v1)

**Summary:**

The causal set theory d'Alembertian has rational coefficients for which alternating expressions are known. Here, a combinatorial interpretation of these numbers is given. For example, the coefficients of the causal set can be written as: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,

## 7. Real observers solving imaginary problems

**Authors:** Juan Maldacena

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14014v1)

**Summary:**

The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity computations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. The one loop gravity correction contains a dimension depenent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$, which seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including an observer, this phase gets cancelled for the quantity that should correspond to a count ofStates. We also show that this phase factor gets cancelled after adding an observer to the gravity correction.

## 8. Astrometry meets Pulsar Timing Arrays: Synergies for Gravitational Wave   Detection

**Authors:** N. M. Jiménez Cruz, Ameek Malhotra, Gianmassimo Tasinato, Ivonne Zavala

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14010v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14010v1)

**Summary:**

High-precision astrometry offers a promising approach to detect low-frequency gravitational waves, complementing pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We explore the response of astrometric measurements to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in synergy with PTA data. In the future, such joint constraints could play a crucial role in identifying the origin of SGWB signals detected by PTAs. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for the SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude.

## 9. Model-Agnostic Cosmological Inference with SDSS-IV eBOSS: Simultaneous   Probing for Background and Perturbed Universe

**Authors:** Purba Mukherjee, Anjan A. Sen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13973v1)

**Summary:**

We reconstruct the baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) observables as functions of redshift, using measurements from SDSS alone. We apply the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework to model the interdependencies of cosmological observables and track their evolution across different redshifts. Ours is a template for model-independent extraction of information for both background and perturbed Universe using a single galaxy survey.

## 10. Gravitational wave astronomy and the expansion history of the Universe

**Authors:** Massimo Giovannini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13968v1)

**Summary:**

The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. It is argued that during the next score year the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current paradigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole post-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum sensing. The multiparticle final state of the relics and its macroscopic quantumness is also discussed.

## 11. Euclidean teleparallel relativity and black hole partition functions

**Authors:** Jose Beltrán Jiménez, Tomi S. Koivisto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13946v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13946v1)

**Summary:**

The Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity is conventionally formulated in terms of the Einstein-Hilbert-York-Gibbons-Hawking action. However, there is a unique, canonical teleparallel reformulation which reproduces the same results without subtractions or other ambiguities. This is verified in the case of a black hole with or without an electric or a magnetic charge. Further, it is conjectured that the results may be improved in a local prescription which reduces the canonicalteleparallel action to a surface integral over the horizon.

## 12. Deformation quantization in FLRW geometries

**Authors:** Alfonso F. Bobadilla, Jose A. R. Cembranos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13920v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the application of deformation quantization to the system of a free particle evolving within a universe described by a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. This approach allows us to analyze the dynamics of classical and quantum phase-space distributions in curved spacetime. We demonstrate that when the curvature of the spatial sections is non-zero, the classical Liouville equation and its quantum counterpart, represented by the Moyal equation, exhibit distinct behaviors. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between quantum mechanics, phase- space formulations, and cosmological expansion.

## 13. Minimal extension of the Standard Model with a mirror symmetry between   fundamental fermions and a possible origin of dark matter

**Authors:** Jakub Rembieliński

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13829v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we propose a specific, nontrivial extension of the Standard Model of weak interactions based on the SU(2) group. An intriguing feature of the model is the emergence of a mirror symmetry between neutrinos and electrically charged leptons, as well as between up and down quarks. Our model accounts for both chiral components of the neutrino and offers an explanation for the non-observability of the right-chiral Neutrino.

## 14. $e^+ e^- \to μ^+ μ^-$ in the Asymptotically Safe Standard Model

**Authors:** Álvaro Pastor-Gutiérrez, Jan M. Pawlowski, Manuel Reichert, Giacomo Ruisi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13800v1)

**Summary:**

Study the electron-positron to muon--anti-muon cross-section in the asymptotically safe Standard Model. Findings provide non-trivial evidence for the unitarity of the Standard Model, says the study. The study was published in the journal Theoretical Astrophysics and Particle Physics (ASAP) (http://www.asap.org/news/2013/01/27/asap- Astrophysiology-and-Particle-Physics-2013-01-27/").

## 15. Black holes and their shadows in $F(R)$ gravity

**Authors:** Shin'ichi Nojiri, S. D. Odintsov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13775v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the radii of the photon sphere and the black hole shadow in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity. For this purpose, we derive the field equation for the corresponding theory when the general spherically symmetric and static configuration is considered. This equation is the third-order differential equation with respect to $F_R(r)$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. Solving the equation, we find $F('R')$ as a function of $r$, $F 'R' is the scalar curvature.

## 16. Testing local position invariance with odd multipoles of galaxy   clustering statistics

**Authors:** Takuya Inoue, Teppei Okumura, Shohei Saga, Atsushi Taruya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13701v1)

**Summary:**

The LPI asserts that the outcomes of the non-gravitational experiments are identical regardless of location in spacetime. Measurement of the gravitational redshift effect encoded in galaxy clustering provides a powerful and novel cosmological probe of the LPI. We demonstrate that combining the octupole and dipole moments significantly improves the constraints, particularly when the analysis is restricted to larger scales. Our results highlight the importance of higher-order multipoles in constraining $\alpha$, providing a more robust approach to testing the EEP.

## 17. Black Hole Shadow and other Observables away from the Horizon: Extending   the Effective Metric Descriptions

**Authors:** Manuel Del Piano, Stefan Hohenegger, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13673v1)

**Summary:**

In previous work we have developed a model-independent, effective description of quantum deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The deformations of the metric are captured by two functions of the physical distance to the horizon, which are provided in the form of self-consistent Taylor series expansions. We provide explicit approximations of physical observables that depend on finitely many effective parameters of the deformed black hole geometry, depending on the order of the Pad\'e approximant. We illustrate our results for a number of quantum black holes previously proposed in the literature.

## 18. Non-locality in Quadrupolar Gravitational Radiation

**Authors:** Salvatore Capozziello, Maurizio Capriolo, Amodio Carleo, Gaetano Lambiase

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13629v1)

**Summary:**

General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been overcome. It predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a perturbative renormalizable theory. In this paper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by exploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system. We find that the General Relativity quadrupole formula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible signature ofnon-locality.

## 19. Neutron stars with a dark-energy core from the Chaplygin gas

**Authors:** Juan M. Z. Pretel, Mariana Dutra, Sergio B. Duarte

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13568v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the effect of a Chaplygin dark fluid (CDF) core on neutron stars (NSs) We compare our theoretical predictions with several observational mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability constraints. These comparisons together with the radial stability analysis show that the existence of NSs with a dark-energy core is possible. We conclude that this study shows that a neutron star with a CDF core can be predicted and that it is possible to make such a star in the universe. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 20. Dynamical formation of axionic hair around charged black hole

**Authors:** Yu-Peng Zhang, Si-Jiang Yang, Shao-Wen Wei, Wen-Di Guo, Yu-Xiao Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13481v1)

**Summary:**

Included in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, axionic scalar potential can decrease or increase the irreducible mass of the final scalarized black hole. The value of the scalar field on the apparent horizon decreases with the inclusion of the axionic potential. Our results contribute to an important understanding of the dynamical scalarization of black holes and the potential configurations of scalar hair with various self-interactions, the authors say. The study was published in the Journal of Physics and Astronomy.

## 21. Luminal Scalar-Tensor theories for a not so dark Dark Energy

**Authors:** S. Mironov, A. Shtennikova, M. Valencia-Villegas

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13460v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational Waves (GWs) in Scalar-Tensor modifications of Einstein's gravity is different from the speed of Light. We show that, remarkably, up to 5 self-consistent couplings of the scalar of Dark Energy (DE) to the Photon are enough to make their GWs luminal in a wide set of cases. There is at least a Luminal BH theory for which the GW decay into DE is suppressed in any cosmological background.

## 22. Bell's shadows from satellites

**Authors:** Stav Haldar, Rachel L. McDonald, Sage Ducoing, Ivan Agullo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13416v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13416v1)

**Summary:**

Establishing reliable quantum links between a network of satellites and ground stations is a crucial step towards realizing a wide range of satellite-based quantum protocols. These include global quantum networks, distributed sensing, quantum key distribution, and quantum clock synchronization. In this article, we envision a network where quantum links are created through the exchange of entangled photon pairs. We simulate the dynamics of a satellite constellation and a set of Bell tests between the constellation and ground station. We identify the regions on Earth where Bell tests can be successfully conducted with a satellite.

## 23. Dual relativity and its cosmological consequences

**Authors:** V. I. Tselyaev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13400v1)

**Summary:**

A new version of the modified theory of gravity is formulated in which two physical metrics are constructed out of two vierbeins connected with each other by the duality condition. The energy-momentum tensor density of a closed system is defined, and the conservation law for this tensordensity is deduced. In the TDR it is assumed that there exist two kinds of matter governed by the mutually dual physical metrics, and it is shown that the interaction between them has antigravitational character. The TDR gives a better description of the $H(z)$ data as compared to the flat $Lambda$CDM model.
