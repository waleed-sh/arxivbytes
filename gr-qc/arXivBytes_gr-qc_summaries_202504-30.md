## 0. Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Quaia

**Authors:** Giulio Fabbian, David Alonso, Kate Storey-Fisher, Thomas Cornish

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20992v1)

**Summary:**

We analyse the large-scale angular clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia. We use their cross-correlation with maps of the lensing convergence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to constrain the level of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) We target the scale-dependent bias that would be induced by PNG on biased tracers of the matter inhomogeneities on large scales.

## 1. There is no boundary problem

**Authors:** J. François, L. Ravera

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20945v1)

**Summary:**

In General Relativity and gauge field theory, one often encounters a claim, which may be called the boundary problem, according to which "boundaries break diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries" We argue that this statement has the same conceptual structure as the hole argument, and is thus likewise defused by the point-coincidence argument. We show that the boundaryproblem dissolves once it is understood that a physical region, thus its boundary, is relationally and invariantly defined.

## 2. Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions

**Authors:** Rudnei O. Ramos, Gabriel S. Rodrigues

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943v1)

**Summary:**

The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. We revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI. The model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, but its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics.

## 3. Barotropic Equation of State and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Dynamical   Black Hole Spacetimes

**Authors:** Vitalii Vertogradov, Dmitriy Kudryavtcev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20882v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20882v1)

**Summary:**

 models of black holes that differ from idealized vacuum and electrovacuum solutions of Einstein's equations often contain parameters whose physical interpretation is unclear. To propose a black hole model for experimental verification, we must clearly understand which parameters describe the black hole and what physical constraints can be imposed on each parameter. We demonstrate that for physically relevant equations of state, the additional parameter represents a combination of electric and magnetic charges. We can observe remarkable effects related to black hole evaporation, which are associated with the violation of null energy conditions.

## 4. Chaos Around the Kerr Black Hole: its Effects on Entropy and the Shadow

**Authors:** Aydin Tavlayan, Bayram Tekin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876v1)

**Summary:**

Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit chaotic motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. In both of these cases, chaotic motion causes information production. This information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black Hole mass and spin. We show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics.

## 5. Conformal Einstein equation and symplectic flux with a positive   cosmological constant

**Authors:** SK Jahanur Hoque, Pavel Krtous, Carlos Peón-Nieto

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20845v1)

**Summary:**

Fall-off conditions are consistent with a finite, non-trivial presymplectic current on the future boundary of de Sitter. We present an explicit gauge-free computation to show that the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term, counterterm in the action, and fall-off condition of gravitational field in conformal Einstein equation are crucial to reproduce the finite symplectic flux. Our result allows a non-zero gravitational flux across the boundary of the de Sitters, we say.

## 6. Standard constraints on the shadow radius of black holes in   $d$-dimensional space-time: The case of regular Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet   solutions

**Authors:** Zening Yan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20841v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20841v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we propose a $d$-dimensional constraint formula for the black hole shadow radius. This approach can correct the misapplication of shadow radius constraints in some previous studies. We further propose that this $d $-dimensional shadow constraint formula is universal and can be applied to constrain the characteristic parameters in other high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions. The analysis reveals that the characteristic. parameters within these $d#-dimensional black hole. solutions maintain physically meaningful bounded domains under shadow. radius constraints.

## 7. Numerical Relativity Simulations of Dark Matter Admixed Binary Neutron   Stars

**Authors:** Edoardo Giangrandi, Hannes Rueter, Nina Kunert, Mattia Emma, Adrian Abac, Ananya Adhikari, Tim Dietrich, Violetta Sagun, Wolfgang Tichy, Constanca Providencia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20825v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20825v1)

**Summary:**

Binary neutron star mergers provide insight into strong-field gravity and the properties of ultra-dense nuclear matter. These events offer the potential to search for signatures of physics beyond the standard model, including dark matter. Scenarios with a dark matter core tend to exhibit a higher probability of prompt collapse, while those with aDark matter halo develop a common envelope, embedding the whole binary. This highlights the need for refined models in calculating the tidal deformability when considering mergers with extended dark matter structures.

## 8. Effective Metric Description of Charged Black Holes

**Authors:** Mattia Damia Paciarini, Manuel Del Piano, Stefan Hohenegger, Francesco Sannino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20810v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20810v1)

**Summary:**

Charged black holes arise as solutions of General Relativity (GR) coupled to Maxwell theory. As functions of the mass and charge, they can exhibit extremal behavior, in which case they are stable against thermal decay. (Quantum) corrections to GR are expected to alter the classical features of these objects, especially near extremality. To capture such effects in a model-independent way, we extend the Effective Metric Description (EMD) for spherically symmetric and static black holes. The EMD parametrizes deformations of the metric in terms of physical quantities, such as the spatial distance to the event horizon.

## 9. Quasinormal Modes and Shadows of Black Holes in Infinite Derivative   Theory of Gravity

**Authors:** Rupam Jyoti Borah, Umananda Dev Goswami

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20725v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and shadow of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) with higher-order metric corrections, in the framework of the Infinite Derivative theory of Gravity (IDG) We study the effects of corrections to the BH's metric, which arises from the IDG's corrections, on the QNMs. It is found that the system becomes unstable for some values of the free parameters. We also studied the time evolution of a scalar field around the Bh spacetime.

## 10. Static black hole horizons in cosmology

**Authors:** Ida M. Rasulian, Amjad Ashoorioon

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701v1)

**Summary:**

We present a black hole metric that has a static horizon whilst mimicking the cosmological behavior at large scales away from the black hole horizon. This metric does not suffer from issues like a singular horizon for asymptotically vanishing Hubble parameter. The resulting metric is consistent with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric for constant Hubble parameters. It should be noted that this metric doesnot lead to isotropic pressure, i.e. $p_\perp\neq p_r$ for radial distances.

## 11. Challenging $Λ$CDM: 5$σ$ Evidence for a Dynamical Dark Energy   Late-Time Transition

**Authors:** Mateus Scherer, Miguel A. Sabogal, Rafael C. Nunes, Antonio De Felice

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20664v1)

**Summary:**

There has been considerable debate regarding potential evidence for the dynamical nature of dark energy. In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. The strongest evidence is found for Planck+DESI+DESY5. Despite this strong indication, such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension.

## 12. From the Fokker-Planck equation to perturbative QFT's results in de   Sitter space

**Authors:** Alexander Kamenshchik, Polina Petriakova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20646v1)

**Summary:**

A technique to build perturbative series for the spectator field's correlation functions in de Sitter space is proposed. We derive from the first-order differential equation the iterative integral relation for equal- and multi-time correlation functions. With an appropriate integration, the obtained two-point and four-point correlation functions are in agreement with quantum field theory's ones in the leading-logarithm approximation. The results are published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics.

## 13. Horizon Thermodynamics on Nice Slices of the Causal Diamond

**Authors:** Ian Nagle

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20621v1)

**Summary:**

Gravity can be derived from entanglement entropy in conformal field theories. However, this depends crucially on properties of horizons, and asymptotic symmetries of phase space. To explore how this relation behaves under dynamical processes, we consider covariant gravitational phase space enhanced with bulk conformal symmetry. We find a new vector contribution to the Abbott-Deser-Tekin charges that arises for conformal symmetry. In applying this to the causal diamond, we derive a general relation for surface gravity.

## 14. Quasi-normal f-modes of anisotropic quark stars in full general   relativity

**Authors:** Sushovan Mondal, Manjari Bagchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20589v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate f-mode oscillations of anisotropic quark stars within the framework of full general relativity. The dependence of the f- mode frequency on total mass reveals distinct trends based on the relative dominance of tangential and radial pressure. We find that the normalized damping time follows a linear trend with compactness. For a fixed stellar mass, an increase in tangential pressure relative to radial pressure reduces the dampingtime, whereas a decrease in tangentially pressure significantly increases it. The study examines the impact of the pressure anisotropy on the equilibrium structure.

## 15. Thin accretion disk around a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling   universes

**Authors:** Yuxin Ouyang, Xuan Zhou, Songbai Chen, Jiliang Jing

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20582v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20582v1)

**Summary:**

Researchers studied the properties of the thin accretion disk around a swirling-Kerr black hole. An extra swirling parameter described the rotation of the immersed universe. Results show that the swirling parameter imprints in the energy flux, temperature distribution and emission spectra of the disk and gives rise to some new effects differed from those arising from the black hole spin. These results could help us to further understand the properties. of thin accretions disks and the swirling of the universe background. The research was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 16. Evolution of precessing binary black holes on eccentric orbits using   orbit-averaged evolution equations

**Authors:** Khun Sang Phukon, Nathan K. Johnson-McDaniel, Amitesh Singh, Anuradha Gupta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20543v1)

**Summary:**

The most general bound binary black hole (BBH) system has an eccentric orbit and precessing spins. The detection of such a system with significant eccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical formation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve their spins and eccentricity. In this paper, we present a new publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessed BBHs using orbit-averaged post-Newtonian equations.

## 17. Criticality of charged AdS black holes with string clouds in boundary   conformal field theory

**Authors:** Aditya Singh, Sandip Mahish

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20486v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20486v1)

**Summary:**

The aim of this letter is to study the universal thermodynamics and criticality of charged AdS black holes with string clouds. For this system, we determined the critical quantities and noticed that the free energy in the bulk exhibits swallow tail behavior. In the boundary CFT, the presence of second order phase transition is observed. At constant charge, the heat capacity is finite in the Bulk but diverges at critical points in the CFT. We tried to determine the nature of interactions between black hole molecules.

## 18. Modular Channels, Thermal Filtering and the Spectral Emergence of   Spacetime

**Authors:** Pedro J. Trejo-Calderón

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20457v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20457v1)

**Summary:**

The Unruh effect and the Page curve can be understood as manifestations of a universal thermal filtering mechanism governed by the modular Hamiltonian. We reinterpret the first law of entanglement as a Clausius relation for modular flow and derive Einstein's equations by requiring its local validity across Rindler horizons. We propose the Modular Channels Flow Correspondence (MCFC): a minimal holographic principle whereby the area of a causal screen measures the storage of filtered quantum information. Our framework offers a unified operational account of holography, entropy, and curvature, grounded in the spectral dynamics of modular channels.

## 19. Radial Oscillations of the HESS J1731-347 Compact Object via the   Karmarkar Condition in Gravity

**Authors:** Grigoris Panotopoulos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20347v1)

**Summary:**

We model the light HESS J1731-347 compact object within Einstein's General Relativity imposing the Karmarkar condition in gravity for anisotropic stars. The three free parameters of the analytic solution are determined imposing the matching conditions at the surface of the star for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Using well established criteria it is shown that the solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. We study the radial oscillation modes, and we compare to the ones corresponding to an isotropic star modeled by the Tolman IV exact analytic solution. A comparison between the large frequency separations is made as well.

## 20. Solitons and singularities in relativistic ultrastiff fluids

**Authors:** Lorenzo Gavassino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20332v1)

**Summary:**

A mathematical duality exists between massless scalar fields and relativistic fluids governed by an ultrastiff equation of state. This duality entails that certain solutions of the wave equation (a linear theory) can be mapped to solutions of ideal hydrodynamics (an inherently nonlinear theory) We prove that all nonlinear sound waves in such media are solitons. We also demonstrate that, prior to the formation of this singularity, first-order perturbation theory produces divergent results.

## 21. Gaussian tripartite steering in Schwarzschild black hole

**Authors:** Shu-Min Wu, Hao-Yu Wu, Yu-Xuan Wang, Jieci Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20325v1)

**Summary:**

Multipartite steering is a fundamental quantum resource that is uniquely suited to tackling complex relativistic quantum information challenges. We study the distribution of Gaussian tripartite steering in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the Hawking effect can generate inaccessible two-way steering of a bipartite system in both directions, while it can only generate physically inaccessible one-way $2\rightarrow 1$ steering in tripartites. These insights enhance our understanding of the redistribution of multipartite. steering near the event horizon of the black Hole.
