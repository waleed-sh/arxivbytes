## 0. Cosmological constraints on small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity

**Authors:** Jing-Zhi Zhou, Zhi-Chao Li, Di Wu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614v1)

**Summary:**

We study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of the primordial non-Gaussian parameter. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordialPower spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations. We examine the effects of different shapes of thePrimordialPowerSpectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models.

## 1. Local well-posedness of the initial value problem in Einstein-Cartan   theory

**Authors:** Paulo Luz, Filipe C. Mena

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22590v1)

**Summary:**

We study the initial value problem in Einstein-Cartan theory which includes torsion and, therefore, a non-symmetric connection on the spacetime manifold. Generalizing the path of a classical theorem by Choquet-Bruhat and York for the Einstein equations, we use a $n+1$ splitting of the manifold. We prove that the constraint equations are preserved during evolution. Using the Leray-Ohya theory for non-strictly hyperbolic systems we then establish the local geometric well-posedness of the Cauchy problem, for sufficiently regular initial data.

## 2. Applying TDI to Hardware-Simulated Data

**Authors:** Reid Ferguson, Olaf Hartwig, Guido Mueller

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22579v1)

**Summary:**

Software simulations have been used to extensively develop the data analysis libraries to be used in the LISA pipeline. To bridge the gap between these two, we are developing a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to apply realistic, time-varying delays to signals traveling between phasemeters. We have shown that the testbed adds a sufficiently low amount of noise across the entire relevant LISA spectrum. We also injected a realistic gravitational wave signal and successfully extracted it using TDI to remove the obscuring frequency noise of the carrier signal.

## 3. The old problem of the cosmological constant solved?

**Authors:** Jan Novák, Oem Trivedi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22553v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate an approach to quantum gravity, called the ring paradigm. Gravity is mediated superluminally, and the graviton is described as a phonon on the grid of matter in the Universe. This theory has very interesting applications to cosmology and would ultimately solve the old problem of the cosmological constant. It gives new impulses to the scalar field theories because the gravitational ring decays to some phantom field. As is obvious, we radically break the Lorentz invariance, which means that some generalization of the Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius theorem is possible.

## 4. Complete Catalog of Laser Locking Configurations for LISA

**Authors:** Gerhard Heinzel, Javier Álvarez-Vizoso, Miguel Dovale-Álvarez

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22406v1)

**Summary:**

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will enable direct observations of low-frequency gravitational waves. LISA's heterodyne interferometric measurement system requires phase-locking five of its six onboard lasers with tunable frequency offsets. The selection of these offset frequencies is a complex optimization problem constrained by the spacecraft's orbital dynamics and instrument limitations. We present an automated method to explore, validate, and classify viable locking schemes, identifying 36 unique non-frequency-swapping configurations. This exhaustive classification provides a foundation for frequency planning across the full range of operational scenarios.

## 5. Hyperbolic polytrope

**Authors:** M. Carrasco-H, E. Contreras, E. Fuenmayor, P. León

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22383v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we study self-gravitating objects that obey a polytropic equation of state in hyperbolic symmetry. We find that the matter sector exhibits the usual and expected behavior for certain values in this parameter space. We also study the compactness of the dense objects as a function of the poly Tropic index and obtain that it has an upper bound given by the maximum value it reaches for a certain $n$. Some extensions of the work and future proposals are discussed.

## 6. Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with   improved inverse distance ladder

**Authors:** Jia-Le Ling, Guo-Hong Du, Tian-Nuo Li, Jing-Fei Zhang, Shao-Jiang Wang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369v1)

**Summary:**

Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective. Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets.

## 7. Black Bounces in $f(Q)$ Gravity with Magnetic Source

**Authors:** Pınar Kirezli, Doğukan Taşer

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22341v1)

**Summary:**

The source of the black bounce is discussed in the context of $f(Q)$ theory. Black bounce solutions are obtained by violating at least one energy condition for the Simpson-Visser and Bardeen type for an ordinary scalar field. This is only achieved by a phantom field in general relativity. As exact solutions are not obtained, the metric functions are studied in the field equations. The black bounce solution is generated by a combination of a field with a non-zero potential and a magnetic charge within the framework of non-linear electrodynamics.

## 8. Constraining the Hubble parameter with the 21 cm brightness temperature   signal in a universe with inhomogeneities

**Authors:** Subhadeep Mukherjee, Shashank Shekhar Pandey, A. S. Majumdar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22219v1)

**Summary:**

We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. We calibrate the effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data. Our results show that a higher Hubble constant leads to a shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift curve. Such a substantial difference is absent in the standard $Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21Â,cm signal.

## 9. Benincasa-Dowker causal set actions by quantum counting

**Authors:** Sean A. Adamson, Petros Wallden

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22217v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22217v1)

**Summary:**

Causal set theory is an approach to quantum gravity in which spacetime is fundamentally discrete while retaining local Lorentz invariance. The Benincasa--Dowker action is the causal set equivalent to the Einstein--Hilbert action underpinning Einstein's general theory of relativity. We present a running-time quantum algorithm to compute the action in arbitrary spacetime dimensions for causal sets with $n$ elements which is asymptotically optimal and offers a polynomial speed up compared to all known classical or quantum algorithms.

## 10. Condensation of a spinor field at the event horizon

**Authors:** Vladimir Dzhunushaliev, Vladimir Folomeev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22163v1)

**Summary:**

The physical effect of condensation of a classical spinor field at the event horizon is under consideration. The corresponding solution is sought for the set of the Einstein-Dirac equations. It is shown that in this case there arises a black hole with a $\delta$-like classicalspinor field concentrated at the Event Horizon. The solution is shown to be the same as the solution to the equations for the universe as a whole. The black hole is called a supermassive black hole.

## 11. Phase Transition and Critical Phenomena of Charged   Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Black Holes

**Authors:** Zeming Zhuang, Kun Meng, Hongsheng Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22033v1)

**Summary:**

We study the phase transition and critical phenomenon of charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (EMs) theory. A critical threshold emerges where phase transitions become prohibited when scalar charge exceeds a specific magnitude. However, the transition persists asymptotically as scalpar charge approaches zero. The analysis further demonstrates nonlinear relationships between scalar charges and critical parameters. It provides new insights into the interplay between geometric configurations and thermodynamic properties in modified gravity theories. and black hole thermodynamics.

## 12. Gravitational wave signatures of primordial black hole accretion during   early matter domination

**Authors:** Rouzbeh Allahverdi, James B. Dent, Ngo Phuc Duc Loc, Tao Xu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21885v1)

**Summary:**

Primordial black holes (PBHs) could grow by up to two orders of magnitude. We show the gravitational wave spectrum that features two peaks. The high-frequency peak is associated with the PBH formation in the RD phase. We identify a PBH mass range where one or both peaks can be observed by a combination of different GW detectors. Finally, we show the signal-to-noise ratio of the total GW spectrum for PBHs in the asteroid mass window, where they could comprise the totality of dark matter.

## 13. Matter Accumulations and Accretion Tori around Wormholes

**Authors:** Kristian Gjorgjieski, Jutta Kunz, Petya Nedkova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21840v1)

**Summary:**

We study circular orbits and accretion structures around symmetric wormholes. For each of the solutions we identified that vast regions of the parameter space correspond to stable orbits. The presence of this orbit spectrum can be linked through accretion disk models to matter accumulations which may form at the throat. Our results may hint to possible instabilities of wormholes, especially if they have an ergoregion. Moreover, wormholes with such disks, may appear more star-like when it comes to their observational signature, due to the centralized and more spherical emission profile.
