## 0. Gravitational wave anisotropies from axion inflation

**Authors:** Sofia P. Corbà

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13156v1)

**Summary:**

An important prediction of inflation is the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background. Observing this background is challenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of an astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. In this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational wave anisotropies in the cosmological background. This result shows that axion inflation can generate large anisotropic with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave detectors within a reasonable time frame.

## 1. Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode   Polarization

**Authors:** A. I. Lonappan, B. Keating, K. Arnold

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13154v1)

**Summary:**

 Cosmic birefringence$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. We revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic bireFringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of an isotropic bire fringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP.

## 2. Freezing of the renormalized one-loop primordial scalar power spectrum

**Authors:** Matteo Braglia, Lucas Pinol

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13136v1)

**Summary:**

We explicitly prove that the renormalized one-loop power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation freezes exactly on scales larger than its sound horizon. By consistently using the effective field theory of inflationary fluctuations in the decoupling limit, we consistently prove that this is the case. We also show that this freezing occurs on a scale larger than the sound horizon, and that it is not due to a quantum leap in the speed of light. We conclude by saying that this freezes on the scale of the universe’s speed of sound.

## 3. Proca theory of four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet gravity and   black holes with primary hair

**Authors:** Christos Charmousis, Pedro G. S. Fernandes, Mokhtar Hassaine

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13084v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce a novel, well-defined four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity by applying a dimensional regularization procedure. We then consider the static spherically symmetric solutions of this theory and find black hole solutions that acquire primary hair. One of the integration constants associated with the Proca field is not manifest in the original metric, but under a disformal transformation of the seed solution, it emerges as a second, independentPrimary hair. This additional hair acts as an effective cosmological constant in the disformed geometry, even in the absence of a bare cosmologically constant term.

## 4. Radiative properties of a nonsingular black hole: Hawking radiation and   gray-body factor

**Authors:** Asier Alonso-Bardaji, David Brizuela, Marc Schneider

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13050v1)

**Summary:**

We study the radiative properties of a spherical and singularity-free black-hole geometry. Contrary to the Schwarzschild spacetime, this geometry is geodesically complete and regular. Since the gravitational potential is shallower than in Schwarzschild, the emission spectrum turns out to be colder and purer (less gray) We conclude that, instead of completely evaporating, it naturally leads to a remnant, which provides a possible resolution of the information loss issue. We explicitly compute the spectrum of the Hawking radiation and the gray-body factor.

## 5. Competing Bosonic Reactions: Insight from Exactly Solvable   Time-Dependent Models

**Authors:** Fumika Suzuki, Rajesh K. Malla, Nikolai A. Sinitsyn

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13027v1)

**Summary:**

We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class. We also discuss the application of these models to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum.

## 6. Adaptive Modeling of Correlated Noise in Space-Based Gravitational Wave   Detectors

**Authors:** Ya-Nan Li, Yi-Ming Hu, En-Kun Li

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12983v1)

**Summary:**

Accurately estimating the statistical properties of noise is important in space-based gravitational wave data analysis. Traditional methods often assume uncorrelated noise or impose restrictive parametric forms on cross-channel correlations, which could lead to biased estimation in complex instrumental noise. This paper introduces a spline-based framework with trans-dimensional Bayesian inference to reconstruct the full noise covariance matrix. The developed software can recover the features of the noise power spectrum curves with a relative error of 10% for both auto- and cross-one.

## 7. The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter,   Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity

**Authors:** Alexander Shalyt-Margolin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12968v1)

**Summary:**

In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns.

## 8. Palatini Linear Attractors Are Back in ACTion

**Authors:** Christian Dioguardi, Alexandros Karam

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12937v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12937v1)

**Summary:**

Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ in excellent agreement with the prediction of linear inflation. However, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio $r $ is in tension with current observational bounds. In this work, we investigate how this tension can be alleviated in the Palatini formulation of gravity. We show that a linear potential can yield values of $r$ consistent with observations for sufficiently large $\alpha$.

## 9. Dynamics of Geometric Invariants in the Asymptotically Hyperboloidal   Setting: Energy and Linear Momentum

**Authors:** Anna Sancassani, Saradha Senthil Velu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12927v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the evolution of geometric invariants in the context of asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets. Our focus lies on the charges of energy and linear momentum, and we study their behavior under the Einstein evolution equations. We define E-P chargeability as a property of the initial data set and we show that it is preserved under the evolution for our choice of time function. This ensures that the charges are well-defined along the evolution, which is crucial for our approach.

## 10. Physical limits on information metrics and quantum gravity as gravitized   quantum theory

**Authors:** Per Berglund, Andrew Geraci, Tristan Hubsch, David Mattingly, Djordje Minic

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12925v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12925v1)

**Summary:**

There is a long history in both general relativity and quantum mechanics of removing fixed background structures, thereby making observed objects and measurement processes dynamical. We argue that physical limits on information collection resulting from quantum gravity coupled with general covariance preclude fixed information geometry. As a consequence there must be a gravitized, generally covariant extension of both theories. We also propose a novel experimental test involving intrinsic triple and higher order quantum interferences that would provide evidence for dynamical information metrics and a dynamical Born rule.

## 11. Retarded Causal Set Propagator in 2D Anti de-Sitter Spacetime

**Authors:** Arsim Kastrati, Haye Hinrichsen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12919v1)

**Summary:**

Causal Set Theory (CST) is a framework for discretizing anti-de Sitter spacetime. In CST, spacetime is modeled as a locally finite, partially ordered set that reflects the causal structure of events. This fundamentally discrete perspective has shown promise in flat spacetime scenarios, while its application to curved geometries is a current field of study. We show that the causal set propagator accurately captures the effects of curvature without requiring modifications to the flat-space jump amplitudes.

## 12. Euclidean Thermodynamics and Lyapunov Exponents of   Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS Black Holes

**Authors:** Karthik R., Dillirajan D., K. M. Ajith, Kartheek Hegde, Shreyas Punacha, A. Naveena Kumara

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12890v1)

**Summary:**

We study the thermodynamics of Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS black holes via the Euclidean path integral method. By analyzing unstable timelike and null circular geodesics, we demonstrate that their Lyapunov exponents reflect the thermodynamic phase structure. These results extend previous insights from black hole spacetimes with Abelian charges to scenarios involving nonlinear, non-Abelian gauge fields. They highlight the interplay between black hole thermodynamics and chaotic dynamics.

## 13. Note on conserved currents in static Conformal Killing Gravity

**Authors:** Carlo Alberto Mantica, Luca Guido Molinari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12840v1)

**Summary:**

 Conserved currents are discussed for static Conformal Killing Gravity, with explicit expressions in static spherical symmetry with anisotropic matter fluid or coupled to (non)linear electromagnetism. They are found in the reformulation of the third order equations by Harada as Einstein equations with sources supplemented by a divergence-free conformal Killing tensor. They can also be found in a more general form, such as the Einstein-Harada equations with a divergence free conformal Death tensor, or the Einstein equation with a divergent-free Killing Tensor.

## 14. Magnetized black holes in Kaluza-Klein theory and the Kerr/CFT   correspondence

**Authors:** Haryanto M. Siahaan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12786v1)

**Summary:**

Kerr/CFT holography persists beyond the traditional Einstein--Maxwell framework. The massless neutral scalar field equation here is fully separable into radial and angular parts. This separability reveals a hidden conformal symmetry in the near--horizon, low--frequency regime. It provides further support for the robustness of Kerr/C FT dualities in extended gravitational theories. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Magnetized Black Holes, Volume 3, Issue 1.

## 15. Quasinormal Modes and Greybody Factors of Scalar Field Perturbations in   the NED Corrected Charged Black Hole Spacetime

**Authors:** Jie Liang, Dong Liu, Zheng-Wen Long

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12743v1)

**Summary:**

Mazharimousavi et al. proposed a nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) model. Based on this model, they constructed a charged black hole solution that includes a logarithmic correction term. The research results show that the oscillation frequencies and decay rates of the low-order QNM modes decrease monotonically with the increase of the NED parameter. These characteristics provide key theoretical predictions and potential observational features for testing and constraining such NED models in a strong gravitational field environment.

## 16. Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving   accelerated detectors?

**Authors:** Dipankar Barman, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674v1)

**Summary:**

In a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum appears to be thermally populated. This thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero. We propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindlers get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, isindependent of the shift parameter, provided it isNon-vanishing.

## 17. Spherical collapse in DHOST theories and EFT of dark energy

**Authors:** Toshiki Takadera, Takashi Hiramatsu, Tsutomu Kobayashi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12656v1)

**Summary:**

We study the nonlinear evolution of matter overdensities using the spherical collapse model in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories beyond Horndeski. We investigate the impact of the EFT parameters characterising DHOST theories on the formation of large-scale structure. We find that the number density of halos is suppressed compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model due to ``beyond Horndedeski'' effects, upon imposing the stability of linear perturbations.

## 18. Hodge Dual Gauge Symmetry in Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory

**Authors:** Kamal Hajian

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12641v1)

**Summary:**

Einstein-aether gravity is a theory that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry. It introduces a preferred direction via a vector field, which is considered to play the role of an aether. We show that the aether vector field in its minimal version is Hodge dual to a gauge field. The gauge symmetry in the dual description has been known for decades and has been used to implement a cosmological constant into the Lagrangian. We prove as a theorem that this holds true for all divergence-less aether fields.

## 19. Long-Lived Quasinormal Modes of Brane-Localized Reissner-Nordström--de   Sitter Black Holes

**Authors:** Zainab Malik

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12570v1)

**Summary:**

We study the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field propagating on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om--de Sitter (RNdS) black hole black hole background on a 3+1-dimensional brane embedded in a higher-dimensional world. We show that the presence of the cosmological constant, black hole charge, and bulk dimensionality significantly affect the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of the scalar perturbations. We observe the emergence of long lived modes and slowly decaying oscillatory tails in the regime of large field mass.
