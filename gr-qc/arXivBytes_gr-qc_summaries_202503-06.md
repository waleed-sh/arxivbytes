## 0. Searching for continuous gravitational waves from highly deformed   compact objects with DECIGO

**Authors:** Andrew L. Miller, Federico De Lillo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03748v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03748v1)

**Summary:**

 DECIGO, a future space-based deci-hertz gravitational-wave interferometer, will be sensitive to severely deformed compact objects, e.g. hybrid stars, neutron stars, or magnetars. We estimate the number of possible compact objects that could be detected with such high deformations. We show that the existence of such compact objects could be probed across a wide parameter space at a fraction of the computational cost of current searches for isolated compact objects and those in binary systems.

## 1. Long Lived Quasinormal Modes of Regular and Extreme Black Holes

**Authors:** Milena Skvortsova

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03650v1)

**Summary:**

Black hole models in a nonlinear modification of the Maxwell electrodynamics were suggested. We study quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field around such black holes and show that they are characterized by a comparatively small damping rate. This suggests the possible existence of arbitrarily long-lived quasinorm modes, called quasi-resonances. The results are published in the journal Phys. Rev. D, 110 (2024) 024021.

## 2. Evolution of human cognition required Einstein's gravitational waves

**Authors:** Bernard F. Schutz, Tsvi Piran, Patrick J. Sutton

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03604v1)

**Summary:**

Human cognition arose on Earth only because the laws of gravity included gravitational waves. Their link is the heat from decays of the radioactive isotopes U-238 and Th-232. This heat, released in Earth's interior, has maintained plate tectonics and likely helped keep Earth's iron core molten. The core's magnetic field has protected all life from annihilation by the solar wind, they say. They say relative brain size, a proxy for cognition, has seen two sharp increases, first for mammals and then for humans.

## 3. Dynamical Cosmological Constant

**Authors:** Giuseppe di Donato, Luigi Pilo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03589v1)

**Summary:**

Dynamical realisation of the equation of state $p +\rho =0$ is studied. A non-pathological dynamics for the perturbations of such a system mimicking a dynamical cosmological constant (DCC) is shown. It is shown that an anisotropic stress must be always present. The Hamiltonian of the system in isolation resembles the one of a Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and linear stability requires that it cannot be positive definite. When DCC is minimally coupled to gravity no dramatic instability is present.

## 4. Benchmarks for quantum communication via gravity

**Authors:** Kristian Toccacelo, Ulrik Lund Andersen, Jonatan Bohr Brask

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03585v1)

**Summary:**

We establish limitations and bounds on the transmission of quantum states between gravitationally interacting mechanical oscillators. This provides benchmarks that can enable tests for quantum features of gravity. We discuss bounds for classical models based on local operations and classical communication when considering coherent-state alphabets. We also discuss the transfer of quantum squeezing for falsifying the Schrodinger-Newton model. The proposal does not require the measurement of Gravitationally induced entanglement and only requires final measurements of a single subsystem.

## 5. Exploring non-supersymmetric black holes with multiple bubbles in   five-dimensional minimal supergravity

**Authors:** Ryotaku Suzuki, Shinya Tomizawa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03458v1)

**Summary:**

The topological censorship theorem suggests that higher dimensional black holes can possess the domain of outer communication (DOC) of nontrivial topology. In this paper, we seek for a black hole coexisting with two bubbles adjacent to the horizon in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, under the assumptions of stationarity and bi-axisymmetry. We combine the inverse scattering method and the Harrison transformation, and we present the conditions for the absence of conical, orbifold and Dirac-Misner string singularities.

## 6. Constraints on inflationary decoherence from attractor model

**Authors:** Zhongkai Wang, Yungui Gong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03349v1)

**Summary:**

 quantum decoherence is one of the proposed solutions to this issue. We treat primordial quantum perturbations as an open quantum system interacting with environmental degrees of freedom during inflation. We numerically compute the corrections to the power spectrum due toDecoherence. The results show significant modifications only on large scales, with a peak appearing at the minimum of the power. spectrum. We constrain the interaction parameter: $10^{-28}\text{Mpc}^{-1}<k_\gamma<0.042\text {Mpc]^{- 1}$.

## 7. Perturbation theory for post-Newtonian neutron stars

**Authors:** Fabian Gittins, Nils Andersson, Shanshan Yin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03345v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03345v1)

**Summary:**

Neutron stars are compact, relativistic bodies that host several extremes of modern physics. To maximise the science inferred from these measurements, we require models that accurately represent the physics. In this study, we consider the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity for the modelling of neutron-star dynamics, with a particular view to model dynamical tides at the late stages of binary inspiral. We show that the perturbation problem is Hermitian and therefore derives from a fundamental Lagrangian.

## 8. Counting Black Hole Microstates at Future Null Infinity

**Authors:** Vahid Reza Shajiee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03297v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a black hole microstate counting method based on the canonical quantization of the asymptotic symmetries of a two-dimensional dilaton-gravity system at future null infinity. We show that a Cardy-type formula leads to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In this scenario, the quantized bulk degrees of freedom act as a source for the dual field theory operators living at futurenull infinity that are soft gravitons of the higher dimensional system, up to some gauge fixing.

## 9. Fast and Precise Spectral Analysis for Dark Matter Searches with LIGO

**Authors:** Alexandre Göttel, Vivien Raymond

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03293v1)

**Summary:**

A new method has been developed for dark matter searches using gravitational-wave detectors. The method combines established dark matter search techniques with insights from computer music analysis. The results show a consistent 15 percent improvement across nearly the entire frequency range, without additional computational costs. With potential for further refinements, this method already offers a solution capable of maximizing the scientific potential of current and future gravitational- wave observatories, the researchers say. The research was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Dark Matter.

## 10. Noetherian Conservation Laws for Photons in Curved Spacetime

**Authors:** Michael K. -H. Kiessling, A. Shadi Tahvildar-Zadeh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03271v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03271v1)

**Summary:**

We formulate a Lorentz-covariant bispinorial wave function and wave equation for a single photon on a curved background with no symmetries. We show the existence of a 10-dimensional set of conservation laws for this equation. We prove that on an asymptotically flat background 8 of these conservation laws yield global, gauge-invariant, ADM-like quantities that together define a covariantly constant self-dual bisp inor.

## 11. Quasinormal Modes and Topological Characteristics of a Schwarzschild   Black Hole Surrounded by the Dehnen Type Dark Matter Halo

**Authors:** Farokhnaz Hosseinifar, Shahin Mamedov, Filip Studnička, Hassan Hassanabadi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03260v1)

**Summary:**

This study explores some properties of a black hole surrounded by a dark matter halo with a Dehnen type density distribution. Specifically focusing on the thermodynamic characteristics, shadow radius, quasinormal modes, and topological charge of thermodynamic potentials associated with this black hole. This black hole features an unstable photon sphere, which contributes to the formation of the black hole shadow. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time (ASST) and is published by the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

## 12. Higgs in The Cosmos

**Authors:** Johann Rafelski, Cheng Tao Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03224v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the Higgs particle in the cosmic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) below the electroweak phase transition temperature. We show that Higgs is neither in abundance (chemical) nor in momentum distribution equilibrium in certain stages of the Universe evolution. Nonequilibrium originates in: For chemical nonequilibrium in the always present irreversible decays into virtual heavy gauge bosons, and; For $T<25$\,GeV in relatively rapid $2\leftrightarrow 1$ formation and decay processes.

## 13. On covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms: Weakly Isolated   Horizons

**Authors:** Alejandro Corichi, Juan D. Reyes, Tatjana Vukasinac

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03216v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03216v1)

**Summary:**

The Hamiltonian description of classical gauge theories is a well studied subject. The two best known approaches, namely the covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms have received a lot of attention in the literature. In our opinion, a full understanding of the relation between them is not available, specially for gauge theories that are defined over regions with boundaries. We analyze different possible interpretations in both approaches and show how one can obtain complete correspondence between results within both formalisms. Along the way, we shed light on the role of boundary terms in the symplectic structure in relation to boundary degrees of freedom.

## 14. Cosmic dynamics and observational constraints in $f(Q)$ gravity with   affine equation of state

**Authors:** Romanshu Garg, G. P. Singh, Ashutosh Singh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03212v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we explore the cosmological implications of $f(Q)$ gravity with an affine equation of state (EoS) We study the impact of affine EoS on the cosmic evolution in model. We show that the non-metricity scalar may describe the unified scenario in which the universe transits from the decelerated expansion into the accelerated expansion. The model parameters are constrained through the Bayesian analysis based on a minimization technique with the observational data of the cosmic chronometer and supernovae type Ia.

## 15. Evaporation of regular black holes in 2D dilaton gravity

**Authors:** Jonathan Barenboim, Andrei V. Frolov, Gabor Kunstatter

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03191v1)

**Summary:**

We present a general class of non-singular black holes in semi-classical, two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The equations of motion for an evaporating black hole including backreaction are solved numerically. Numerical simulations of microscopic black holes yield a final spacetime that is free of apparent horizons and Cauchy horizons. This would imply that the evaporation of regular black holes is a unitary process. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 16. Equations of motion for compact binary systems in general relativity: Do   they depend on the bodies' internal structure at the third post-Newtonian   order?

**Authors:** Clifford M. Will

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03189v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03189v1)

**Summary:**

The equations of motion for compact binary neutron stars at the third post-Newtonian order in general relativity might actually depend on the internal structure of the bodies. These effects could alter the coefficients in the 3PN equations derived using ''point mass'' methods by as much as 100 percent. If these structure-dependent effects are real, but are not incorporated into gravitational waveforms, they could severely impact efforts using next-generation gravitational-wave interferometers to extract information about the equation of state for neutron star matter.

## 17. Charged Gravastar Solutions in the Finch-Skea Framework with   f(\mathbb{Q}) Gravity

**Authors:** M. Sharif, Madiha Ajmal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03162v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we investigate the features of a charged gravastar within the framework of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. We examine some physical properties such as proper length, entropy, energy and the equation of state parameter. We conclude that the compact gravstar structure could be a viable alternative to black holes within this framework. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time (ASST) and is available on the ASST website.

## 18. Bilateral constraints on proton Lorentz violation effects

**Authors:** Ping He, Bo-Qiang Ma

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03124v1)

**Summary:**

The investigation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays has emerged as a fundamental method for testing Lorentz Invariance violation (LV) effects. Recent advances in observational capabilities have resulted in more stringent constraints on LV parameters. This study delves into the potentially anomalous phenomena arising from subluminal and superluminals LV effects, encompassing aspects such as proton decay and atypical threshold behavior of photo-pion production from protons within the GZK region.

## 19. Spacetime perturbations and quasi-teleparallel gravity

**Authors:** Jian Gao, Yuxuan Kang, Mingzhe Li, Yeheng Tong

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03119v1)

**Summary:**

Gravity is identical to curved spacetime. It is manifested by the curvature of a Riemannian spacetime in general relativity but by torsion or non-metricity in teleparallel gravity models. In this paper, we apply these multiple options to the spacetime perturbation theory and seek the possibilities of representing the gravitation of the background and that of theperturbation in separate ways. We show that the perturbations around a R Siemannian background can be described by torion ornon-metrics.

## 20. Periodic Cosmic String Formation and Dynamics

**Authors:** Michael A. Fedderke, Junwu Huang, Nils Siemonsen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03116v1)

**Summary:**

We study string formation and dynamics in a scalar field theory with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. The growth of perturbations leads to the formation of spatially coherent, temporally stable "counter-rotating regions" (CRR) These CRR are separated by domain boundaries that have a large field gradient and zero rotational speed in field space. String or vortex topological defects form, are confined to, and then annihilate periodically on these boundaries. Phenomenologically, periodic bursts of string formation can lead to bursts of gravitational-wave production.

## 21. Using Gravitational Wave Signals to Disentangle Early Matter Dominated   Epochs

**Authors:** Matthew Pearce, Lauren Pearce, Graham White, Csaba Balázs

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03101v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03101v1)

**Summary:**

Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls) We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions.

## 22. Non-Affine Extensions of the Raychaudhuri Equation in the K-essence   Framework

**Authors:** Samit Ganguly, Goutam Manna, Debashis Gangopadhyay, Eduardo Guendelman, Abhijit Bhattacharyya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03076v1)

**Summary:**

The Raychaudhuri equation (RE) governs the evolution of geodesic congruences in curved spacetime. Here, we extend the classical RE by incorporating non-affine parametrization within the framework of k-essence scalar field dynamics. The results suggest a deep connection between scalar fields dynamics and modified gravity, offering new perspectives on the nature of the universe's expansion history. We reinterpret the modified RE as an anti-damped harmonic oscillator, revealing quantum-like effects in cosmic expansion.
