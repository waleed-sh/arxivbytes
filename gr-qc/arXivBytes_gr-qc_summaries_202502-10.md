## 0. De Sitter quantum gravity within the covariant Lorentzian approach to   asymptotic safety

**Authors:** Edoardo D'Angelo, Renata Ferrero, Markus B. Fröb

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05135v1)

**Summary:**

The study is the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges. The study was published in the journal Theoretical and Applied Physics.

## 1. Robustness of Dark Energy Phenomenology Across Different   Parameterizations

**Authors:** William J. Wolf, Carlos García-García, Pedro G. Ferreira

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04929v1)

**Summary:**

The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations.

## 2. Hilbert Bundles and Holographic Space-time: the Hydrodynamic Approach to   Gravity

**Authors:** T. Banks

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04924v1)

**Summary:**

Quantum dynamics is defined in a Hilbert bundle over the space of time-like geodesics on the background geometry. A nesting of diamonds along a given geodesic defines a series of unitary embedding maps of diamond Hilbert spaces into each other. According to the QPR, the largest diamond in the overlap between any two diamonds is identified with a tensor factor in each individual diamond Hilbert space. This brief review summarizes how these ideas play out in a variety of contexts in different dimensions.

## 3. Black Strings and String Clouds Embedded in Anisotropic Quintessence:   Solutions for Scalar Particles and Implications

**Authors:** Maria de Lourdes Deglmann, Leonardo G. Barbosa, Celso de Camargo Barros Jr

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894v1)

**Summary:**

We analyze the spacetime metric associated with a black string surrounded by a cloud of strings and an anisotropic fluid of quintessence in cylindrically symmetric AdS spacetime. We solve Einstein's equation to obtain the explicit form of the metric. We use the confluent Heun function to solve the Klein-Gordon equation for a spin-0 particle near the event horizon. This modification, in principle, could give rise to an observable that we termed as the dark phase.

## 4. Polymer cosmology with polymer matter: Effective dynamics

**Authors:** Aleena Zulfiqar, Syed Moeez Hassan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04875v1)

**Summary:**

The quantum bounce in the early universe is affected as the initial conditions and various physical parameters -- including the scalar field polymer scale -- are varied. We also find, generically, that there is asymmetric evolution across the bounce. We use a presureless dust field as an internal clock, and work with volume variables. We study the effective dynamics of a polymer quantized scalarField living on an effective polymer quantize homogeneous and isotropic background. We find that the quantum bounce is affected by the early Universe's initial conditions.

## 5. Observational constraints on vector-like dark energy

**Authors:** C. S. C. M. Coelho, A. -L. Y. Gschrey, C. J. A. P. Martins

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04828v1)

**Summary:**

The canonical model to explain the recent acceleration of the universe relies on a cosmological constant. Most dynamical dark energy and modified gravity model alternatives are based on scalar fields. One of these involves vector fields: under certain conditions, they can lead to accelerating universes while preserving large-scale homogeneity and isotropy. We report quantitative observational constraints on a model previously proposed by Armend\'ariz-Pic\'on and known as the cosmic triad. The choice of potential does not play a significant role since any such potential is constrained to be relatively flat.

## 6. Null coordinates for quasi-periodic $(1+1)$-dimensional wave operators   on the circle with applications to reducibility

**Authors:** Athanasios Chatzikaleas, Jacques Smulevici

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04826v1)

**Summary:**

We give a novel proof of a recent reducibility result of Berti-Feola-Procesi-Terracina for the quasi-periodically forced linear Klein-Gordon equation. The novelty concerning essentially the analysis of the maximal order terms. The problem of constructing these coordinates is then eventually reduced to that of straightening a vector field with quasi- periodic coefficients. In particular, the method we propose here does not rely on any quantitative Egorov-type result.

## 7. Quasinormal Modes and Dynamical Evolution of Scalar Fields in the   Einstein-Bumblebee Theory with a Cosmological Constant

**Authors:** Hao Hu, Guoxiong Zhu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04782v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04782v1)

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of static, spherically symmetric black holes within the Einstein-Bumblebee gravity model. Through separation of the angular components, the scalar field perturbations outside the black hole are reduced to a purely radial main equation. The study finds that the Lorentz violation parameter $ \ell $ and the cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ significantly influence the QNMs of de Sitter spacetime. These results are supported by the time-domain analysis.

## 8. Constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity with future   ground- and space-based gravitational wave detectors

**Authors:** Bo-Yang Zhang, Tao Zhu, Jian-Ming Yan, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04776v1)

**Summary:**

Future ground- and space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to test general relativity (GR) with greater precision. We investigate the capability of future ground-based GW detectors, the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE), for constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity. Our results show that the combined observations of ET and CE will impose significantly tighter bounds on the energy scale of parity. This scenario also enables bounds onthe graviton mass at $m_g \lesssim 10^{-35}\; {\rm GeV}$.

## 9. Is there a chiral dark dynamo in the universe induced by quantum   correction, Nieh-Yan gravity and Barbero-Immirzi field?

**Authors:** Zhi Fu Gao, Biao Peng Li, L. C. Garcia de Andrade

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04727v1)

**Summary:**

The Immirzi field acts similar to the axion field, as both axial pseudo- vector and vectorial torsion trace appear to be expressed in terms of the 4- gradient. A magnetic field at the QCD phase is found out of $10^{17}$ G, without quantum correction. Given that unitary violation on theoretical grounds may indicate new physics, exploring unitary violations in dark magnetogenesis could be particularly intriguing, say the authors of the study. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal.

## 10. Choosing suitable noise models for nanohertz gravitational-wave   astrophysics

**Authors:** Valentina Di Marco, Andrew Zic, Ryan M. Shannon, Eric Thrane, Atharva D. Kulkarni

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04653v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04653v1)

**Summary:**

Accurately estimating the parameters of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background is essential for understanding its origin. The background is typically modeled with a power-law spectrum, parametrized with an amplitude $A$, which describes its intensity. We investigate how systematic errors, which may plausibly be present in pulsar-timing analyses, can shift inferences about $A, \gamma$. We demonstrate that conservatively incorporating noise sources into the model that are not actually present in the data does not produce bias inferences in practice.
