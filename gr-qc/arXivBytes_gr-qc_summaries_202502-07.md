## 0. Probing Spin-Orbit Resonances with the Binary Black Hole Population

**Authors:** Sylvia Biscoveanu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04278v1)

**Summary:**

Measurements of the binary black hole spin distribution from the growing catalog of gravitational-wave observations can help elucidate the astrophysical processes shaping the formation and evolution of these systems. Spin-orbit resonances are one process of interest, in which the component spin vectors and the orbital angular momentum align into a common plane and jointly precess about the total angular momentum of the system. These resonances occur preferentially in systems formed via isolated binary evolution with strong tidal effects and are difficult to constrain.

## 1. Black Hole Evaporation in Loop Quantum Gravity

**Authors:** Abhay Ashtekar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252v1)

**Summary:**

The conference marked the 50th anniversary of Hawking's seminal paper on black hole radiance. It was clear already from Hawking's analysis that a proper quantum gravity theory would be essential for a more complete understanding of the evaporation process. This task was undertaken in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) two decades ago and by now the literature on the subject is quite rich. The goal of this contribution is to summarize a mainstream perspective that has emerged. The intended audience is the broader gravitational physics community, rather than quantum gravity experts.

## 2. Causality in the maximally extended extreme Reissner--Nordström   spacetime with identifications

**Authors:** Andrzej Krasiński

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04183v1)

**Summary:**

In continuation of the similarly titled paper on the $e^2 < m^2$ Reissner -- Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) metric (arXiv 2409.03786), in this paper it was verified whether it is possible to send (by means of timelike and null geodesics) messages to one's own past in the maximally extended RN spacetime with the asymptotically flat regions being identified. A formal mathematical proof of this thesis is still lacking and desired.

## 3. Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars -- II

**Authors:** Swarnim Shirke, Bikram Keshari Pradhan, Debarati Chatterjee, Laura Sagunski, Jürgen Schaffner-Bielich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04068v1)

**Summary:**

Boson Stars (BSs) are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects (ECO) would manifest as dark Boson stars and can contribute to a certain fraction of the dark matter (DM) in the universe. In this work, we study the fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) of massive BSs and the associated gravitational wave (GW) emission. We find that different parts of the parameters space can, in principle, be probed by the LISA, LIGO, and NEMO detectors.

## 4. On the interplay between the light ray and the magnetic X-ray transforms

**Authors:** Lauri Oksanen, Gabriel P. Paternain, Miika Sarkkinen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04061v1)

**Summary:**

We study the light ray transform acting on tensors on a stationary Lorentzian manifold. Our main result is injectivity up to the natural obstruction as long as the associated magnetic vector field satisfies a finite degree property with respect to the vertical Fourier decomposition on the unit tangent bundle. This is based on an explicit relationship between the geodesic vector field of the LorentZian manifold and the magnetic Vector field. We present our results in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

## 5. Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars and Distinguishability

**Authors:** Swarnim Shirke, Bikram Keshari Pradhan, Debarati Chatterjee, Laura Sagunski, Jürgen Schaffner-Bielich

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04059v1)

**Summary:**

Massive Boson Stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields. The non-radial fundamental oscillations of such massive BSs have been studied only for a few select model parameters so far. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the $f$-mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit. We use it to compare boson star oscillations with the neutron star and black hole quasinormal modes, thus providing a smoking gun for the distinguishability of BSs using gravitational waves.

## 6. Geodesic Trajectories and Photon Sphere Analysis of Magnetically Charged   Black Holes in Nonlinear Electrodynamics

**Authors:** Hira Waseem, Nikko John Leo S. Lobos, Ali Övgün, Reggie C. Pantig

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04044v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing properties of magnetically charged black holes within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. Using numerical techniques, we study the behavior of the photon sphere and demonstrate that a reduction in the sphere radius leads to a correspondingly smaller shadow. These findings suggest that the nonlinear interactions may provide a potential observational signature for identifying NED black holes. In addition, we examine the strong deflection limit for light trajectories near these black holes, focusing on the roles of both the magnetic charge $Q$ and the non linear parameter $xi$

## 7. $\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of   massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes

**Authors:** Marco Calzá

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041v1)

**Summary:**

We introduce and describe a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray- body factors for massless fields with spin. It is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.

## 8. Holographic confining theories on space-times with constant positive   curvature

**Authors:** Jani Kastikainen, Elias Kiritsis, Francesco Nitti

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04036v1)

**Summary:**

 quantum phase transitions are investigated in holographic confining QFTs defined on a fixed constant positive curvature background. We find a competition between two branches of solutions and a phase transition as one varies the space-time curvature. We argue that, depending on the leading asymptotic exponent of the scalar potential, the transition may be first-order or higher-order. The low-curvature phase has the same kind of IR geometry as the flat-space solution, while the high-curved phase has a regular interior.

## 9. Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened   time span

**Authors:** Gang Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03983v1)

**Summary:**

In Paper I, we introduced an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) configuration, hybrid Relay. In Paper II, we further improved its performance in noise characterization by replacing its null stream with a specialized stable channel. In this work, we propose a novel TDI configuration, labeled PD4L, which features minimal null frequencies and a reduced time span. This shorter time span brings several advantages: reducing margins at boundaries of data segments, mitigating frequency aliasing in the high frequency band, and shortening the tail at the end of a signal.

## 10. Axisymmetric stability of neutron stars as extreme rotators in massive   scalar-tensor theory

**Authors:** Alan Tsz-Lok Lam, Kalin V. Staykov, Hao-Jui Kuan, Daniela D. Doneva, Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03973v1)

**Summary:**

Differentially rotating scalarized neutron stars can possess an enormous angular momentum larger than what could possibly be sustained in a neutron star in general relativity. A natural question to ask is whether these solutions are stable and thus can realize in a binary coalescence. We examine the criterion of dynamical stability against axisymmetric perturbations for these ultra-rotators by numerically tracking their nonlinear evolution. We demonstrate that the turning-point criterion still serves as a sufficient condition for asymmetric (in)stability.

## 11. pyEFPE: An improved post-Newtonian waveform model for inspiralling   precessing-eccentric compact binaries

**Authors:** Gonzalo Morras, Geraint Pratten, Patricia Schmidt

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03929v1)

**Summary:**

The measurement of spin-precession and orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals is a key priority in GW astronomy. Despite the growing potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and future detectors to measure eccentric-precessing signals, accurately and efficiently modeling them remains a challenge. In this work, we present pyEFPE, a frequency-domain post-Newtonian (PN) waveform model for the inspiral of precessing-eccentric compact binaries.

## 12. Equivalence principles in Weyl transverse gravity

**Authors:** Ana Alonso-Serrano, Luis J. Garay, Marek Liška

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03888v1)

**Summary:**

There exist two consistent theories of massless, self-interacting gravitons. They differ by their local symmetries: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. We show that these two theories are also the only two metric descriptions of gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions which obey the equivalence principle for test gravitational physics. We further analyse how the weaker formulations of the equivalences principle are realised in Weyltransverse gravity (and its generalisations) The analysis sheds light on the behaviour of matter fields in this theory.

## 13. Weyl symmetry of the gradient-flow in information geometry

**Authors:** Tatsuaki Wada, Sousuke Noda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03866v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03866v1)

**Summary:**

The gradient-flow equations are derived from the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl's gauge transformations. In Weyl integrable geometry, we have related Amari's $alpha$-connections in IG to Weyl invariant connection on the Riemannian manifold equipped with the scaled metric. We have revisited the gradient- flow in information geometry from the perspective of Weyl symmetry. The equations are based on the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl gauge transitions.

## 14. Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold   neutron stars

**Authors:** Rahul Kashyap, Ish Gupta, Arnab Dhani, Monica Bapna, Bangalore Sathyaprakash

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03831v1)

**Summary:**

Bayesian Evidence calculation fOr Model Selection (BEOMS) is used to evaluate Bayesian model selection methods. BEOMS can be adapted to execute model selection for gravitational wave data from other sources. Findings indicate that model selection is most effective when performed in the two-dimensional subspace of component mass and tidal deformability, requiring fewer events to distinguish between EOS models with high confidence. We establish a relationship between the precision of tidal deformable measurements and the accuracy of model selection, taking into account evolving sensitivities of current and planned GW observatories.

## 15. Accretion disk dynamics in Teleparallel Born-Infeld gravity

**Authors:** Ruijing Tang, Shokoufe Faraji, Niayesh Afshordi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03775v1)

**Summary:**

Teleparallel Born-Infeld gravity (TBI) is a modified theory of gravity. It aims to maintain second-order field equations, leading to alternative scenarios for strong gravity and cosmological settings. In this study, we examine the impact of TBI gravity on the physical characteristics of thin (Novikov-Thorne) accretion disks, focusing on quantities such as flux, pressure, temperature, etc. We also examine the spectral luminosity, comparing it to disks around the Schwarzschild black holes.

## 16. Novel echoes from black holes in conformal Weyl gravity

**Authors:** Mehrab Momennia

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03706v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03706v1)

**Summary:**

We reveal a novel class of echoes from black holes in conformal Weyl gravity. They are generated due to the large-scale structure of the cosmos, rather than near-horizon modifications of black holes as well as wormhole spacetimes. We perform the calculations for the time evolution profiles of scalar perturbations to understand how the linear term in the metric function and the cosmological constant produce echoes. The Prony method is also employed to calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the early-stage quasin formal ringing phase.
