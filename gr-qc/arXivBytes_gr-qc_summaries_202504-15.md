## 0. Cosmology with the angular cross-correlation of gravitational-wave and   galaxy catalogs: forecasts for next-generation interferometers and the Euclid   survey

**Authors:** Alessandro Pedrotti, Michele Mancarella, Julien Bel, Davide Gerosa

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10482v1)

**Summary:**

We study the angular power spectrum of gravitational-wave and galaxy catalogs in tomographic redshift and distance bins as a probe of late-time cosmology. We show that the tomographic angular cross-correlation could determine the Hubble constant to percent or sub-percent precision. This conclusion holds even when marginalising over the unknown tracer biases, primordial power-spectrum parameters and baryon density. We also discuss the use of a spectroscopic redshift catalog, as well as the detectability of the clustering bias of gravitational wave sources.

## 1. Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields

**Authors:** Arko Bhaumik, Theodoros Papanikolaou, Anish Ghoshal

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbation. We show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first- order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGw signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales.

## 2. False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer   and time-averaged observables

**Authors:** Fumiya Sano, Junsei Tokuda

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472v1)

**Summary:**

We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherent rate at one loop. We argue that these diverGences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer.

## 3. Implications of distance duality violation for the $H_0$ tension and   evolving dark energy

**Authors:** Elsa M. Teixeira, William Giarè, Natalie B. Hogg, Thomas Montandon, Adèle Poudou, Vivian Poulin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10464v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate whether a violation of the distance duality relation (DDR) can explain the Hubble tension. We constrain five phenomenological parameterisations of DDR violation using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements. Two toy models can resolve the tension: a constant offset in the DDR (equivalent to a shift in the calibration of the SNIa data) or a change in the power-law redshift-dependence of the DDR. The Bayesian evidence slightly favours the latter model.

## 4. Holographic Entanglement Entropy in the FLRW Universe

**Authors:** Toshifumi Noumi, Fumiya Sano, Yu-ki Suzuki

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10457v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10457v1)

**Summary:**

We compute a holographic entanglement entropy via Ryu--Takayanagi prescription in the three-dimensional Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe. We find in general that the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in addition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. These conditions provide a necessary condition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with the strongSubadditivity. We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the static patch holography and the half de Sitter holographic.

## 5. Dynamical systems approach to Cold and Warm Inflation within slow-roll   and beyond

**Authors:** Sandip Biswas, Saddam Hussain, Kaushik Bhattacharya

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10454v1)

**Summary:**

In this work, we systematically present a new dynamical systems approach to standard inflationary processes and their variants as constant-roll inflation. Using the techniques presented in our work one can in general investigate the attractor nature of the inflationary models in the phase space. The present work establishes a standard norm for studying dynamical as well as stability issues in any new inflationary system. We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is executable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of cosmological events. If one wishes one can revert back to thecosmological time via an inverse transformation.

## 6. Anchors no more: Using peculiar velocities to constrain $H_0$ and the   primordial Universe without calibrators

**Authors:** Davide Piras, Francesco Sorrenti, Ruth Durrer, Martin Kunz

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10453v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10453v1)

**Summary:**

We develop a novel approach to constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ using supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data. By considering SNIa as tracers of the peculiar velocity field, we can model their distance and their covariance as a function of cosmological parameters. Crucially, we implement a differentiable pipeline in JAX, including efficient emulators and affine sampling, reducing inference time from years to hours on a single GPU. In light of upcoming observations of low redshift SNI a from the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, we make our code publicly available.

## 7. Out of the box approach to Black hole Information paradox

**Authors:** Kiran Adhikari

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10429v1)

**Summary:**

The black hole information loss paradox arises from semiclassical arguments. Resolution to the paradox typically demands violation of quantum mechanics or relativity in domains where they should hold. I propose that in a complete theory of quantum gravity, any region that could collapse into a black hole should already be described by a mixed state. To that end, I present a model in which the universe is in a quantum error-corrected state, such that any local black hole appears mixed and encodes no information locally.

## 8. Can spacetime torsion source an extremely red-tilted cosmological GW   background?

**Authors:** Arko Bhaumik, Bhaswati Mandal, Soumitra SenGupta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10402v1)

**Summary:**

In the presence of spacetime torsion, any generic $f(R)$ model of gravity is conformally dual to a scalar-tensor theory augmented with a second rank antisymmetric massless degree of freedom. We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) that may be sourced directly at the second order by such a torsional field. The resulting second-order induced SGWB, which dominates over the primary inflationary GW background at all scales, peaks only at ultra-low frequencies.

## 9. Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness

**Authors:** Andrea Mondino, Clemens Sämann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380v1)

**Summary:**

The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic LorentZian spaces or smooth spacetimes. The paper establishes several applications, including timelike blow-up tangents and connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory. It also shows that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorent zian Gromova-Husdorff convergence.

## 10. Probing Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Black hole via Thin Accretion Disks and   Shadows with EHT Observations of M87* and Sgr A*

**Authors:** Yingdong Wu, Ziqiang Cai, Zhenglong Ban, Haiyuan Feng, Wei-Qiang Chen

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10327v1)

**Summary:**

We investigated the shadows and thin accretion disks of Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) black hole. We found that the Schwarzschild black hole exhibits the largest shadow radius and the highest observed intensity. Increasing the EMS model parameters leads to a reduction in intensity. Ultimately, our findings suggest that imaging black hole accretion disk does not clearly distinguish among these three types of black holes. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Light and Space (ASL)

## 11. Extended-BMS Anomalies and Flat Space Holography

**Authors:** Laurent Baulieu, Luca Ciambelli, Tom Wetzstein

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10304v1)

**Summary:**

We classify the Lagrangians and anomalies of an extended BMS field theory using BRST methods. We find that supertranslations are anomaly-free, while superrotations exhibit independent central charges. The absence of supertranslation anomalies aligns with Weinberg's soft graviton theorem being tree-level exact. This work provides a first-principle derivation of the structure of the null boundary field theory. It offers further evidence for the holographic principle in flat space, and its dimensional reduction.

## 12. Bumblebee cosmology: The FLRW solution and the CMB temperature   anisotropy

**Authors:** Rui Xu, Dandan Xu, Lars Andersson, Pau Amaro Seoane, Lijing Shao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10297v1)

**Summary:**

The researchers used the simplest vector-tensor theory to test the idea of replacing dark energy by a vector field against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation. They found that though the FLRW solution can mimic the evolution of the universe in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the calculated CMB temperature power spectrum shows unavoidable discrepancies from the CMB power spectrum measurements. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Light and Space. It is published by the Royal Society of London.

## 13. Gravity-induced emergence of the Fermi scale in quantum quadratic   gravity

**Authors:** Mohammad Mehrafarin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10293v1)

**Summary:**

In the framework of asymptotic safety, we study quantum quadratic gravity in the presence of the Higgs field considered as non-separable from the vacuum. At this fixed point the symmetry breaks and the Fermi scale emerges. Gravity at the UV scale is purely quadRatic whereas at the Fermani scale it is linear. In the intermediate region both contributions are relevant, giving rise to Einstein gravity and the electroweak phase transition. The latter renders the ghost graviton an unstable high mass resonance which renders unitarity.

## 14. Eccentric mergers of binary Proca stars

**Authors:** Gabriele Palloni, Nicolas Sanchis-Gual, José A. Font, Carlos Herdeiro, Eugen Radu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10235v1)

**Summary:**

We present a numerical relativity study of eccentric mergers of equal-mass rotating Proca stars. We examine how the internal phase structure of the Proca field influences the merger dynamics and the properties of the emitted GWs. Our simulations demonstrate that the relative phase has paramount impact on the post-merger evolution. Our findings offer new insights into the phenomenology of bosonic star mergers and the potential astrophysical role of ultralight bosonic fields. Back to Mail Online home.

## 15. Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Eccentric Binary Neutron Star   Mergers

**Authors:** Anna Neuweiler, Tim Dietrich, Bernd Brügmann

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10228v1)

**Summary:**

Highly eccentric binary neutron star mergers exhibit unique signatures compared to quasi-circular ones. The influence of the magnetic field is too weak to affect the general pre-merger dynamics. However, close encounters in eccentric systems could potentially trigger magneto-hydrodynamic instabilities. We study the f-mode oscillations excited by tidal interaction in close encounters and find good agreement with predicted f- mode frequency estimates. We find a correlation between eccentricity and mass ejection, with a higher impact parameter leading to a larger amount of unbound material.

## 16. Black Hole Singularities from Holographic Complexity

**Authors:** Vyshnav Mohan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10194v1)

**Summary:**

Using a second law of complexity, we prove a black hole singularity theorem. We show that their existence implies null geodesic incompleteness inside globally hyperbolic black holes. We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume of extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the singularity. In static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the growing rate of spacelike extremal surface going to zero at the singularities.

## 17. A parametrized spin-precessing inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model   for tests of general relativity

**Authors:** Lorenzo Pompili, Elisa Maggio, Hector O. Silva, Alessandra Buonanno

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10130v1)

**Summary:**

The coalescence of binary black holes (BBHs) provides a unique arena to test general relativity (GR) in the dynamical, strong-field regime. To this end, we present pSEOBNRv5PHM, a parametrized, multipolar, spin-precessing waveform model for BBHs in quasicircular orbits. The free deviation parameters can be used to perform null tests of GR using current and future gravitational-wave observations.

## 18. Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform   Approximation Approach

**Authors:** Anna Moreso Serra, Oleg Bulashenko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128v1)

**Summary:**

We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA) We focus on binary mass lenses-axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength and redshifted lens mass.

## 19. Heat Kernel methods in the first-order formalism

**Authors:** Abhishek Kumar Mehta

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10115v1)

**Summary:**

In this paper, we extend the heat kernel methods to the first-order formalism of gravity, specifically, in the language of differential forms. This allows us to compute the effective dynamics of 4D gravity when the tetrad degrees of freedom are integrated out. We show that the resulting effective field theory is the Lorentz gauge theory. The paper was published in the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics on November 14. For more information, visit the journal's website. The article was originally published on November 13, 2013.

## 20. Axion-like Dark Matter Search with Space-based Gravitational Wave   Detectors

**Authors:** Run-Min Yao, Xiao-Jun Bi, Peng-Fei Yin, Qing-Guo Huang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10083v1)

**Summary:**

We propose a novel modification to the optical benches of space-based gravitational wave detectors (SGWDs) to enable the detection of axion-like dark matter (ALDM)-induced birefringence. Our design introduces an auxiliary interferometer to convert polarization modulation into measurable phase shifts. This approach preserves the original interferometric stability while enabling new physics capabilities for SGWDs. We show complementary coverage across the ALDM mass range $10^{-19}\sim10-14}\mathrm{eV}$.

## 21. Gravitational metamaterials from optical properties of spacetime media

**Authors:** Orlando Luongo

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09987v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09987v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational optical properties are here investigated under the hypothesis of spherically-symmetric spacetimes behaving as media. The infrared and ultraviolet gravity regimes are thus discussed, obtaining bounds from the Solar System, neutron stars and white dwarfs, respectively. We conjecture that gravitational metamaterials exhibit a particle-like behavior, contributing to dark matter and propose three toy models, highlighting possible advantages and limitations of their use. We thus construct modifications of the quantum propagator as due to nonminimal couplings between curvature and external matter-like fields.

## 22. The gravitational index of a small black ring

**Authors:** Subhodip Bandyopadhyay, Gurmeet Singh Punia, Yogesh K. Srivastava, Amitabh Virmani

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09982v1)

**Summary:**

Small black rings in a five-dimensional string theory have zero area event horizon. The 4D-5D connection relates these small rings to small black holes without angular momentum in one less dimension. The dominant contribution comes from a black ring saddle that rotates in both independent planes in five dimensions. We also write the saddle solution as a three-center Bena-Warner solution. We propose an analogous saddle solution for a 5-dimensional small black ring. It is a four-dimensional black ring with a finite area event Horizon.

## 23. Spontaneous Vectorization in the Einstein-Born-Infeld-Vector Model

**Authors:** Guang-Zai Ye, Chong-Ye Chen, Chao Niu, Cheng-Yong Zhang, Peng Liu

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09821v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09821v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate spontaneous vectorization in the Einstein-Born-Infeld- Vector (EBIV) model. We focus on their domain of existence, thermodynamic properties, and energy distributions. In RN-like BI backgrounds, vectorized solutions emerge from the perturbative instability threshold and persist down to extremality. Conversely, in Schwarzschild-like backgrounds, VBIBHs show bifurcation behavior with two coexisting solution branches, only one of which is thermodynamically favored.

## 24. Harvesting entanglement from the cylindrical gravitational wave   spacetime

**Authors:** Feifan He, Yongjie Pan, Baocheng Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09815v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09815v1)

**Summary:**

Two spatially separated detectors can extract entanglement from the specific spacetime in the presence of gravitational waves. The enhanced detectability demonstrates the advantages of cylindrical symmetric gravitational waves, says the study. The research is based on the theory of Einstein and Rosen, who first proposed the idea in Einstein's Theory of Relativistic Quantum Gravity. The study was published in the journal of Theoretical Physics and Theory of Quantum Entanglement, which is published by the Royal Institute of Technology, London.
