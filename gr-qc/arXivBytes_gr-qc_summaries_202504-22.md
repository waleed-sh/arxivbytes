## 0. Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?

**Authors:** Deng Wang, David Mota

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222v1)

**Summary:**

A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time. DESI collaboration has reported evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust.

## 1. Physical vs phantom dark energy after DESI: thawing quintessence in a   curved background

**Authors:** Bikash R. Dinda, Roy Maartens

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15190v1)

**Summary:**

Recent data from DESI provide moderate evidence of dynamical dark energy, $w\neq-1$. In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization of $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical. We find that thawing quintessence with nonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data slightly better than $w 0, w a$ in a flat background.

## 2. Uniqueness of electrically and magnetically charged phantom wormholes

**Authors:** Marek Rogatko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15174v1)

**Summary:**

We prove the uniqueness theorem for static spherically symmetric traversable wormholes with two asymptotically flat ends. The key role in the proof is bounded with conformal positive energy theorem. For the completeness of the results, we also consider the case of phantom U(1)- gauge field. We conclude that we have found the solutions of the Einstein-phantom-electric-magnetic equations of motion for the wormhole case. The proof is based on the theory of quantum entanglement.

## 3. FRB cosmology with the RM-PRS Luminosity Correlation

**Authors:** Ran Gao, He Gao, Zhengxiang Li, Yuan-Pei Yang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15119v1)

**Summary:**

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation. Using the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated FRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 = 86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03} (68\% CL) Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $ H_0$ to 4.5\%.

## 4. Configuration Requirements for 21-cm Forest Background Quasar Searches   with the Moon-based Interferometer

**Authors:** Siyuan Zhang, Qi Niu, Yichao Li, Xin Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15086v1)

**Summary:**

The 21-cm forest offers a powerful cosmological probe of the thermal history and small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) Its success depends on the availability of high-redshift radio-loud quasars (HzRLQs) as background sources. We investigate the configuration requirements for a Moon-based low-frequency radio interferometer aimed at maximizing the detection of HzRL Qs for future 21- cm forest studies.

## 5. Note on Type $III_1$ Algebras in $ c= 1$ String Theory and Bulk Causal   Diamonds

**Authors:** T. Banks

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15076v1)

**Summary:**

We argue that the Leutheusser-Liu procedure of isolating a von Neumann algebra in the $N = \infty$ limit of string theories, leads to the algebra of relativistic fermion fields on a half line for the $c = 1$ string theory. This model is well known to be integrable and have no black hole excitations. We have speculated that adding an interaction invisible in perturbation theory to a large finite number, $M$ of copies of the model, produces a non-integrable model.

## 6. Effective Starobinsky pre-inflation

**Authors:** Hardik Jitendra Kuralkar, Sukanta Panda, Archit Vidyarthi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15061v1)

**Summary:**

We find higher-derivative instabilities that are shown to decay into scalarons and causing an effective kinetic-domination stage where the universe behaves as a stiff fluid. Through slow cosmological expansion, the kination stage leads to inflation. We find a natural cut-off for the scalaron magnitude ensuring positivity of the modified kinetic term which matches Planck constraints on inflaton energy density at the pivot scale. Even for arbitrary initial conditions, kination naturally leads to the inflationary epoch without the need for fine-tuning.

## 7. Analytical constraints on gravitational models with a quadratic Weyl   tensor

**Authors:** Benjamin Sutton, Antonio de Felice, Mairi Sakellariadou

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15005v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15005v1)

**Summary:**

We set analytical constraints on the parameter space of models of gravity containing a term quadratic in Weyl curvature. In this class of models, there are four propagating tensorial degrees of freedom. We consider the era of matter domination, and requiring that growth of perturbations are recovered in the scalar sector and classical instabilities are eliminated in the vector and tensor sectors. We obtain bounds on the free coupling parameter to thequadratic Weyl curve term, $10^{14}H^2_0 \lesssim $-\alpha C^2$.

## 8. Bayesian model selection of Primordial Black Holes and Dressed   Primordial Black Holes with lensed Gravitational Waves

**Authors:** Xin-yi Lin, Zhengxiang Li, Jian-dong Zhang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14980v1)

**Summary:**

If primordial black holes (PBHs) coexist, PBHs will be surrounded by particle DM, forming celestial objects known as dressed PBHS. In the high-frequency regime, the gravitational lensing effect of bare PBH's is similar to that of dPBH's. Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are particularly sensitive to high- frequency GW signals. In this work, we incorporate d PBH models with GW observations and employ Bayesian inference techniques.

## 9. Shock waves in classical dust collapse

**Authors:** Viqar Husain, Hassan Mehmood

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14883v1)

**Summary:**

During gravitational collapse of dust in spherical symmetry, matter particles may collide forming shell crossing surfaces (SCS) on which the Einstein equations become indeterministic. We show that there is a unique evolution beyond SCS such that a propagating shock wave forms, the metric remains continuous, and the stress-energy tensor dynamically becomes that of a thin shell. We give numerical simulations that exhibit this result. The study was published in the journal The Astrophysics of Space and Time. For more information, visit: http://www.astrophysicsofspace.org/.
