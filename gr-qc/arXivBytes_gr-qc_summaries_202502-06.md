## 0. Cosmic Calipers: Precise and Accurate Neutron Star Radius Measurements   with Next-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors

**Authors:** Sanika Khadkikar, Ish Gupta, Rahul Kashyap, Koustav Chandra, Rossella Gamba, Bangalore Sathyaprakash

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03463v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational waves from merging binary neutron stars carry characteristic information about their astrophysical properties. We use Bayesian inference to quantify the precision with which radius can be inferred. We find that prior choices and the loudness of observed signals limit the precision and accuracy of inferred radii by current detectors. In contrast, next-generation observatories can resolve the radius precisely and accurately, across most of the mass range to within $\lesssim 5\%$ for both soft and stiff equations of state. We also explore how the choice of the neutron star mass prior can influence the inferred masses.

## 1. Heat engines for scale invariant systems dual to black holes

**Authors:** Nikesh Lilani, Manus R. Visser

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363v1)

**Summary:**

According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a novel realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles.

## 2. Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative   Einstein-Maxwell equation

**Authors:** Filip Požar

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337v1)

**Summary:**

In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the Drinfeld twist. We solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the nonCommutative parameter $a$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole. The electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr- newman potential. We introduce a nonzero term proportional to $a$ in the electromagnetic potential.

## 3. Degenerate higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories

**Authors:** Aimeric Colléaux, Karim Noui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03311v1)

**Summary:**

We classify higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories linear in the curvature tensor and quadratic in the derivatives of the electromagnetic field strength. We then classify degenerate non-minimally coupled interactions, obtaining all conformally invariant ones. Finally, we investigate the effect of U(1)-preserving disformal transformations on these degenerate Lagrangians. The ``mimetic" singular transformations are obtained and new ghost-free degenerate theories are generated. This provides a generalisation ofquadratic degenerate higher- order scalar-tensor theories for a U( 1) gauge field.

## 4. Phase space analysis of CCDM cosmologies

**Authors:** Sudip Halder, Jaume de Haro, Supriya Pan, Tapan Saha, Subenoy Chakraborty

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03256v1)

**Summary:**

We perform a detailed investigation of the CCDM (creation of cold dark matter) cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict unstable dark matter dominated critical points, stable accelerating attractors dominated by dark matter or the second fluid, and scaling attractors in which both dark matter and second fluid co-exist. These scenarios also indicate the possibility of decelerating attractors or decelerated scaling attractor in the future.

## 5. SACRA-2D: New axisymmetric general relativistic hydrodynamics code with   fixed mesh refinement

**Authors:** Alan Tsz-Lok Lam, Masaru Shibata

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03223v1)

**Summary:**

A new MPI and OpenMP parallelized, fully relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) code in dynamical spacetime under axial symmetry. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code with some benchmark tests and excellent agreement with other codes in the literature. A wide variety of test simulations, including the head-on collision of black holes, the migration and collapse of neutron stars, and the collapse of a rotating supermassive star to a massive black hole and a disk, are also performed to show the robustness of our new code.

## 6. Landau-Lifshitz Solutions of N=2, D=5 Supergravity

**Authors:** W. A. Sabra

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03195v1)

**Summary:**

We study families of solutions depending only on one coordinate for the theories of N=2,five-dimensional supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. The explicit metrics of the solutions depend on the Jordan normal forms of constrained matrices. Four families of solution, valid for all space-time signatures, are obtained. Examples with three charges are given for the so-called STU model. For more information, visit: http://www.sciencemag.org/article/supergravity-and-theory-of-n-2,5-dimensional-supergravity.

## 7. Exploring Hubble Tension Alleviation through Neutrino-Coupled Perturbed   $f(R)$ Gravity

**Authors:** Muhammad Yarahmadi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03190v1)

**Summary:**

This work examines the Hubble constant (\(H_0) tension within the frameworks of perturbed and coupled gravity. The datasets incorporate the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), lensing, and Pantheon supernovae. We compare the ability of these models to bridge the discrepancy between Planck 2018 and the local R22 measurement. While both models provide insights into addressing the Hubble tension, the coupled gravity with neutrinos offers a more consistent alignment across the datasets.

## 8. Multimode ringdown modelling with $\texttt{qnmfits}$ and   $\texttt{KerrRingdown}$

**Authors:** Lorena Magaña Zertuche, Leda Gao, Eliot Finch, Gregory B. Cook

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03155v1)

**Summary:**

In the last decade, the ringdown community has made large strides in understanding the aftermath of binary black hole mergers through the study of numerical simulations. In this note, we introduce two flavors of fitting algorithms, that have been verified against each other, for the extraction of quasinormal mode amplitudes from ringdown waveforms. The algorithms are available in Python and Mathematica and can be used to create ringdown models. We hope that this will help us to better understand binary black holes and black holes in general.

## 9. Periodic orbits of neutral test particles in Reissner-Nordström   naked singularities

**Authors:** Zoe C S Chan, Yen-Kheng Lim

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03082v1)

**Summary:**

We conduct studies on Levin's taxonomy of periodic orbits for neutral test particles around a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularity. It was known that naked singularities could harbor two distinct regions of time-like bound orbits and thus we expect periodic orbits to appear in both regions. Regions within $(L,E)$-space can be partitioned into multiple domains based on the roots configuration of the quartic polynomial $P(u)$ where $u$ is the inverse radial coordinate. We uncover physical properties of some hypothetical circular orbits residing in the inner region.

## 10. Quantum Cosmology and the Age of the Universe

**Authors:** Álvaro Mozota Frauca

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03075v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03075v1)

**Summary:**

In this article I study how the problem of time of canonical approaches to quantum gravity affects the simple minisuperspace models used in quantum cosmology. In particular, I argue that temporal structures are lost in quantization and that this is a problem, as they encode part of the empirical content of classical cosmology, such as the age of the universe. I follow some authors who have argued that this issue makes the quantization of general relativity problematic to conclude that the same applies in the case of quantumcosmology.

## 11. Observational signature of Lorentz violation in acceleration radiation

**Authors:** Yu Tang, Wentao Liu, Jieci Wang

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03043v1)

**Summary:**

Lorentz violation (LV) has emerged as a vibrant area of research in fundamental physics. Despite predictions from quantum gravity theories that Lorentz symmetry may break down at Planck-scale energies, its low-energy signatures could still be detectable through alternative methods. In this paper, we propose a quantum optical approach to investigate potential LV effects on the acceleration radiation of a freely falling atom within a black hole spacetime. It is found that while LV effects are negligible at high mode frequencies, they become increasingly pronounced at lower frequencies.

## 12. Displacement memory and B-memory in generalised Ellis-Bronnikov   wormholes

**Authors:** Soumya Bhattacharya, Suman Ghosh

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03007v1)

**Summary:**

Gravitational wave (GW) memory effect is studied in the context of generalised Ellis-Bronnikov (GEB) wormholes. We solved the geodesic equations in this wormhole spacetime, in the presence of a GW pulse. The resulting evolution of theGeodesic separation shows the. presence of displacement and velocity memory. Since future GW detectors will be able to probe the memory effect, our work presents GEB spacetime as a black hole mimicker with distinguishing features.

## 13. Non-uniqueness of the shockwave dynamics in effective loop quantum   gravity

**Authors:** Francesco Fazzini

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03003v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03003v1)

**Summary:**

Spherically symmetric effective dust collapse inspired by effective loop quantum cosmology predicts a bounce when the stellar energy density becomes planckian. An extension of the spacetime beyond such singularities is possible through weak solutions of the equations of motion in integral form, leading to the shockwave model. In this work, we show explicitly that such an extension is not unique, and that relevant features like the black hole life-time strongly depend on the choice of the integral form of the equation of motion.

## 14. Probing intermediate-mass black hole binaries with the Lunar   Gravitational-wave Antenna

**Authors:** Hanlin Song, Han Yan, Yacheng Kang, Xian Chen, Junjie Zhao, Lijing Shao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02995v1)

**Summary:**

Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA) is expected to detect GWs in the frequency range from 1 millihertz (mHz) to several hertz. We explore the detectability of IMBH binaries with the LGWA in this work. The LGWA is more sensitive to nearby binaries (i.e. with redshift $z\lesssim0.5$) with the primary mass $m_1 \in [10^4, 10^5]

## 15. Structure formation in the local Universe and the cosmological constant

**Authors:** V. G. Gurzadyan

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02864v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02864v1)

**Summary:**

 structure formation in the local Universe is considered within the weak-field modification of General Relativity involving the cosmological constant. This approach enables to describe the dynamics of groups and clusters of galaxies, to explain the discrepancy in the observational properties of the local (late) and the global (early) Universe. In the local scale this complements the Zeldovich pancake theory of evolution of the primordial density perturbations. The role of the cosMological constant is outlined in rescaling of the physical constants from one aeon to another within the Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.

## 16. Cherenkov emission by fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole

**Authors:** Sergei Khlebnikov, Maxim Lyutikov

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811v1)

**Summary:**

In the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric produces Cherenkov emission. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_g$ is the Schwarzschild radius.
