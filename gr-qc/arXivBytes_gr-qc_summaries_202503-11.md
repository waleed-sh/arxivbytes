## 0. Global Portraits of Inflation in Nonsingular Variables

**Authors:** Laur Järv, Dmitri Kraiko

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07544v1)

**Summary:**

In the phase space perspective, scalar field slow roll inflation is described by a heteroclinic orbit from a saddle type fixed point to a final attractive point. For a comprehensive view of the dynamics a global phase portrait is necessary. In this work we construct a hybrid set of variables which allow the depiction of both the initial and final states distinctly in nonsingular manner. To illustrate the method, we apply these variables to portray various interesting types of scalarField inflationary models like metric Higgs inflation, metric Starobinsky inflation, pole inflation.

## 1. Anomaly Equation of the Large U(1) Chiral Symmetry

**Authors:** Shingo Takeuchi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07525v1)

**Summary:**

In this study, we first heuristically constitute the charges for the chiral transformation associated with the large U(1) gauge symmetry. Then, showing that those can be obtained based on Noether's theorem, we once obtain the anomaly equation associated with those large chiral transformations. It is also shown that those anomaly equations can be derived in Fujikawa method. The result in this study would be important as a development of the big gauge symmetry in the fermionic field. The study was published in the Journal of Theoretical Physics.

## 2. Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum

**Authors:** I. Y. Park, P. Y. Wui

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469v1)

**Summary:**

We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to thecosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmology model to include additional density parameters. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmologically parameter estimation. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the density parameters improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values.

## 3. Causality violation of Schrödinger-Newton equation: direct test on   the horizon?

**Authors:** Lajos Diósi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07458v1)

**Summary:**

A recently proposed optomechanical test of gravity's classicality versus quantumness is based on the nonlinear Schrodinger-Newton equation. We reveal that, in a recently designed experiment, quantum optical monitoring of massive probes predicts fake action-at-a-distance (acausality) on a single probe. The proposed experiment might first include the direct test of this acausality. We quote a definitive simple proof that neither classical stochastic dynamics nor quantum dynamics can be nonlinear.

## 4. On the cosmological degrees of freedom of Proca field with non-minimal   coupling to gravity

**Authors:** Antonio De Felice, Anamaria Hell

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07454v1)

**Summary:**

We study Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity through the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar interactions. We show that in the homogeneous and isotropic Universe together with cosmological constant, the temporal component of the vector field acquires a background value. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vectors field. We showed that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory.

## 5. Quadratic quasinormal modes at null infinity on a Schwarzschild   spacetime

**Authors:** Patrick Bourg, Rodrigo Panosso Macedo, Andrew Spiers, Benjamin Leather, Bonga Béatrice, Adam Pound

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07432v1)

**Summary:**

The ringdown of perturbed black holes has been studied since the 1970s. There is now burgeoning interest in nonlinear perturbative effects during ringdown. Using a hyperboloidal framework, we provide a complete treatment of linear and quadratic quasinormal modes (QNMs) in second-order perturbation theory, in Schwarzschild spacetime. Our numerical results are restricted to perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole, but our methods extend straightforwardly to the astrophysically realistic case of a Kerr black hole.

## 6. BV description of $N = 1$, $D = 4$ Supegravity in the first order   formalism

**Authors:** Alberto S. Cattaneo, Filippo Fila-Robattino

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07373v1)

**Summary:**

This note examines the BV formulation of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in the first-order Palatini--Cartan framework. Challenges in achieving an off-shell formulation are addressed by introducing corrections to the rank 2 BV action. It offers in addition a solid foundation for the study of the theory on manifolds with boundary. For more information on this topic, visit: http://www.theoryonmanifolds.org/supergravity.

## 7. Will LAGEOS and LARES 2 succeed in accurately measuring frame-dragging?

**Authors:** Lorenzo Iorio

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07264v1)

**Summary:**

The current LAGEOS-LARES 2 experiment aims to accurately measure the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitomagnetic field of the spinning Earth. The key quantity to a priori analytically assess the overall systematic uncertainty is the ratio of the classical precessions of the satellites' nodes induced by the Earth's oblateness $J_2$ to the sum of their post-Newtonian counterparts. The consequences of this fact are examined in greater details than done so far in the literature.

## 8. Compactification of Anisotropies in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet   Cosmology

**Authors:** Alex Giacomini, Andronikos Paliathanasis, Alexey Toporensky

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260v1)

**Summary:**

We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes. We find that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe. The study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetime where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropIC configurations where all scale factors evolve identically.

## 9. Is MOND necessarily nonlinear?

**Authors:** Mordehai Milgrom

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07106v1)

**Summary:**

The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot be linear in the mass distribution. This leads to important idiosyncracies of MOND. I show that the DML axioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic, action-based, linear formulation of DML. This model suffers from important drawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND theory.

## 10. Imaging the destruction of a rotating regular black hole

**Authors:** M. F. Fauzi, H. S. Ramadhan, A. Sulaksono, Hasanuddin

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07011v1)

**Summary:**

A regular black hole can exceed its critical spin limit and transition into a superspinar. The transition timescale becomes relevant for supermassive black holes with masses approximately twice that of M87*, making these effects potentially observable with future high-resolution instruments. We explore the image transition of the Ghosh black hole that has been recently destroyed by the capture of a test particle. The resulting images reveal distinct features: the black hole closely resembles its Kerr counterpart with slight deviations, while the supers pinar configuration exhibits an inner ring-like structure.

## 11. A new rotating black hole from the Newman-Janis algorithm

**Authors:** Hyeong-Chan Kim, Wonwoo Lee

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06961v1)

**Summary:**

We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. We use the Newman-Janis algorithm as a mathematical tool that reduces a general rotating metric into a tractable form by applying simple physical requirements. Interestingly, the solution we found may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby challenging the no-hair theorem. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics (hair) affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.

## 12. Analytical description for light propagation with the source inside the   black hole photon sphere

**Authors:** Yuan-Xing Gao

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06895v1)

**Summary:**

The photon sphere defines the unstable circular orbit of photons in a black hole spacetime. Photons emitted by a source located inside the photon sphere can be gravitationally lensed by the black hole and have time delays when reaching the observer. These delays may lead to light echoes produced in the light curve if an accretion event in the vicinity of the horizon can be observed. We present fully analytical formulas with high accuracy to describe the change of the azimuthal angle and the travel time of those photons.

## 13. Quasi-Palatini Formulation of Scalar-Tensor Gravity

**Authors:** Sotirios Karamitsos

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06886v1)

**Summary:**

The Palatini formulation has been successful in the development of several alternative theories of gravity. We propose the "quasi-Palatini" formulation, which gives rise to a continuous family of models. We demonstrate how this leads to a deformation of the potential, studying its impact on observables. We also discuss how the interpolation between different actions can be extended to scalar-torsion and Scalar-nonmetricity models. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

## 14. Testing the Starobinsky model of inflation with resonant cavities

**Authors:** Subhendra Mohanty, Sukanta Panda, Archit Vidyarthi

**Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06858v1)

**Summary:**

Stochastic gravitational waves are produced when the scalaron - which is the massive scalar mode of the metric - decays into gravitons during reheating. This decay is accompanied by decay of scalaron into matter as well through a similar coupling, proving an efficient reheating stage. Their detection could conclusively validate the Starobinsky inflation model. They have characteristic strain $h_c\sim 10^{-35}-10^{-34}$ which makes them accessible to resonant cavity searches for graviton to photon conversions.
